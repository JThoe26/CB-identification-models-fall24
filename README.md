### About
The phenomenon of cyberbullying on social networking sites has become an important societal concern that is also given much scholarly attention. This repository houses a research study aiming to develop the software or model to get bullied tweets, posts, etc. The intended audience for the results of this study includes the cyberspace research community, cyber security platform developers and secure software system developers. Using social cognitive methods to integrate current knowledge and identify areas for new research, this project will examine a range of detection approaches using different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. The main form of data used in this project is comments scrapped from YouTube.

This project expiriements with developing classification models using supervised machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machine and Na√Øve Bayes, or deep learning models like TFIDF and Recurrent Neural Network. To evaluate and compare the model performance, we use measures such as model accuracy, precision, recall, F-1 score, confusion matrix, and RoC curve.
