YOU SHOULDVE LISTENED TO THE PR TEAM GIRL😭
“they never told me I couldn’t sing” what in the ariana grande from victorious
“THEY DIDNT SAY I COULDNT SIIINGGGGG!” -kat from victorious that one episode
You’re very brave for having the comment section on
i didn’t know what her response would be but i never could’ve imagined this.
This is so insulting to the victims.........
I had a feeling Colleen would come back and do something like this
I actually can&#39;t believe this is real. The sad thing is that it is clear she put a bunch of effort into this song.
"Well, I have to hand it to her. This is the most original apology video I’ve seen."
Be so for real Colleen. Make a real apology and take accountability for your actions.
“ The only thing I’ve ever groomed🪒 is my two Persian cats🐈🐈‍⬛ Not a groomer👧 Just a loser🫵” goes hardddd🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
zero days without nonsense
i fucking love the internet so much
This response was a choice
i need a break from 2023
Idk if there&#39;s a NOT creepy way to be messaging young fans lol...
I saw this on Tik Tok and refused to believe it was real. I can’t believe it 💀
keep in mind this is a grown ass woman
We are witnessing history rn 🫡
She only feels sorry for herself. What about the affected children?! Not an ounce of accountability in this „apology“ video…
This is the wildest thing I’ve ever seen on this app
this cant be real
😧 &lt;- me this entire video
I guess she gets points for singing and creativity?
Girl.
The allegations are on film girl
"erm, there’s literally mounts of screenshots and evidence lol"
HE DIDNT SAYYYY I COULDNT SIIIIIIIIIIIINGGG
Bruh.
Life isn&#39;t real 😭
Not a fucking ukulele lmfao
I can&#39;t believe this is real omg
All I can think about is the victims watching this.... I can&#39;t believe this
girl how is it lies and misinformation there is a plethora of truth 😭
"Colleen, this apology video is very well done. Your singing is simply sublime. I especially liked the fact that you played your ukelele in A Minor, you played it very professionally."
Are you kidding me
Colleen you cant be serious with this
this going straight to the playlist 🔥
girl whens this dropping on spotify?
The hook low key slaps
GIRL there’s so much evidence bsfr
Most creative youtuber apology video ever
this is weird as hell lol.
2023 is weird
DELETE THIS WHILE YOU CANNNNN LIKE WHATTTT
this is NOT REAL LMAOOOO
no way 😭
I admire your courage for keeping the comments on.
"People aren’t “having fun” with these “rumors” they are speaking out about trauma you caused. It’s not fun for them to do so. It’s traumatic. But you made it all about you, sorry you feel like shit."
&quot;HE DIDN&#39;T SAY I COULD&#39;T SIIIING!&quot; - Cat Valentine
This is...something
Oof. This ain’t it.
Its giving that vegan teacher
"finally! i can feel bad for you and not the victims. amazing, thank you Colleen."
"Instead of listening to your team, you come out with this tone deaf song. There&#39;s videos of you talking about inappropriate things with CHILDREN! I&#39;m saying this as someone who said and did manipulative shit to others and I thank goodness I had friends who chewed me out. I am telling you now, Collen, you are the wrong. You should not have been talking to children and you&#39;re not taking accountability. You did this video where you sing about how you feel horrible and then you stopped to talking about how people are toxic and how they don&#39;t care about your apologies. It comes off as high and mighty, manipulative as well as flippant. You would have been better not saying anything because now you&#39;ve made sure that everyone knows you don&#39;t care and aren&#39;t taking it seriously."
"Yes, im disappointed in your song. I thought you wuld be an adult for once and take accountability for your actions Colleen."
Vampire by Olivia Rodrigo or Toxic Gossip Train by Colleen Ballinger? Which is the song of the summer
Okay I must say this is creative
Wow this girl is literally playing the victim right now 💀✋🏼 I can’t even
this is the most entertaining app
bro really pulled out the musical instrument lmaooo
GIRL-😭😭😭😭
Im going to quote this for the rest of my life
Horrified looks from everyone in the room… 😳
beyond disrepectful. i feel so bad for the victims.
the chorus lowk goes hard
this is the best youtube apology ever made
Wow…Girl you just seem mad and bitter.
YO WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS LMFAOOOO
🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️
"Colleen, be strong in who you are. We know your heart, and we too can see through the lies.  This response was spot on, gutsy, and true!"
what accountability did you take??🤨
what a banger
Oh this is quirky
You are loved. You are valued. We know you are only human. Don&#39;t let them dim your light.
I feel bad for the victims. This video was probably a slap across the face
THIS CANNOT BE EFFING REAL
THIS CAN&#39;T BE REAL
THE ENDING😭😭
she’s pulling cat’s “he didn’t say i couldn’t sing” omg
This can’t be happening in real time 😩
Catchy though
What in the millennial
it’s giving cat valentine ‘ they didn’t say i couldn’t sing ‘ but from a horrible person .
She really doesn’t care abt this situation at all bc what the fuck is this💀
What is this
LMAOOOOOOOO
This was.... interesting?
Chat is this REAL???? Girl what are you doing????
this is embarrisng
This is catchy 😭
Yikes. Let&#39;s keep the uke out of apology videos.
Like this if your watching in 2024
girl......be fr
Honestly hun you are brave to have comments on 😂😂😂<br><br>She wants that last pay check frfr
Making a situation this serious into a jokey song is just so tone deaf? Yikes
idk what i was expecting from her apology video but NOT THIS 😃
Why is this catchy though
yo this kinda a bop😜😍
cornball
every few weeks i remebrr this exists and i love watching it over and over
"You are really skilled at deflecting!! Go off all the way to accountability town, big yikes."
"this is definitely an odd way of apologizing, but it seems genuine and i feel bad for her"
Y&#39;all need Jesus
steven universe ass response 😭😭
Stay Strong. Don’t let the ohio edgers fanum tax you
This is so 2020.😆😐
it DOESNT matter what your intention is once your actions already hurt others
the beginning is giving cat from victorious singing “they didn’t say i couldn’t singgggg”😭😭😭
I’m sorry that you are going through this. I still believe in you even if no one else does
&quot;he didn&#39;t say i couldn&#39;t sing&quot;
i&#39;m crying what is this 😭😭😭
Geez…
"This song is taken as insensitive , but knowing Colleen it’s her way of showing that she cares."
they didn’t say i couldn’t sing is giving that one episode of victorious where cat can’t talk
This might be the most iconic video of 2023.
girl i never said i was perfect but i do leave kids alone SO ..
I don’t think people understand this video.  It’s very serious.  She’s showing us she isn’t doing well.  Art and music is her way of processing it.  She’s definitely not taking anything lightly. If you know Colleen you know what I mean.
that was… definitely a video!
no fucking way LMAOOO
Girl you could have saved yourself...
"Lmao, Genius 😂"
This is the most unhinged thing I have ever seen. Stop playing the victim when there are actual victims???
Am I in a fever dream….. this can’t really be your response
This was so manipulative “she didn’t deserve to d!e” “she didn’t survive the crash” as if your saying if something happened to you it would be because of everyone calling you out on your bad mistakes? Idkk.
"honestly, i respect the game"
This wasn’t a good idea Colleen 🤦🏻‍♀️
This is such weird behaviour... and creepy.
Way to take this seriously. Smh
I DONT GET HOW ANYONE COULDNT LIKE COLLEEN LIKE SHES SO ICONIC FOR THIS
"gabbie hanna 2.0, she’s finally lost it 💀"
Need an apology video for this video. Immediately. No ukulele or song next time
Bruh
"i cant say how sorry i am that this is all happening to you colleen. just know that the people that really love and support you always will, and people make mistakes because were all human just as you said. we still love you colleen!! im so sorry youre getting these horrifying rumors about you spread all over."
actually no way
this doesn’t look genuine at all omg
girl bye.
this song is a banger tho
Are you kidding me
You took time off and this is what you thought would be the appropriate response? Perhaps more time off is necessary because what is this?
So we’re calling screenshots rumors now?
People these days are so mean and hateful. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone is human. Yeah I&#39;m probably gonna get hate for this..I don&#39;t care I&#39;m still gonna be fan and support her. Take care of yourself Colleen❤
I don’t think ANYONE is having fun.
Yaaaas queen! Give us nothing 🥰
wow she really was homeschooled huh
I believe Colleen..and I believe she is not a bad person.
Most apology of all time
"smh,take account for it instead of whatever is this"
"Shame on you, Colleen. Any small chance you may have had at redemption is long gone."
Girl glad you’re okay. Been waiting for any update from you. Take your time and this too shall pass❤
This can’t be real???
Girl😭
Wait the beginning part is giving cat in victorious saying “ BUT THEY DIDNT SAYY I COULDNT SIIIINGGGGGGG”💀💀💀
So when is this on spotify?
LMAOOO WHAT IS THIS?!?!?!
?
It’s the way you THOUGHT you ate that
I fucking love you Colleen
Wow this is worse than watching micheal scott giving laptop batteries to the kids 😭😭........
oh hell no
Aww thanks but we don&#39;t forgive you ❤❤❤
"❤ as someone who’s your age and found you when we were both already moms, thank you for who you are now. Thank you for the example of a mother you are. I miss your vlogs and your family. Take care of yourself through this storm - know many of us care about you and miss you, it may just not be as loud as some other voices right now ❤"
Woah. Don’t think this was the move you thought it was. 👀 EWWW. Listen to her victims.
Bro not her pulling a cat valentine from victorious &quot;they didn&#39;t say I couldn&#39;t sing&quot; PLEASEEEE
GIRLBYEEEE😭😭
"You have helped me through so so so much, ignore everybody else and listen to me. You are amazing and if some things were pulled from your past that were said wrong, who cares! You have done more good than anybody I have ever met in my whole life. If all of the top comments are mean I hope that you find just this one and you get off your device knowing that you are an amazing human that so many humans love and adore SOOOO much! I hope that one day when you are more comfortable that you will continue to make yt videos because they help me so so so much! I am so glad you made this video, I love you."
girl
what part of the song is about when u killed ur dog
i think staying quite would have been better than this honestly.. making it into a corny song when the allegations have to do with kids.
Absolutely not.
I love you girly ❤ keep your head up.
haha sorry what😂😂 this was not on my list of apologies she was gonna do
A good person wouldn&#39;t make this video
ummm...
Y’all need to let her handle stuff the way she wants. It’s her life
Oh that’s not…
this is so disrespectful to the victims smh
ain&#39;t no way....
I have missed you so much! Sending you giant hugs ❤😞
i didnt think youtube apology videos could get any worse..
did she even say sorry? or like... she says mistake singular
"her PR team told her not to speak on the issue, so she sang about it instead!"
"I support you in this. You already apologized and addressed the things you did wrong years ago, so why should you apologize again for that, and additional things you don&#39;t believe you did? I&#39;m glad to see you aren&#39;t letting cancel culture win and bowing to their demands. Please stay strong against it and don&#39;t cave and delete this or apologize when an apology is not deserved."
I don’t know what to think anymore
Come on here to take accountability? Good one! Hahah you are indeed a comedian.
Girl…. 🤦🏽‍♀️
"Look, people are never going to be happy with any apology she gives no matter what format. If you forgive her, do it. If you don’t, then you’re no better trying to tear someone down day after day."
Gabbie Hanna is that you?
i want to laugh at how ridiculous and embarassing this is for a grown woman to be doing but then i remember the victims and suddenly it ain&#39;t funny anymore
r u serious rn
KEEP YOUR HEAD UP ❤YOUR DOING A GREAT JOB ❤
okay Cat Valentine “he didn’t say I couldn’t siiinnnggg.”<br><br>This is horrific.
Girl what is this response.
How did you make this last ten awful minutes
Honestly if u guys were/ are a fan of Colleen you would be supporting her not trying to tear her down
That was nothing really 😅
When is this dropping on spotify
Wow. Just wow.
We still believe in you Colleen! Stay strong 🩷
ok this just feels like mocking the victims😭
Colleen… you can not be serious. This was the wrong move anything would be better then this.
Ain’t no way 💀💀💀💀
This is a WILD response
I&#39;M YELLING CAUSE EVERYONE ELSE IS YELLING!
Omg.. no way it&#39;s real.. •-•
girl bffr
This is in bad taste
This shit is heat colleen 🙌
This is the only video I&#39;ve seen by you.  I don&#39;t know all the details of this controversy so I&#39;m not going to accuse you of anything.  All I&#39;m saying is that you went about the complete wrong way of addressing it.
girl BFFR.
is accountability in the room
Ain&#39;t even gonna lie this song if fire 🔥
This is so weird.
ok
Hi
I’m glad you responded like this. People have been hating on you so hard for a misunderstanding
Be so fucking for real right now
girl bye
Girl...
Sending you a big hug - Remember that there are still so much love towards you in this fandom &lt;3<br>Love you &lt;3
No. Just no.
What about your brother ?? Umm ok
This is awful. Take it down. It’s really cruel to the victims.
I’ve watched you for 10 years and I’m not going anywhere. I love you and I hope you are okay 😢❤
I’m uh-
seek help
Dropping on Spotify?
Does she do birthday parties?
lmaaoooooooooo no way
HE DIDN&#39;T SAYYYYYY I COULDN&#39;T SINNNGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!
it’s giving cat valentine ‘ they didn’t say i couldn’t sing ‘ but weird..
You really can sing!!!
THEY DIDN’T SAY I COULDN’T SINGGGGG
oh no babe
No…way. Absolutely no way. Wow
"I don’t understand these people or this world anymore. Colleen, you’ve been nothing but an amazing positive influence on my life. You got me through two horrible pregnancies and my babies NICU stay. My daughter and Flynn are months apart, Flynn in two months younger. My NICU girl was born on the same day, one year after your twins and I sat and rewatched your videos crying through the pain with you. You will always hold a special place in my heart and so many others. Thank you for being you and bringing a light to my life for so many years. 🖤"
LOL
This randomly came up and i don&#39;t have any context ...
what the hell girl
I’m proud of you for sticking up for yourself. I don’t think anyone deserves to be persecuted and have their livelihood completely taken away because of past mistakes they have already owned up to and learned from.
"You did change my mind, for the worse. Listen to your team."
What 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
THIS IS AWFUL
You are loved Colleen!
BOO BOOO 🍅🍅🍅🍅
When will this drop on Spotify
Oh no! Colleen this was not better then talking this was worse
&quot;They didn&#39;t say I couldn&#39;t sing&quot;
B IF YOU DONT- 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭💀💀💀💀💀
Taking notes from cat valentine. “He didn’t say I couldn’t siiiiing” 😭
THEY DIDNT SAY I COULDNT SIIINNNGGGGGGGG
"I appreciate you Colleen.<br><br>I understand what you’re going through and have been through similar life ruining slander and betrayal myself.<br><br>Appreciate your art piece here and the message is wonderful.<br><br>Thankyou for expressing, persisting and overall existing,<br><br>Much love❤"
"oh baby, no."
So Colleen decided to completely end her whole career with this video. Even if there was a sliver of a chance she could come back... not after this!
this is so fucking weird😭
When is it dropping on Spotify🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
“They never said I couldn’t SIIIINNGGG” - Cat Valentine
goodnight
👁️👄👁️
Im sorry colleen i know how it feels when it seems no matter what youre still in the wrong. Haters will always hate and they never seem to let the past go no matter how much you have grown since them. I hope you get through this!
Omg Song of the summer?!!!😜
"DIDNT DESERVE TO DIE WHAT,,,,,,"
GIRL BFFR
Girl I love you !!! I wish people understand you are human! I made mistakes that I full regret. Keep strong!!❤❤❤❤
I was here 4:20pm june 28
What a sad excuse of a response💀
this cannot be real life
"I love Colleen, believing everything in the internet from years ago isn&#39;t something I&#39;ll do, I miss you, Flinn, and the twins so much!!"
oop. girl this is... wow😭😭
…
The internet is a magical thing
They didnt say i couldn&#39;t Ssiiiiiingggg
This cannot be real right now
….
.....no
Cancel culture is so weird
girl fr
Are we on the subway??? What the fuck!
You’re kidding
Girl please don’t let these people get to you!!! Your true fans love you and will always stand up for you! We know you and what people are say is not you. Sending the biggest hug!!!❤
No way.
Oh no
"oof. I&#39;ve never seen a Miranda yt vid. I saw you on Comedians in Cars...I couldn&#39;t finish it because I didn&#39;t get the shtick. I did see your pregnancy story videos, tho. This &quot;apology&quot; is pretty abysmal. As a mom and big-time content creator, don&#39;t be sorry, be proactive. Create a commitee of creators to make regulations to protect children on and off all platforms. YT is the wild west. This was a waste of your time."
"Let it out, girl ❤"
girl?
🍅🍅🍅🍅
LOL girl please
Well it changed my mind about you ❤❤❤
it&#39;s... original!
oh my GOD shes weird
wow
ok maybe this is just a starter apology and she&#39;ll make another one
HE DIDN&#39;T SAY I COULDN&#39;T SIIIING!!
That was…..weird.
LMAOOOO??????
Sounds like a hit to me. Can you make a radio edit?
THEY DIDN&#39;T SAY I COULDN&#39;T SINGGGGGG
😂😂This is funny.
SMH
people say this is a bad apologize but I don&#39;t think she is trying to even apologize lol<br>just a way to say she&#39;s fed up?
Girl.
Ooooooooof
girl …. lmao 👎
"You’re human my love, nobody but you and those involved knows the true facts behind everything that happened, its nobodies business. It’s not normal to have a bunch of teenagers constantly messaging you, you reacted in the only way you thought was right at the time, we know your intentions were pure. I’m sorry this has happened, i’m sorry you are being bullied, you still have fans that love you. Look after yourself my love ❤"
NO WAY LMAO
LMAO HUH
O.o
"Please everyone think before you say things as it&#39;s so easy to jump to conclusions.<br>Even if she made mistakes she isn&#39;t the same person she is now.<br>Don&#39;t hold things against her because she made fart jokes.<br>Overall just please be kind ♥"
Non of this seemed genuine at all
girl ikyfl
<b>Lmao get bent</b>
<b>honestly thought this was kinda genius. why people hate for no reason.</b> 😅
this was odd...
GIRL BE FFR!!
What woow
I love you so much colleen this storm shall pass and I hope you are doing okay! Don&#39;t let this get you down and spend some time with family and friends! It&#39;s gonna be okay!
"Colleen! I genuinely hope you read this because you were such an amazing person and unfortunately in the day and age we live in now people are insecure and get bored and like to pray on peoples downfalls and bring up past events just for an ounce of entertainment. You truly do not deserve any of the hate you’re receiving, please continue to keep your head up and stand up for what you think is right! My friends and I love you and look up to you so much! We will always support you❤️"
Im still here colleen ❤️
“They diddnnnntt sayyyy I couldn’t singggggg!”
You actually have my respect for not turning off the comments
This is awesome.
Ok regardless of the real intentions behind this video…the song is good and she is very talented. We can’t deny that
this is fye bro🔥🔥 cant wait for the next track! 🫶🏽
"I LOVE YOU COLLEEN! Everyone makes mistakes, you’re just on the internet where the whole world can judge you. You matter and you’ve helped many people, including me. Keep going 🤍"
still a catchy lil tune that is stuck in my head for the last 3 months and happy to say I know all the words!!
Is this dropping on Spotify???
Im happy to see your face Colleen! I will forever be a fan
SLAY 💅🏽
What a banger
I love you!! I love you!! I love you!! I miss your vlogs!! Be safe and keep healing!!
Love and miss you! People act like they’ve never made mistakes in their lives.  I’ve been so amazed by how you call yourself out and own any mistakes you believe you’ve made even when none appear to be present.  Constantly learning and growing. Please show yourself the grace you so often show for other people.  I have always and will always cheer you on!
I love you so much Colleen! Keep on going because you are so much better than the things that are being said abt you
Also stop hating on her she will post another video just wait
"i’m on your side colleen, please don’t feel like you’re going through this alone cuz you’re not💕💕hope you’re doing well"
Anyone here in December 2023 <br>👇🏻
Is anyone else just tired of cancel culture???
"Can&#39;t cancel Colleen, she&#39;s a genius and wanted to be in touch and cool with her fans. Everyone relax."
if you guys know her she always makes songs to like talk about her emotions i think this was her way of at least saying something until she is allowed to make a sit down video and actually talk about everything in depth
I’m sorry Colleen. I still support you ❤️
points for creativity?
"Few days ago I had no idea who you are but wow, iconic"
Is this on Spotify?
and the song isn’t even good .. girl
My most streamed Spotify song of the year
This is the most random but creative apology ever.
this is a bop
"I don&#39;t really know the story, but that&#39;s a catchy song."
Me realizing that the last day of 2023 is 123123 proof 12/31/23
SHE APOLOGISED AND TOOK ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESE THINGS YEARS AGO!!!! Leave her alone. I support Colleen 100%
I honestly hate to think that people are trying to cancel her. Cancel culture is horrible. There is no way that she is a groomer she has children herself. I dont get it
"I’m with u girl, ur good, we r all people"
Love you Colleen!
On Spotify when
WHEN THE ALBUM??
"I love you Colleen, you are such an amazing soul. people will spread so much about good people. it’s gonna be okay girl. &lt;3"
&quot;HE DIDN&#39;T SAY I COULDN&#39;T SIIINNNNGGGGGG&quot;
The haters who are talking trash …. Who have wantched her for years now have watched her grow … mistakes happen . She’s human and she’s admitting how she feels . She’s a person too just like me and you …and everyone else on the internet …. She’s still an amazing person . In my books . I love you and your content . Your one of the fair actual genuine person . Seems genuine people are rare in 2023 now … i still support you Colleen . Your true fans and friends and family  will always stand by you . *hugs *
"I want to say to everyone here;  I wish you all good things, and overload of LOVE! Give or get a hug today ❤"
i loved this
"Shine on, you’ve got this💗"
I’m here for you!!!❤
I mean the chorus is kind of catchy though
HE DIDNT SAY I COULDNT SINGGG
IS THIS ON SPOTIFY
Love it!❤
SONG OF THE SUMMER JUST DROPPED!! 🔥🔥
Ngl the song is pretty catchy
This is low-key incredible
You are awesome love you Colleen you have inspired me so much 🎉❤❤❤❤❤
I mean...  As cringe as this is. She&#39;s not wrong about cancel culture.
"Colleen,  YouTube is a harsh place to put your life on.  I’ve watched you for years and every day since the start of Covid!  I just want you to remember and know you are loved.  You are going through a very difficult situation and I know from experience in my life that when something you love and something that defines who you are as a person gets ripped from you because of a mistake or rumors or hateful people it can be so overwhelming and feel so awful that you start to question who you are as a person and what is your purpose for being here.  Let me tell you in case you haven’t heard it from anyone but the people closest to you,  you are worthy of forgiveness for your mistakes!  You are worthy of love and not just from those closest to you right now.  You have touched many people and done so much good.  Don’t let other people’s agendas and need for gossip define who you are right now!  Let “them” cancel you!  You don’t exist to make “them” happy!  I feel like from being a part of your life for the past few years that the mistakes made in the past are just that, the past!  I’m still rooting for you and your family and I know I’m not the only one!"
Your voice is so amazing❤️
i cannot believe the things these people are saying colleen has always tried her best to be genuine and authentic even when she was going through shit or happiest ever she has made the choice to always be open  and share her life.. y&#39;all are acting like you have never even said a bad word or shit even dropped a drink on carpet! she&#39;s a human being who makes mistakes and has feelings she is a real person trying to live with her family in this fucked up world(which y&#39;all are quite literally making it worse) what&#39;s the point of taking time out of your day to type a hateful comment ab sb past or mistake they ever made what is the point let&#39;s bsffr what joy does it bring you???!!!?
Colleen I truly LOVE you and I know you might not read this but I hope you know that just cause you made a mistake however many years ago I believe you have tried you’re hardest to redeem yourself
I love you Colleen
Is this on spotify
You need to move on.  Just start. Vloging again .Don&#39;t let them win they are just jealous.   Move on for your kids vlog vlog vlog.
"❤❤❤ I love this! Stay strong, I love you 😢"
"Uhh Colleen, I don’t think this is the best way to respond… I was a fan and now I don’t know if I can still like you"
Yo this is fire 🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️💯💯💯
I’m sorry but she’s right….. I’m not saying what she did is correct or incorrect because I don’t know what is true or untrue but now a days society is so ready to jump and destroy people’s lives with things that happened in the past or mistakes they have made. It’s not fair. People change and make mistakes. It’s not fair to hold it over their head forever
girl keep strong and dont let them rizz your gyat! keep it up! 🥹🥹❤️‍🩹
"To be fair, stan culture was different then. If I was in a groupchat with Dan and Phil and they actually messaged me back in 2016, I would’ve shit my pants. Idk man it seems like it’s just a bunch of young kids who weren’t actually older teens in 2016, they just don’t understand how different the internet was then."
What even happened? 😮
ALL ABOARDDDD
🎶🕺🏼The TOXIC GOSSIP TRAIN ‼️🎶
Say what you want but she can sing
This song is a banger
Genius ❤
Colleen you still have people that love you! Please know that! ❤
So musically… this ate
i’m not giving any type of opinion or picking any sides.. but yall notice everybody getting “canceled” is from the same era of the internet? 😐
this made me giggle
Can’t imagine the people that don’t listen to you! You are shining!
I absolutely loved this.
why am i living lowkey
this song is lowkey fire tho
"For what it&#39;s worth Colleen, people who&#39;ve watched and loved you consistently for years will see that this is how you genuinely get your feelings out safely-you use music!! You always have! And anyone who has watched you consistently for years knows your heart, because you wear it on your sleeve. I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;ve been misinterpreted to a new generation. I hope you&#39;re able to get some pockets of peace soon."
"Colleen, I’m sorry you have to go through this nonsense.   😓<br>I still love you Colleen.  ❤<br>This all so ridiculous.  <br>I’m confused."
This on Spotify?
"If what she did was sooo terrible, then why have charges not been filed against her?  It&#39;s been, what, five years since this happened?  There has been PLENTY of time to get her in court.  That has not happened, why?  There is nothing here.  You think you have all this evidence with screenshots. There are two sides to a story.  Quit judging her without knowing all the facts.  Does she deserve to lose her job over this?  If so, why didn&#39;t that happen 3 to 5 years ago?  Why now???"
I love this 😂😂
"things will get better ❤, people make mistakes, &amp; sometimes things go over ppls heads , thanks for doing this"
Points for creativity
this is fucking great lol!
"People complaining this is not an apology, dude she did it 3 years ago..."
"I mean to be fair she did already apologize years ago. It just saddens me to see how people are so quick to attack when no one knows the full story or intentions of anyone. I just think, she has 3 beautiful babies at home that are probably sensing something is wrong with their momma. Everyone has a life outside of social media guys. Most of us don&#39;t even know the half of it."
You are an amazing person and please dont let these fucking no lifes ruin your life with something they dont know about you are an amazing person and made my childhood Amazing 🥰😍😍
You have been missed and are loved! ❤
Only seeing this although checking in frequently.<br>You are light! Be you ❤️
My prayers go out to you and the family Colleen 🙏
i just want to know how Applesauce is doing 🐔🥚🎭
Hi
GIRLSJDKDH
HE DIDNT SAYYY I COULDNT SINGGGG
This was perfect.
Stay strong ❤❤❤ You are a human at the end of the day and are allowed to grow
I love you Colleen! Hope you&#39;re well ❤️
THEYYYY DIDNT SAY I COULDNT SIIIING
No cuz why is the song actually fire💀😭
"Hear me out, she does make some good points. Nothing really to help her case because she never apologizes. And yes I know singing this song was probably the worst decision she made. but in the lyrics she does make some good points."
ok but the song kinda slapped.
Stay strong Colleen! I know you wont let them fanum tax your gyatt and ohio rizz you ❤
Don’t let the haters be Ohio rizz to you. Stay strong and keep going ❤
Iconic I love it
"Even if she does apologize, y&#39;all would still be on her ass just like a dozen other content creators out there who have tried to perfect and protect their image by &quot;taking accountability&quot; when in actuality you want them off the internet for good. don&#39;t try to play nice smh 😑"
My hero! Thank you for the song!
I’m so sorry you are going through this. We are all human and unfortunately you can’t take back what you did in the past.  These people have worse things they did and are trying to make themselves feel better by ruining someone’s life they don’t even know. Anyway happy to see you but sad for the reason❤
Yess collen! ❤
what
Such a banger
"yes girl. sending love your way, so happy to see your face 💕 please know you have so many adults out here seeing you and wishing you and your little family well."
Damn ok
y’all are weak i stg. this happened how long ago?? the fucking internet is a crazy place frfr y’all bashing on her isnt gonna do anything lmao keep doin u colleen. we &lt;3 u
BANGER ALERT!
Not gonna lie she sing better that the most singer i know
DELIVEREDDD VOCALS ❤❤
Low key a bop
Is this an ITYSL sketch?
PERIOD
Stay strong Colleen! We&#39;re here for you ❤
Stay strong and keep your head up high ❤
So glad to see you!!!  I have missed your vlogs!!! Praying for you!!! ❤
"This is tragic on both sides. Fans who got hurt and a performer who was monetized on YouTube and sold tickets with all these stage performances recorded and never said anything about it until now and the very thing ppl were entertained by is now evidence against them.. what does that make ppl who paid to  watch it, volunteered to be on stage? The whole thing is twisted on every side and sad and even worse forever connected to her name for her kids to see later.  Humans are a complicated creature and fame is fickle..  u can be entertainment until later its decided its perverse... I hope everyone can find healing on both sides eventually"
Yooooo she got bars tho!!! let’s gooooooo
"I haven&#39;t watched the video yet, but she has already spoken about this YEARS ago. Somehow, it resurfaced. Leave the poor lady alone. She&#39;s a great mom and is thriving."
Number 1 billboard coming
"Haters gonna hate and people gonna judge but lettt them girlll, if you guys don&#39;t want to se colleen then unsubscribe because I won&#39;t. We love you Colleen I understand there&#39;s small minded people out there living only to bring others down like they are perfect <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23get"">#get</a> a life , <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23loveyoucolleen"">#loveyouColleen</a>❤️"
🎵the toxic gossip train 🎵
"No cap, Im a little drunk and I could cry right now"
loved it. love you. miss you and your family so much!! ready for your regular content again
All I want to say is… all I NEED to say is….. 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗 I miss you
Loved you forever and always will!! you are 100% right
"This was genius. I love you, and I hope your vlogs come back soon ❤"
"Omg. Just leave her alone. No one needs thousands of people saying the same negative stuff about them. No human can handle this amount of hate. Let it go and mind your own business. She has three innocent children to be a mother to, and your words are not helping. She didn&#39;t commit a crime; otherwise, she would be convicted of one, but you all act like she raped or killed young children. Im not a Colleen super fan and I&#39;m not invested in this, but I&#39;m old enough to know that all this hate will just break Colleen and her family will be greatly impacted. If you Don&#39;t like her, unfollow her and take your negativity else where."
this made me cry
LMAOOOO
her vocals are actually very nice
"Although this might not be the best way to come back and apologize, if you actually listen to what she’s saying. She is saying sorry and she is apologizing. And although this is a little strange, and I don’t fully understand the situation. I feel like she went into detail and is actually trying to apologize and tell the truth. Y’all will just ignore and make jokes and not actually listen to her, and then call her out for being a bad person. Maybe listen, you might actually see that she is trying."
"Colleen, you’re a real person and this whole thing is such a non-issue for so many of us. I wouldn’t even address it at this point if I were you. You’re beyond all of this. You may lose a few followers in the short term. Let ‘em go. Your talent will give you new ones to replace them. So. Please stop all this nonsense - it’s beneath you to participate. I can’t wait for your next “normal” video… please don’t make us wait too long :) Saw you in St Albert with my niece and sister. We loved it. Your show is fantastic"
"I miss you. I know you&#39;re not doing well right now. Nobody would be thriving in your shoes. What you&#39;re going through is difficult AF. I feel like you probably aren&#39;t reading comments anymore because the hate really overpowers everything else right now, but I did want to break up some of the hate and judgement with positivity. I wonder if this pain is motivating you to be more creative, I know that&#39;s what happens to me. To me, you singing with your uke is genuine and very creative - you turned your pain into art. I don&#39;t like your lyric about you not surviving the crash though... you will survive this. It won&#39;t be easy, but you will survive this!<br><br>You are surviving this."
I was here before everyone else was.
"Alright, I personally think this was very well said. I do think that some specific addressing needs to be done but her message about taking the proof and receipts and adding to them to gain more views and ruin her reputation was LOUD and CLEAR. Also why does everything need to be shown on this platform?: To gain more views… it’s disgusting and unnecessary to have this drama out for the whole world to see."
😂😂😂😂
"I honestly feel bad because we all know whatever she dose to make up for it, it will never be enough for you guys I honestly believe her. She’s a human we all make mistakes even if they really really bad!! She only human after all let her live."
SUCH A BOP
Can everyone stop pretending they would forgive her if she did her video any other 9 ways she could have. 😂
"Well, she is undeniably talented..."
Oh Colleen :s
I love you Colleen!!! Hang in there ❤
You look annoyed angry and frustrated and I enjoyed watching that immensely. Good on you girl!  👍🏻😁 I like seeing this side of you.
"Everyone needs to sit down and take a second. If she would have sat there and made like a 25min video apologizing, you guys would call her a liar, say you don&#39;t care and say &quot;she&#39;s only responding because she got caught&quot;. If she never responded, you guys would say she&#39;s guilty. If she completely stuck up for herself, you guys would also say she&#39;s a liar and say that you&#39;ve already seen the facts. So now she gives you a response, not meant as an apology, just kind of saying &quot;don&#39;t believe everything you see&quot; because guess what, there&#39;s two sides to everything. I have been a fan for years, and yes what I have seen is really sickening and it makes me really sad, but I&#39;m not going to bash her before I&#39;ve even heard her side. This whole cancel culture shit is really fucking annoying, I swear people aren&#39;t even fans of her and are bashing on her. Chill tf out."
Please don’t stop your videos!!!😭
I liked your song ❤
Kinda legendary
ok
I don&#39;t like this mob mentality and ruining someone&#39;s life based on gossip. It&#39;s disgusting how weak and stupid the younger generation has become.
This is brilliant!
"Colleen, you&#39;re amazing. Sorry, you&#39;re going through this. The way you&#39;re responding to this nonsense has us (the fam) loving you all the more."
"I love you and your whole family, and I miss your videos! I&#39;m sorry for what you are going through, sorry. God bless you."
Just wow!!!😮
Ok but at least she said sorry
"colleen, I’m so sorry this happened to u. You don’t deserve this whatsoever. I love you girly stay strong❤."
Guess what everyone. It wouldn&#39;t have mattered how or what she said. It wouldn&#39;t have mattered if she apologized the way you or anyone else wanted. Shes absolutely correct. No one is going to care what she has to say. They wont believe it anyway. So why not do it however she damn well pleases
"Seems like people forget there are two sides to every story...<br>Whether you have a platform or not, NO ONE deserves the amount of hate both sides have received. <br>People can heal from trauma privately instead of making it the entire internet&#39;s business. Getting revenge &amp; trying to tear someone&#39;s life &amp; reputation apart from someone who hurt you DOESN&#39;T provide long term healing. Instant gratification, yes. But not healing. <br>If you&#39;ve suffered from any sort of trauma &amp; expect everyone to feel for you, yet you turn around &amp; hurt the person who hurt you back, you are just as guilty of the person who caused you harm. <br>Everyone is responsible for their own healing. <br>And everyone deserves to move on &amp; gain healing.<br>Leave Colleen alone.<br>Leave those affected by Colleen&#39;s mistakes alone.<br>Stick around for her content, or leave if she upsets you.<br>Just quit spreading hate.<br>And actually have the strength to walk away from what brings you down instead of arming yourselves with pitchforks.<br>Whether you&#39;ve made horrible mistakes or not, you deserve healing.<br>And you deserve peace. <br>But no one can give you peace.<br>That&#39;s YOUR responsibility. <br>Not anyone else&#39;s."
love u colleennnn
Girl let the haters back off please make more vlogs you make my day so much better watching your videos. I have pretty much all your videos. I hope you are doing okay you made mistakes but we are all human.
Iconic.
I’m so glad to see your beautiful face. I’ve missed you❤❤❤
ok why this lowkey ate…
"Please ignore all the bullshit and come back to YouTube , I miss watching you daily. 😢"
People saying this the worst apology this rlly isn’t an apology this is her explaining her point of view….
It says PG-13 on the website - so true what you are saying!
What do you guys want?! She literally said she didn&#39;t have any bad intentions!!! Come on she is a mother of 3...you are all ridiculous ppl behind a screen!!
You rock ❤
"this is the most disappointing comment section I&#39;ve ever seen lol y&#39;all gotta get outta here. internet culture is so weird. she&#39;s responding the only way she knows how, singing. Singing is her thing. Y&#39;all would&#39;ve said these things not matter how she resonded."
"I vote this the BEST APOLOGY VIDEO of all time, this is a future Youtube CLASSIC in real time... <br>But i&#39;m a sucker for musicals and i don&#39;t know what the fuck happened or care to find out beyond this video"
"Having just heard of her and not looking at all into the allegations, she sounds pretty reasonable.. sure, it&#39;s snarky and a non apology, but she&#39;s right.. cancel culture is BS.  Defining someone entirely by a mistake they made.. BUT cancel culture s the reality, so you have to deal with it."
"💖This is great! I was never a fan of Colleen but I&#39;m so glad Colleen made this video, it&#39;s perfect! Well done, for calling out the toxicity of all these chronically online bored people!"
"No one is perfect, we all make mistakes. You aren&#39;t evil for making mistakes, even really bad mistakes. Being 20, 25, 30 doesn&#39;t make you immune to mistakes."
YOOO THIS IS COLD DROP THIS ON STREAMING SERVICES
Best video of 2023
Love you Colleen. F the haterz
y’all fr needa hop off her back. She was just trying to be a good person.. like grow up and quit spreading bs lies. I’ve followed colleen for a good 7 years and she’s has been nothing but kind. So hop off her back and worry about your own damn problems
"I don’t understand why you are receiving backlash for posting this. Why people feel this wasn’t enough. I don’t understand why there is so much toxicity and hate. Anyone who really knows you would know you would never do the things they accuse you of doing. No matter what know there are those who stood by you and will continue to stand with you no matter what. Hate will not prevail! Thank you for posting this! Know that this will only solidify who you are as a person not define you, this will strengthen you and lead you forward. You got this Colleen!!! We love and support you!!!<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23stopthehate"">#Stopthehate</a>"
"There’s be little to no internet drama for so long, sorry you had to be the one that had to feed peoples desire for toxicity"
❤❤❤❤❤ You can survive this! You will survive this!! Context is everything. I missed you. Ignore the hate. It will disappear eventually. Ive missed your videos.
"BRAVA, BEAUTIFUL SOUL! I am sorry for the torment you are experiencing. <br><br>There are those who will never truly understand how harmful throwing horrible words like “p€%@“ around and others will suffer due to this. <br><br>Miranda is a character based on humor of the 90s and if people don’t understand her, that’s on them. Personally, it’s a genius character and I hope to see you on stage soon. <br><br>Thank you for this perfect reply. I look forward to seeing you vlog every day again. 💜"
I support you.❤️
Kinda iconic tho
I think you have addressed this and should just go back to doing your normal content now like nothing happened.   Don&#39;t read the comments.  The people who will watch will watch and eventually the attacks will subside.  There is no accountability that would be enough for the people who are angry.
Awe Colleen!! This is so sweet! I’m not sure what the rumors are exactly but keep your head high!
"look, fan from the get go, and always will be a fan,  I would personally would like to extend my friendship to you, really wish these things didn&#39;t happen, but it does, believe me when I say you will recover cause the reality is that you and all of us are human, this too shall pass. love you chica."
I’m sorry but this was gold
youn need to rrealease this song 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍love the runs
Ngl this kinda fire 🔥
I still love this song 🎶
your awesome
Incredibly disappointed in you. You had us all fooled that you were a good person. I guess this proves you are not. Sad.
This is very Colleen
Love this
"Ok I’m done. Leave Colleen alone. Everyone in entitled to their own opinions, I get that. Her Miranda character is supposed to make strange comments..THATS HER JOB. Her content is for adults. Anyways, the rumors are sad..if the rumors that are being spread didn’t come from her or you don’t have concrete proof that she did ANY of that..I’m with her. I have been watching Colleen for almost 4 years. So stop holding her to her past. NOBODY IS PERFECT. How would you like it if someone were to go and TEAR apart your past. Colleen, I am so sorry for these rumors that are not even being told as the truth. I truly love you and your content. Some people..aren’t meant for your content. I love you ❤️"
I mean song kinda slaps though
"These comments my god. Listen to her, it would be so easy to just say sorry and let it all blow over but she’s sticking to her truth and being strong in the path that she never did anything intentionally to hurt anyone. People are so mean and run with anything they hear, also that was then and this is now obviously we have ALL grown to know what is right and what is wrong. Back then so many things were accepted that aren’t now but we still drag things up from the past for absolutely no reason? These are real people with feelings in a messy situation it’s none of our business to determine who’s right and who’s wrong in this, they all need to move on and heal."
Hi<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Hi
Love u and miss u!
Not bad song though
I support you 100% Colleen!!!! I hope people will get past all these lies and things you &quot;did&quot; in the past and you can start posting again! This video made me want to cry with how hurt I know you feel. You are a comedian and make jokes. if there was a problem with a joke that was made in the past maybe people could of said something then instead of now with all the made up crap.
So glad to see you hopefully back! I completely have your back. I’ll be sending you a letter and some gifts for you and your kids soon. Love you and I’ve been praying for you every night. 💜💕🦋
She’s got some good points though…
I can see how hurt you are through this song - there is always three sides to every story - i have loved watching you and your family thankyou for sharing your life thus far
i love you
This made me cry
the song kinda slaps tho ngl…
"Oh girl, I just wanna hug you so bad right now.. stay strong 🤍🤍"
Y’all are so dramatic she’s not any of those bad things. LOVE HER
Love you Colleen.
It is sad how everything she’s worked for her life is crumbling down. People make mistakes and it sad that some are publicized
"Toxic Gossip Train, sounds Great.   Hope all is great."
"I genuinely do not understand why y’all are so angry at her? Humor (in her own way) is literally how she handles bad things?? Have y’all learned nothing over the past 15 years of seeing her??? I don’t get it, she’s very visibly hurt and trying to cope with it. Get over yourself"
She’s made an apology video years ago for all of this stuff. Why is it all coming to the forefront again? I applaud her for taking another route. Sure it’s cheesy but at least it’s something different.
😀
iconic
"i think she got her punishment for what people are saying. her career, as it was, is over.  we don&#39;t need to bully her into su*cidal thoughts. that is not right. just unsubscribe, stop watching and stop supporting if you really don&#39;t want her on youtube."
Love You! ❤
🫶🏻🫶🏻youre human queen
"Just wanted to let you know that the whole internet might be in rage about this song and the whole situation but you are still someone I look up to as a strong af and truly loving momma. I followed your vlogs for the past two years while I became a Mom myself, Never really commenting but now I felt the need to… because everyone deserves love and support as a human being and you might have screwed up in your online past but you do so much in your personal Life for your children and Family and that‘s worth so much if Not even more. You might not be welcomed back in the online community for a while but I wish you only the best and all the love from your close Family and friends and you as a Human being are okay Just the way you are - with all your flaws and mistakes. Cause let‘s Not forget: we‘ve all got them. Difference is, ours are not presented and talked about all around the world… best wishes and cuddle the kiddos - M. ❤"
i mean.. it’s catchy ig…
Colleen hasn’t used her music because she is trying not be disrespectful if you have watched her it’s how she gets her feelings out through her music! I’m so sorry people have a past but the only thing different between you and her is you don’t film your entire life so people can’t point out everything you did wrong!!!
"Don&#39;t get me wrong, she kinda ate the song HEAVY on kinda but I&#39;m not gonna say nothing bad. I&#39;m not like that"
Y’all aren’t listening to a word of this and it shows
"I will admit my bias because I’ve been watching Colleens YouTube videos for almost 6 years now for context I never really liked Miranda Sings. I’ve frankly never watched Miranda sings content unless it was for Colleen because I liked Colleen. I always loved their family’s channels and I watched Rachel, Colleen, and sometimes Chris. The whole Ballinger family that’s what I grew up with. Only recently had I started watching Colleens Vlogs less consistently Because I’ve been busy with college. However, when all of this came out about Colleen a few years ago, I remember believing the person that said it and when Colleen originally addressed it everyone universally came to the understanding that she had made a mistake. The irony is all of this drama that’s coming back up is it is the same thing that people tried to cancel her with years ago. Now, by no means, am I trying to justify any of her actions, but what I’m saying is for this video specifically, I appreciated the apology. I have grown up, feeling like I’ve known Colleen and known her personality, and she always turns to art when she doesn’t know how else to express herself. that’s some thing I quite liked about her because I end up doing the same thing in my personal life. The point I’m trying to make here is this apology is perfect for her in my opinion because this is an example of who Colleen is and how she deals with problems. I think it’s beautiful frankly, when an artist pours their heart into their work. I know some are saying that they would prefer for her to have been more professional in this video, but contrary to popular belief, when all of this came up years ago, she did address all of this and made a formal apology years ago. So now when people are bringing up the past again and trying to cancel her with the same old thing, I think this is a perfect way to respond and I understand if you disagree that’s all right. I could be wrong, and I could be blinded by my own nostalgia but it’s my opinion. Colleen if you happen to see this comment, just know that one of your fans has forgiven you, and still loves you.❤<br><br><br>Also, just bring a little bit more perspective into this. I really don’t appreciate you guys calling her a pedophile because I am a sexual assault victim. I was raped by a 30 year old man when I was six years old he was a pedophile. Colleen making a few out of taste jokes and weird comments does not make her a pedophile. Please don’t label people with such horrific terms when they haven’t done anything to deserve it."
points for creativity
why is this kind of a bop
I love you COLLEEEN💓 stay strong
Haters back off 👄
What do y’all want from this woman? She said she made a mistake😂 Honestly though what do y’all want her to do?
"Colleen I hope you’re doing ok. Just know you do have people out there who still want the best for you. You have made me laugh for years, gave me happiness as a depressed tween with no friends, helped others in their journeys to stardom, are accepting of the loser kids and gay kids and weird theater and art kids, outcasted kids, poured your heart into your work, prioritized your fans over your own health many times, you’re talented, and seemingly a wonderful mother, sister, daughter and wife. The way people have berated you, threatened you, and body shammed you over this is so vile and toxic. If the goal for this was accountability, all of those other things didn’t have to happen. This was a smear campaign. I don’t argue with there being inappropriate jokes made, I don’t want to diminish other people feelings about their experiences. This whole situation to me has been more about hurting and humiliating you and tearing apart your character with irreversible allegations that aren’t always presented in a truthful way. Calling someone’s groomer is a very serious and legally punishable thing and implies sexual abuse/relationships or other illegal activity with underage people. It’s not just talking to, joking, interacting with and being friendly with young people or every celebrity, Daily vlogger, YouTuber, Tiktoker, influencer would be considered a groomer. The YouTube community was really just beginning in 2012 and most of these YouTubers we know now had ever had experience on the platform or even much with the internet/social media altogether. MySpace was the first real “social media” and it was very common for larger accounts to communicate with ‘fans’ of all ages in groups and messages and pen pals with younger people like an older/younger sister type relationship. That was how this generation of YouTubers grew up on the internet. Having boundaries with internet followers wasn’t something they knew they needed until they blew up enough that they had probably already crossed the boundaries most have in place today. How are you supposed to know the limitations as an internet famous person if no one had ever been internet famous before? The jokes Colleen/Miranda have made are sometimes inappropriate or even bad taste but never with ill intent never with the intention to coerce, manipulate, or groom."
Honestly preach
"Colleen I know you wouldn’t see this but I wanted to spread some love with all this hate your getting. I believe you and understand what your saying. Your admitting to the things you have done and have admitted you didn’t think what you were doing was wrong at the time. No body is perfect and everyone is just trying in this world. You just wanted people/ your fans to like you and didn’t know the right way to go about it at the time. You were young and made mistakes we all do. Everyone who attends your shows and watch’s your videos need to understand what they are getting themselves into you have always made it clear what they are about and that it is inappropriate and all jokes. <br><br>I just want you to know that I support you,  love you and have missed seeing your videos because I think of you as my friend. I wish you all the best and hope you can still see the positive messages you are getting through the hate ❤❤❤"
kinda a jam tho
Fire song ngl
"So your telling me, she has been online for 15+ years and all the sudden these things start coming up? I mean ok believe what you want"
"Ya’ll can’t be mad that she didn’t apologize when you’d just make fun of her for that too. I don’t think you REALIZE how much things like this can ruin a persons life in almost every aspect. I’ve been a fan of Colleen’s for almost 10 years and have even met her. She’s genuinely the sweetest human I have ever met. She agreed that what she did in the past was weird and you have to keep in mind that she was very young herself when she started Miranda Sings. She has grown so much and learned so much, as we all do. Please think about how this is affecting her and her mental health. She has said all that she feels she wanted to or could to defend herself, it’s not right to make fun of her for defending herself. She’s not just some youtuber that everyone wants off the internet. She’s a wife and mother. Think not only about her, but her family."
"I mean... Tbh... I don&#39;t know much about the situation, but everything she says here seems extremely genuine. That&#39;s just my take on it. It seems like everyone is just shitting on her for just doing this in music form, when in reality, it&#39;s much mote genuine than 90% of any Youtuber&#39;s apology/explanation video."
Look y’all need to calm down 😂😂😂
"Not me in my head playing that office gif of Michael screaming “omg it’s happening, everybody calm down. CALM TF DOWN!!” 😂 But you have no idea how EXCITED I AM TO SEE AND HEAR YOUR VOICE QUEEN. It’s like that feeling when your friend has been grounded for 3 weeks and then they finally get to come back out and hang out with you again. Everything in your song is what your army has been saying all along. We love ya weird auntie, bff, cousin, sister, all the things you are to us 💞 Also, the ending literally made me throw my head back and cackle laugh. ILYSM ❤️‍🩹"
Guys YN she is a comedian it’s her job to make videos like this and try r thing with her sending stuff to fans she’s a comedian and like tf is she supposed to do idc what the internet is we’re all humans and if she did do bad stuff it’s in the future everyone makes mistakes and although people make bigger ones It’s sad to think of people who see her that way bc I still love Colleen
I’m kinda half and half on if Colleen allegations are real but one thing I do want to say is why didn’t she post this video on her main channel this channel has been like her safe place and she just introduced it to almost all of her haters and doesn’t she want more people to like know her opinion on this matter
thank you so much you are so brave
hello
Wow
I will say:<br><br>We don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening behind closed doors. We don&#39;t know how things played out. All we can do is trust our instincts that there are trustworthy people out there
It&#39;s sad that some people feel they need to put others down in order to get ahead. You are a kind and generous person Coleen. I enjoy watching your videos and seeing your beautiful family. Wishing you love and strength during this difficult time.
There have been some terrible comments on your video but just know your fans love you!❤
Honestly best response ever
"I know you guys are all against this style of apology video but honestly I like the unique take lol. She’s not entirely wrong with what she says in this..but yeah she was a loser with zero boundaries, let the women live jeez"
hi i guess
QUEEN
I would of made a video like this too. None of them really know you they can think what they want but only you know the truth there are real problems in the world and gossip is what their worried about don’t let them tear you down BACK OFF HATERS!!
Hahah this is awesome
Been thinking of you 🤍
"Idk…. I remember when she spoke about this somewhere a few years back, I like her attitude 🤷‍♀️"
nice song
Could&#39;ve just said this without the ukulele and singing...
"Jeez, all these people commenting, get over yourselves , leave her alone 🤍"
You obviously care a lot.
Yayyy!! She’s back
I&#39;ve been watching colleen and stopped but still sometimes watched her videos but if you people actually watched colleen and Miranda yall would know colleen anit like that cause now the Genz is so sensitive and snowflakes because 1 person did a mistake and all these things were back then in the 2010&#39;s and the humor and status were different then like people could take jokes and the thing with Adam if u watched the stream he SPECIFICALLY asked for the panties because she was unboxing random things and was giving it away and with the girl who was &quot;exposed&quot; on stage she wanted to get called up for the corn challenge but got called up for yoga and she could&#39;ve denied it and didn&#39;t go up but she did so its basically her fault for going on stage knowing her outfit was revealing and with the kid and cheeseballs he could&#39;ve said he didn&#39;t but that was all an innocent act u can hear the parents and children laughing in the crowd so all this is absolutely bogus because when something comes out and you realize colleen was right and innocent yall gonna look real dumb and if those people were victim&#39;s I&#39;m sorry but everyone should not be jumping on colleen like this cause yall loved her and now all of sudden hate her make it make sense because if you were a fan you&#39;d defend her and not accuse her so what is this like all these people are so invested in someone else&#39;s life and making a big deal out of it and now that technology is advanced there&#39;s things that can be fake and generated so yall shouldn&#39;t be riding colleen like its the toxic gossip train so yall really need to calm down with all this she made an apology and you guys are upset about it this is wildddd
YES COLLEEN I LOVE YOU FOR THIS I LITERALLY LOVE YOU SO MUCH MAN
I&#39;ve seen you grow and go to therapy and try to be a better person for the past few years and I wonder what people are really waiting for. Feels like they just want the end of your career and nothing else will satisfy them. I stand by you.
👑
🥴
Slayy
..she kinda right
Your family is what&#39;s most important 🩷
This is kind of catchy
I wish I could give you a big hug right now. :(
your not wrong
IDC YOU SLAYEDT
"None of you actually know her as a person, and only listen to what lies are going on online"
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"I reckon just go back to posting vlogs, those that will be there will be there."
I hate cancel culture so much😩 she’s corny but she’s not a bad person… i don’t understand why people today feel so entitled and feel like the world owes them something. Every vid that came out about her was such a fucking reach.
Missed you so much. I love you Colleen.🫶🏼
Seriously NOT a loser! And definitely NOT a groomer!
I love you
Stay strong queen. We know who you are. You will get through these lies. Love you so much ❤️❤️
They’re things wrong that’s happened. Say sorry. You really need to say sorry. No your not a horrible person. You’re an awesome person actually
dont worry colleen this happened to Haley Bieber and now everyone is in her comments saying they love her after bullying her relentlessly just wait for the light at the end of the tunnel ❤❤
"Colleen I’m so sorry this is happening to you,you are a beautiful wife,incredible mother and these are the things l see,bless you,🙏❤️🙏❤️"
"I completely unrelated to what was going on remembered watching Miranda sings and your personal blogs back around 2015 and I remembered how much your content made my loser days a little bit better dealing with the hell hole that was public middle school. Thank you for sharing your life and thoughts online, it made me feel less alone then and it does now. We carry on with our heads up ❤"
Everyone is just picking this apart without actually listening and thinking about what was said. Which kind of is her whole point with the video. People want to pick apart every little thing and not actually put things in perspective. She did admit her mistakes and feels awful about it. But people only want to see the bad and can’t look through one side of things
"everyone&#39;s making fun of her for &quot;singing an apology&quot;.. but honestly, if you just read the lyrics as it is, it makes lotsa sense.<br>.<br>all i can say is.. who am i to judge 😳"
"Colleen, it will pass, you just have to wait"
I miss you. You are a positive vibe
I love the song
"I love that this is her response. People are blowing this out of proportion. Enough with cancel culture! She apologized years ago… get the fuck over it! <br>There are real criminals out there and you are canceling a woman who apologized for this in the past, supports kids with cancer every year on her birthday, makes lighthearted videos about her sweet family. Give me a break! Y’all need therapy."
"I&#39;m trying to understand this timeline of events...<br>Three years ago she was accused of inappropriate contact with underage fans. One in particular came out and made a video. She took accountability and apologized for her inappropriate choices and has grown and changed since then. <br>Meanwhile the person who made a video was doxed, bullied and harassed.<br>Now more corroborating evidence about her inappropriate contact has come to light and people want her to apologize again? I don&#39;t understand that. She has already apologized. If anything it&#39;s the people who bullied that one person who came out with the allegations that should apologize. <br><br>I think that maybe singing this wasn&#39;t the best move, but she is a human and people are emotional and flawed and that&#39;s kinda ok. I don&#39;t know what glowing saint person you want to see on here, but I always felt like she was honest about her missteps and mistakes and took strides to learn from them.<br><br>I&#39;m 40 and it would kill me if people still judged me based on who I was 15 years ago. Anyways. That&#39;s my two cents."
"I am so sorry Colleen you are going through this. It must be really hard. You are a mom, a wife, a sister, a daughter, a niece, etc. At the end of the day we all mean well. There&#39;s so much stuff and I really hope one day you vlog. I have always enjoyed seeing your videos and vlog about your life."
Haha. the Internet is so cool.
"what she’s saying low key makes sense, y’all don’t want her to apologize you want her off the internet for good, and probably wouldn’t be happy unless she was put in jail. any apology she could make wouldn’t satisfy people. Glancing at you @penguinz0 ."
"You guys don&#39;t understand, she took accountability... in private. Which explains why the fans that called her out with screenshots, powerpoint presentations, video clips, written accounts with a timeline ... never referenced this &#39;accountability&#39;. Because it was in private.<br><br>I bet you all feel silly. Not silly enough to go against your managing team that apparently told Colleen to not respond at all [wonder why that is]. And certainly not silly enough to pick up a uke and construct a song that seems more practiced than an apology directly to the people who brought this to light to begin with.<br><br>I bet you all feel very silly."
You are a star ⭐️ and you shine ✨ as bright as day
"colleen, i have been watching you for 10 years and i have not been on social media for the past 5 years (other than youtube) because i just realized that life can be lived without it. i have seen a lot of what has been said on youtube, and to me  i completely understand that you did not recognize in the moment that you were crossing boundaries because you really do make your viewers feel like we are your friend and that is what we love you for. i can also see that you recognize now that it was doing harm to some and you want to make it right. just regardless of what is happening on the internet, remember that in the end you are a great person and have an amazing family who love and support you, and your kids have an amazing mom that they are looking up to. love you girl 🫶🏼"
This just looks like a mental breakdown to me imagine having millions of people express their opinion on you on a daily basis it’s going to get to you which it clearly has her
"Even if all the gossip were true, you&#39;re still not a bad person and deserve some basic respect. I feel so bad for all of the unwarranted distain aimed your way. Hang in there, I hope you have some support around you, you will always have me as a fan at least."
"I pray you are not in agony right now, because we all know how hard you take things and how much you overthink. There are still people out here who love you Colleen. I&#39;m praying for you and your family. Everything will come out in the wash. Stay strong and please eat something ❤"
and don&#39;t forget nothing is all white or all black... and this is true for everybody
❤️ 💕 💗
obsessed!!!!!!!!
WE LOVE YOU ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤Hope Youre okay ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yes! Get MAD!! More people love you than hate you! ❤ F*** the trolls!!!
"She is completely true, people have made rumours about stuff she has done. Yes, she has made mistakes, but that was in her past, we all have made mistakes in our past. Being mean and saying things that are not nice will not fix anything. She has children now, she would never do anything like that, stop making up lies. If you believe those lies and don’t like what she ‘did’. Then leave. She is trying to make videos doing what she currently loves, we know her intention, she is simply trying to make us happy. Showing us her lives, her kids growing up, giggling, laughing, singing, living her life. Just because she is famous does not mean people should be angry at her. If you haven’t made a mistake on your life then there must be something wrong with you. And if you made a mistake years ago, how would you feel to have millions of people going after you, saying mean things, making up lies. Be real people, think how you would feel and start being real! Now if you don’t like Colleen anymore, leave. That is fine with her I am sure, probably better. Go."
This is genuinely a good song tho😂
this is so slay
Since I’m with God I’ma forgive u💕
❤ hi
Thank you Colleen I have never seen anyone handle this cancel culture with more honesty and grace you are an inspiration ❤
"Seeing your face on my feed today just made my little girl&#39;s entire summer. We love and miss you so much, Colleen. <br>Stay strong!"
I LOVE YOU ❤
I missed you Colleen 🫶🏽
❤❤❤
"All this hate is so unnecessary, i hate this woke generation."
she has apologized multiple times and you guys aren’t satisfied so this is the best she can do to satisfy all parties. Love you Colleen stay strong 🫶🫶🫶
Always take your time!
I love you so much. ❤
Why’d everyone just start coming at her 😪 but I love her singing voice tho it’s actually good 😺
always will love you
you ate this girl ❤
"People, are you serious! This is something that happened years ago when she was just learning about the YouTube world. I don’t personally know Colleen but I feel like I have been her best friend for years. everyone learns, grows, and MATURES over time why are y’all trying to hold this over her head so hard. If anyone has ever really watched her videos and paid attention to the kind, sweet, loving, caring personality that shines from her beautiful soul y’all would see and understand that yeah she made a mistake years ago but is not that person anymore you will see and understand that she has grown so much and only says and does with the best intentions to her knowledge. No matter what kind of hate your getting online Colleen, your true fans, like me, will always be on your side to lift you up when needed. Love you and your amazing family! ❤"
I hope ur doin good Collen 💕 i literally love Miranda and i hope she comes back soon 💕
Test
Where are the lyrics?
"You guys are all so fucking brutal. She made MANY mistakes. She was inappropriate, but I believe in my heart she didn’t try to groom children. Like it’s a stretch. She’s unwell clearly; and y’all wanna see her suffer until she’s gone for good. So fucked up this cancel culture. How did James Charles survive but Coleen got lit right up?"
"i have never in my life expected colleen to ever be attacked and harassed like this or “canceled” ever ever ever. everyone is making fun of her for making a song out of the situation but if you actually knew her, she’s a singer, she sings for EVERYTHING, that’s who she is. she’s always made songs for everything. her actual, genuine, supporters know this. im not trying to account for her mistakes, but she is addressing it in the way she felt most comfortable. idk, i have been supporting her for more than 10 years and still love her, she’s a good person. with a huge heart. who has made mistakes. but so has the rest of the world."
COLLEEN I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUU. FUCK THESE PEOPLE. YOU CANT SAY IT SO I WILL. FUCK EM. KEEP DOING YOU AND MAKING PEOPLE LIKE ME SMILE AND HAPPY ! I lOVE YOU SO MUCH.
I have been around since the Josh era. I have essentially grown up WITH u...im 36. I do know theres a huge difference from what we SEE on youtube vs &quot;real life&quot;. But i have watched u go thru so much. We have been pregnant together. Cried together. U have cried far more than i have lol but when Flynn was born i balled my eyes out. When u posted ur pregnancy announcements and ur old house tour after u bought ur new home i cried with u. Most recently the death of ur chickens. U cant FAKE being a good person. We all make really shitty mistakes. When i first heard about this drama i started watching one of those videos and i stopped almost immediately. I just wanted to know what was happening. I simply didnt believe and i still dont that u harmed anyone intentionally. I hope u make it thru cuz u are one of the only people i still watch faithfully and it breaks my heart. Mostly cuz i feel like i know u and i know how much this is hurting u. I can only imagine the anxiety and stress this is causing. Ur poor fingers must be worn raw. Chin up friend. ❤
Genius
I hope you&#39;re ok Colleen! Been a fan since the start and saw/met you at your shows. You are always so lovely and kind to your fans. Its so upsetting to see you like this! And I hate the cancel culture thats picking up so much more these days. I wish people wouldn&#39;t spread fake rumours. Get the truth before kicking off!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I can’t believe you’re back. Please don’t ever leave YouTube. We love you Colleen ❤
courage girl .. courage .. you rock
I believe that she didn&#39;t have any bad intentions I mean she did some weird stuff but I don&#39;t believe that by heart she&#39;s bad person
We love you ❤
"Love you, girl be strong! People can make mistakes and people doesn’t have to be literally so cruel for it. I never read the comments but boyy people are mean. I actually think that their making mistakes. Whatever happens i support you! ❤❤"
am i the only one who thinks its decent
"Cancel culture sucks! Everyone makes dumb mistakes in their lives. Unfortunately, for people well known, it ends up being smeared everywhere. Yes, she made a few silly mistakes but it was very clear she was never &quot;grooming&quot; Adam and didn&#39;t have any sexual interest in him whatsoever. The only people that can throw a dagger in Colleen&#39;s direction are those who have never made a stupid mistake before and I&#39;m sorry to burst your bubble but that&#39;s no one!!"
I LOVE YOU
Y is this kinda good
"Colleen, sending you and your family so much love. The internet has really shown what a nasty place it can be here recently. <br>I know you are a kind, compassionate woman and mama. I hope your family and friends are wrapping you in love and support in this time.<br>We’re all human and it seems so many people have forgotten that. I hope to see you in this space in some capacity in the future but if not, I’m wishing you the best.❤"
Stay strong colleen! People just dont understand❤❤❤❤
COMING TO SPOTIFY WHEN!?!<br><br>Also here’s a frog 🐸
"Colleen i’ve been watching you since elementary school, I’m 25 now and i still completely and utterly support you. I think you are an amazing soul and you’ve always made me laugh and smile with your content. You will always have true supporters and fans like me that will stand beside you! Never give up, you have a beautiful family and a beautiful life that you’ve worked your ass off for. You should be proud of all you’ve accomplished and i wish you the very best always. ❤️❤️❤️"
I believe you... My past was pretty blah...<br>I miss you and your videos!
"I honestly don&#39;t believe colleen would do that I can see the miranda persona being strange at points, but she isn&#39;t a pedophile."
colleen. just keep on keeping on in spite of the storm. float above the noise. embrace the turbulence
Love you Colleen. So sorry you are going through this
"I mean we all gotta calm down. She chose to expose herself but no one is perfect. I really think she’s changed, people change and try to be better. We should all try and be better than yesterday, seriously who are we to judge people by their past??"
colleen u slayed this
Hey..don&#39;t believe any of the mean comments...I believe you and everyone make mistakes...I hope you keep posting videos soon 😊
Omg I know she mad some mistakes but she regrets her mistakes and she didn’t mean anything bad by it. I love Colleen and I miss her daily vlogs with the chickens and tortilla talk and everything she did in her vlogs. I wish you guys would stop being mean and here her side of the story.
"y’all clearly didn’t watch this video through and are just paying attention to the singing part, listen to the words, she’s genuinely sorry"
"I support you Colleen, people do make mistakes"
Let’s be honest… no matter what she said or did in this video she was going to get ripped apart for it anyway. All everyone wants to do is cancel her anyway without realizing people change.
Ngl she would be great in a play 😭
So glad to see you hopefully back! I completely have your back. I’ll be sending you a letter and some gifts for you and your kids soon. Love you and I’ve been praying for you every night. 💜💕🦋
I support you and am here for you.... Stop pandering to this weak-minded woke mentality.
"i loved this, i’m so over cancel culture. Ppl are overreacting for sure"
Colleen just hang in there people do make mistakes ❤
"Colleen, you are an absolutely amazing human being period and I adore you for this! I&#39;m so glad you spoke out about this stupid toxicity on the internet!!"
Guys she sang the song because it looks like she couldn’t get the words out otherwise. She’s clearly distraught and doesn’t deserve this. Nobody is perfect but we’re not on show for the world.
"For what it&#39;s worth, I do not think you&#39;re malicious."
No one is perfect. All of the allegations are from 10+ years ago. Move on and mind your own business.   I don’t think she owes everyone on the internet an apology. The only apology owed is to the ones that what has happened proteins to. So for the love of all that is good get off her back and find someone worse to attack
lol everyone in this comment section is mad because she called you out for having nothing better to do with your lives than dig up stuff people did YEARS ago and hold it against them
i love u colleen
I have been so worried about you. I may get attacked for this but I believe you didn&#39;t have any bad intentions and we are all human and I don&#39;t think you deserve all this. I may get attacked but idc i still love you
what she did was not ok but maybe the only way she can apologize is through music. so instead of being mad at the apologized through a ukulele be grateful that she apologize at all
Love you so much and always will!
Absolutely brilliant !!!
Bro y’all thought all the shit she was doing years ago was funny but now everyone’s upset bc we live in a social media world of cancel culture… y’all are wack 😂
I love you Colleen. The internet is a scary place and I can’t imagine having it has my job. I have missed seeing you and the kids. Stay strong
"I love you colleen, I don&#39;t care about what people are saying, you are amazing and keep your head up high gurl. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
"Yall are really just looking for someone on the internet to be upset with.. go get involved in your local communities and get mad at the people/politicians who are actually hurting humanity. No one should be this distraught by an internet personality who, in the grand scheme of life, isn&#39;t really a monster."
"No apology would be good enough for them. Good for you for not putting up with this. All of these allegations were already dealt with 3 years ago and you apologized. People need to move on. People make mistakes, people change and you’re real fans will be here when you get back"
This is amazing I love you Colleen ❤
YESSSS
The “fuck me right” at the end hurt bc Colleen you are my childhood and ilysm so don’t give up ❤😢
I LOVE YOU FOR THIS
"Look, I understand that there have been more than small mistakes made in the past and that Colleen should take a little more accountability for that. However, as she said, people make mistakes at the end of the day, and I don&#39;t think it is on the public to constantly scrutinise her about it.<br><br>If you don&#39;t like it, simply don&#39;t watch. <br><br>Her actions with fans in the past went over the line; however, that doesn&#39;t mean that she is a terrible mother; I have watched her vlogs since she got pregnant with the twins and didn&#39;t have any doubt about her love and devotion for them. Sure, they are displayed in videos, but what person online doesn&#39;t do that? It&#39;s not only her, and it&#39;s something to look back at for memories.<br><br>Again I say if you dislike it, don&#39;t watch it. I will never understand how people think that it is ok to harass others. She is well aware of her mistakes and leaving harassing comments won&#39;t change that."
Well this was iconic! Everyone wanted her to speak and there you go 🤷‍♀️...I like her.
Good for you for talking and defending yiurself!<br>Love you so much PERIOD.
I love you so much and i will always support you you help me through so much.❤
were all human!! I still love you
I LOVE THIS IM SORRY COLEEEN!
honestly the most real response to drama iv ever seen. always here for you for colleen! ❤
"At the very beginning of collen&#39;s yt career, she has been sharing with us how introvert, shy,loner  little girl or even up to now she is. This yt thing and popularity is not even her intention why she is making yt videos up until now. So if we come and think of it, she is not used to having a lot of attention from anyone. We should all be understanding and give everyone a chance to grow from their mistakes. Our generation is far different from their&#39;s, it is nice to see that young people are making a change, but we should not shame anyone for making something wrong especially if it&#39;s the past and that person is trying to have a life and change for the better."
"I love you, although the singing wasn’t the right way to approach it I’m on your side."
I keep singing this song in my head i love it
You need to read THESE comments and not the HATERS comments!<br>They are just making videos for views and clout.
"i’m reading comments and some of you definitely came here to just hate. she said her team do not want her to speak about it, they never said she can’t sing it. she obviously wants to say her part, but her team is stopping it, which is why she turned it into a song. i’m not justifying what she has done, or what others in this situation have done, but you all seem to pick and choose what you want to hear."
Awww hugs 😢❤
I missed u Colleen stay strong!!!!!♥️
Brave and Strong.
i love this Colleen hope you come back !
sending positive thoughts your way.  You will get through this difficult time with the support of your family..
This is the best response ever.<br>I miss your vlogs so much and i hope you are coming back!
I actually love this song!
I still Love YOU ❤
"Love you, Colleen!  ❤"
I miss you Colleen!
Colleen I know it’s hard to ignore the internet trolls. No one is perfect and everyone makes mistakes. I know you left this in the past and pray the bullying can stop. You are a great mother and wife and this too shall pass! Sending prayers! ❤
IDK WHAT YALL SAYING SHE ATE
I love you colleen
Y’all are just hating still no matter how she presented an apology or explanation. You consent to going to her shows watching her and continue to do so so
stop why did u eat
I love you so much and this song
if people dont like you thats on them and it doesnt matter if they dont because there are still people who love you
Coleen i support you ❤ Don&#39;t let these bullies try and make lies about you.
"Ignore everyone, keep doing your thing"
Don&#39;t let anyone shit on you.  Great singing voice.  Subscribed
"Just do you, turn off comments and keep posting"
im with you
"Honestly, 10/10 song"
I&#39;VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH😭😭😭😭
"Colleen did take accountability for what happened in the past and explaining the show is PG-13. Apparently everyone is tone deaf because she is explaining everything she has done was wrong and how she fucked up. I’m not making a excuses for her because honestly she is a great person, but shit everyone does wrong especially really hurting people. Nobody is perfect. She is not manipulating no one."
I still luv you Colleen🫶🫶
"Look around you Colleen, there is more support for you than you think. Supporters aren’t as loud as the jealous zealots. Look after yourself and your family first. ❤"
Hey Colleen. This is just a moment and it may feel like torture that it will never go away. Focus on your family and yourself. This too shall past.
❤
this is actually kind of awesome
I&#39;ve missed your beautiful face I&#39;m so sorry you are going through this! People can be so heartless 💔  I hope to see you back 🙏
I still love her fr
"not her saying exactly what y’all would say, everyone makes mistakes &amp; if you are attacking her for her past.. u are bored with your own life."
This slaps
"People suck, its ok. Keep your head up"
Sending so much love ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"She has some good points but she is a mom so I do think she is going through it. I’m so sorry Colleen, hopefully you take time for your mental health, and you have been on the internet for so many years so a break is good for you. And I hope you do reach out to the people that felt abused in this situation. The internet is a scary place but hope everyone gets there peace. ❤"
Is nobody realizing all this stuff that she “did” was in the past. EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES!!!!!!!!
I love you Colleen. I miss you videos I watched every single one since before Flynn was born. I hope you come back.
hi.
"even if she would cried and fell to the floor and said sorry a million times y’all would of still said “ she’s gaslighting us” she is still a horrible person” and she every possible thing to keep on just HATING, she’s changed and either way little kids shouldn’t be in her shows since u can clearly tell her character is for older audiences NOT 7-8 yrs olds!! so if the parents take them to her show they shouldn’t get mad since everything she does is part of her ACT"
Omg she made some mistakes in her past. I bet everyone who is calling her namea never made mistakes to and haven’t taken accountability for it. Think as if this is happening to you won’t be funny if it did. Leave her alone
"I don&#39;t know the entire story with what kind of messages she sent to fans. But what I do know is it was forever ago. There&#39;s way worse well-known people still out there. Idk why this apology is hated when she could have listen to her team and not acknowledged anything, but she felt as if she needed to. She&#39;s come so far from where she started, she helps more then she&#39;s &quot;hurt&quot; since then. Like she said people say things and everyone feels like they want to be part of something by hating her. Your not just hurting her but the family she&#39;s grown and the loved ones that have to see her in distress. It&#39;s really sad, and I&#39;m not trying to validate anything that she has done. But I&#39;m sure u guys have forgiven friends and family that&#39;s done more then just text people trying to be funny in an inappropriate way. Sorry ur going through this love, I hope u come out on the other side and u have the strength to carry on despite. The internet is a cruel maze of funhouse mirrors. It&#39;s hard to navigate when everything so distorted. But it&#39;s easy to follow somebody else&#39;s lead when they think they know what&#39;s real. Just carry on and you&#39;ll find ur way out of this mess. 🩷🩶You still have fans🩷🩶"
Colleen you don’t need to apologize. Anyone that thinks you’ve done something horrible I can bet if we looked through that persons phone they too could have something taken out of context. I would think people would be very careful with accusations now say as we know a lawsuit will punish those that are lying. Im so sorry Colleen ❤
She still ate!!
🤟
"colleen, the ones who know, know. I love you"
I cried on seeing you! I love you Colleen and always will.. Your vlogs helped me so much during my rough days! Thank you for all of it. ❤
❤❤I Still Love You ❤❤always will and I miss seeing you on
colleen I still love you!!! please stay positive
She doesn’t need to apologize that dude took that information and ran with it clout…just get over it… I don’t believe anything that anyone says about her or her family…
I FUCKING TOOK HOURS TO READ EVERY FUCKING ASS COMMENT AND 99% OF THEM WERE HATE COMMENTS AND THAT JUST MADE ME CRY
"You can&#39;t change the past, but you can do better moving forward"
You will never be terrible.<br>You have changed!
"Hi Colleen❤️ and who ever else will read this! <br>I am so glad you made this video and I think you need it to. I have always been a silent fan. I rarely comment, but I watch every single one of your videos not exaggerating. I started watching what other people were saying about you and I began to question if it was true, but then I would see some wild things. For example, one creator made a video about you, and he had never even watched you assuming you are a family vlogger when you have said, explicitly you are not. Videos of your past of you saying not so kind things have resurfaced. What irritates me is people refuse to see your growth and the fact that you are an advocate for so many people. You are a best friend to strangers on the Internet who need you when they have nobody else, you’re a mom who reminds other moms that they are strong too, you have have mental health issues and advocate for the fans you love to accept their mental health issues as well and everybody who watches you knows they’re not alone. What people fail to realize is that your fan following is not a cult, we are people who have made mistakes too and admire your willingness to grow as a person and learn new things about life that you once didn’t know. You teach others to open their minds, just as you have learned to. Please never quit posting. Please keep being the inspiration you are , please keep being the amazing mother you are please keep being the fun, kind, creative person you are."
I missed you! I know music is your way of coping. Keep your head up!
Okay slay I love you colleen
👏👏👏 i love this response
Team colleen❤❤❤❤❤
low key worked on me
I love this ❤️ you are a beautiful person inside and out. ❤❤
"i love u and i will always will❤ u shouldnt have to apologize again, your amazing im sorry ur going through this again bb, u dont deserve this"
Literally could not have responded in any better way
This might not be the way to handle it BUT FOR ONCE YOU ARE STICKING UP FOR YOURSELF  and being YOU! Good for you!
😍😍😍😍😍😍
"Honestly I LOVE THIS I always have these thoughts when old videos or things resurface of celebrities from 10+ years ago. Like,,, tell me YOURE still the same person you were back then.  Oh youve changed??? Yeah, so have they. <br><br>You go Colleen!!!  You’re the only one that’s actually explaining, and being serious, instead of crying and just saying sorry."
"You are a bright spot in my days and an astoundingly beautiful soul. I’m so happy to see your face again, girl. Sending all the positive vibes in the world to you. Hope they wrap around you like a blanket. Rest. Breathe deeply. Tomorrow is a new day, and there are millions of people who love you and stand in your corner. Actual millions! Let that sink in. You are so incredibly loved…for exactly who you are. <br><br>You’ve got this ❤❤❤"
Honestly she’s so real and true for this
You’ve changed my mind! 💛
Colllllleeeeeennn I freaking love the crap out of you... this makes me sad that your sad I hateeeee it...
"All the comments about &quot;this is a terrible apology, this is not an apology.&quot; NO, IT&#39;S NOT MEANT TO BE. She&#39;s standing up against cancel culture.  It&#39;s the bravest move she&#39;s ever made.  Good on her."
"I have no idea what’s going on here, but…my heart! This was a great video. I love the words and the music. It’s all so good.  I hope you get through whatever you’re going through ❤"
I love you so much. Always have always will
Colleen. I love you so much.<br>What you did was wrong BUT a you HAVE CHANGED!!<br>I’m Amman from your Thousand Oaks show.<br>You are amazing and I will always appreciate you.
People are going to criticize your response no matter how you say it. I think this was a perfect representation of who you are and I’m so proud of you for finally standing up for yourself. Those of us that watch you religiously have seen you grow as a person and know who you are to your core- a good person who may have made some mistakes in the past… JUST LIKE THE REST OF US. love you forever queen 💜💜💜
Love you Colleen
"y’all are so annoying. she’s a person too. anything can be screenshotted and take out of context. she could have handled the situation better but she is right, she has changed her ways. and she is openly admitting that it wasn’t appropriate to say to her fans. if this was a man, everyone would be over this within a day. y’all are so bored with your own lives that you involve yourselves in someone else’s."
"I’m so sorry this is happening to you right now ❤ Please take care of yourself 💕 Things will get better. Your babies need you to be happy, healthy, and strong. Unfortunately the internet sucks and people jump on the hate train. Just remember that you have a ton of amazing people in your life that love you and know the real you. Just focus on the beauty in your life and let the negativity wash away. Sending positive vibes to you and yours❤"
"Idc what people say, I still fully support, things have been twisted"
this is so smart
nice
Oh.😇
"I wouldn&#39;t listen to all the bull crap that they were posting.  I have been waiting for you to come back knowing it would take a bit.  Hang in there.  Sorry, this is happening.  Hope your family is doing alright and I hope you are alright as well."
"I love colleen, I grew up watching her. I don’t think she is a groomer or predator. She has always been my favorite person, I like that she has made this into a song, I get bored watching people apologize for 30 minutes and not mean a thing. She has turned this accountability and song into something else that will take the pain away for her and makes it a little light hearted. She has talked to her fans, but a lot of tubers call their fans their “best friends” and Colleen actually made initiative to talk to them. I see where she is coming from with that, Colleen is just the aunt that is trying to be there for the kids so they have someone safe to talk to. I love and support Colleen❤ always have and always will."
this was a slay
"I&#39;m literally balling I&#39;m so sorry colleen, I love you no matter what"
I’m standing here with you Colleen! 🫶🏻
Guys she made a video taking accountability when this was brought up YEARS AGO.
❤
COLLEEN I LOVE YOU
This is perfect i love you Colleen sending you love and hugs 🫂💌
Why do people bring up stuff that happened in her past. This is clearly not what she is doing now. I am sure many of us have done or said things in our past that we don&#39;t do now. Would you like others to keep holding your mistakes against you?
Colleen I love you so much I honestly don’t understand why people keep bringing this up after you already addressed it so many times and it’s in the past so that’s where it should stay love you girly it was so good to see your face again❤
stay strong ❤❤❤❤❤
The cancel culture bullshit needs to stop. She&#39;s only human at the end of the day. People make mistakes. You shouldn&#39;t have to answer to haters. Appaled at people&#39;s judgement. 2020 and onwards the years of cancel culture. Ridiculous.
She ate this
"Colleen, I LOVE YOU!!! I’ve never commented on a YouTube video EVER, but I have followed you for almost 10 years and you deserve SUPPORT!🤍🤍🤍 You are a hardworking, passionate person who is devoted to connecting with her fans. People grow and change, and if there’s anyone who recognizes that and takes accounts for it on social media it’s YOU, queen! It’s wrong for people to tear your life apart over a silly mistake and lies. I stand with you and you haven’t lost a fan here🤍"
I missed Colleen!
Thank you for standing up for yourself and not giving into bullies.  Your fans are proud of you! ❤❤❤❤
I love you Colleen I’m sorry about this ❤
Ive missed you!!
"Colleeeeennn, I’VE BEEN SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU. <br><br>my heart is with you.  And I believe in you."
"I know you&#39;re a good person . People just need something or someone to bitch about. I&#39;ve been watching you since 2019, and you showed nothing, but being a nice person and a great Mom❤"
I feel so bad for her 😢
Colleen stay strong people make mistakes and thats ok. Love u and its good to see u again on our screens we&#39;ve missed u
Love you Colleen ❤️
The fact that you can here that she is trying not to cry talking about this is what you need to here she is taking accountability and realizing her actions she hasn’t done them in the longest time and that was never her freaking intention so if you’ve been a fan for a long time you should know that.
❤️
"I feel so bad for her. Can’t even interact with fans without people trying to make it out to be something it clearly wasn’t. But low lives &amp; weirdos on the internet don’t care about the facts. They’ll make up shit &amp; just run with it. Y’all need to go touch grass, &amp; stop starting rumors like middle schoolers. We get it, your life is miserable &amp; pathetic, but you don’t have to put that misery onto others 💯"
People are just hating for more views!<br>We all love you 🥰
I hope you see this comment and know that I’m completely on your side for this. Everything being said is so ridiculous! Bunch of lies and rumors. <br><br>Rooting for you Colleen🩷🩷🩷🩷
Love you.
"Colleen I will always love you for the laughter, the chance to spend time with your beautiful family who also brought me lots of laughter &amp; joy.  You are a human just like me &amp; everyone else.  We are all accountable when we reach the age of adulthood to take accountability for ourself &amp; seek help, recognize it &amp; apologize. You did all those years thing.  Others should do that too!  I will always love you Colleen because when you know better, you did better.  Everything will be ok.  Love the beautiful family you were blessed  with.  If you chose not to come back online I will miss you dearly.  God loves you.  So does your family.  It will be OKAY hugs"
I’m proud of you Colleen and hey I miss you so much
"It&#39;s so so obvious that you guys aren&#39;t even watching this video. Please LISTEN to her, please listen to this video. It isn&#39;t just a song, she&#39;s addressing and taking accountability for her actions. She&#39;s giving you WHAT YOU WANT!"
Walk away move forward in life every one love colleen family kids husband are number one vlogs
I do not care. Just keep putting out content. Let that beautiful voice sing.
❤️
I’ve missed seeing you. I know ur not but hope you’re keeping ok. Sending love and support to you xx❤xx
You’ll never win with the internet trolls. It really is so reflective of THEM and NOT YOU that they are destroying everything you have built for your family. Keep on keeping on girl. ❤️❤️
Went onstage with you Thoysand Oaks (Amman)<br>And I will ALWAYS love you because…<br>YOU HAVE CHANGED YOU QUEEN.<br>YOU NEED 20K TIARAS AND CROWNS 👑 <br><br>LOVE YOU LIKE THE WORLD BESTIE.
So sad…. I don’t believe the crap they are saying about you….. the world turned to shit because of the internet….
I’m only three minutes into this at the moment and Colleen speaking to you as a mom and have been watching you for a very long time. I just want to give you a hug and to let you know that you are loved. And I respect the hell out of you and I think you’re truly an absolutely amazing person and I’m sorry that you’re going through this.
Colleen...hugs to you and your family...your great and such a wonderful mom and wife and friend...now I only know you by watching your videos and things...but your such a sweet talented woman...thank you for making us smile and happy..this will pass...just hold on to your loved ones and stay strong....I am truly sorry people are mean and how people are so quick to judge..I loved to see that you posted...I have been hoping to see you soon...love u take care and love yourself and enjoy your friends and family❤
"Colleen if you see this, I see you and I hear you. I am so sorry you&#39;re hurting and that your safe place turned violent. This will die down. You will survive this &quot;crash&quot; and those that love and care about you will be there for you as you land. <br>P!nk&#39;s song &quot;Turbulence&quot; is one of my favourite songs right now, I hope you listen to it on repeat. &quot;When it hits, don&#39;t forget as scary as it gets It&#39;s just turbulence...&quot; One hell of a M*th** F**king bought of turbulence, and it may feel like the plane is going to crash...it&#39;s just turbulence...this too shall pass. Also a really good song for any anxiety sufferer btw. <br>❤❤❤"
glad you&#39;re back  I&#39;ve been worried about you!
very well said.
❤
You still have fans that love and support you.
"We love you Colleen, all of the people saying these things are just chronically online teenagers who overanalyse and want to hurt good people❤️"
DONT LISTEN TO THEM COLLEEN I LOVE YOU ❤❤❤❤❤
Don’t worry Colleen your gonna get through this keep strong and don’t listen to the negativity social media is a toxic and horrible place keep your head up
"Couldn’t listen because the format is pretty cringey, but read the transcript and think there is validity to the commentary (and some clever turn of phrase)."
"I hope you’re doing okay, I’ve been a fan for years and know how hard all of this has been on you. Remember that some people still love and support you. Cancel culture will do anything to get somebody down until it moves on to the next person. Keep yourself and those babies safe and healthy ❤️❤️"
Colleen I’m so happy you’re back. I’ve missed you. Behind a comedian is hard now and I just want you to know I’m always by your side. I’ve watched you for 10 years and I’ve seen SO MUCH WONDERFUL GROWTH IN YOU. keep on loving yourself
Don’t let the little bitter people dull your light. It’s jealousy on a next level.
sending support and love your way! &lt;3
I can’t wait for this all to end. I miss your vlogs and want it to go back to normal!!!
We ALL make mistakes ❤
"Good for you!! I love this very much. No matter what you say, how you say it, when to say it. Good for you Colleen"
"Not everyone believes the ugly stuff!!! Not anyone in this world is free from life mistakes! I know it doesn’t feel like it, but this will pass and the haters will move onto the next victim!!! I know it feels like it, but you aren’t alone! I know you may never see this, but I hope somehow you feel those of us wishing you good things and believing in you! ❤"
"Don&#39;t worry girl, I love you😢"
I love you so much Colleen! You&#39;re so strong and I love that you have made it this far without giving up. Be you and stay amazing!
Like get it queen!
💜💜💜💜
Good for you Colleen!!! This BS will die down eventually.  💕
"I Hounestly wish people could really see what she’s saying like she’s gone a strange way about it but it draws attention to a valid point , if everyone was world famous on the internet for most their life, there would be things from everyones past that could be dug up to cancel them , people are so quick to be vile on the Internet and it adds up , all hate and facism is wrong but poorly made jokes in a time where no one called people out for these things dosnt mean these celebrity’s need to kill themselves to equal justice"
"Spot on. Cancel culture is so dumb, just a bunch of people getting high on hating together😂 <br><br>I truly enjoy your content as one of the last youtubers that still dares to share as much as you do. And as an awkward person myself, its so sad and scary how people gang up and prescribe intent behind other peoples actions, and defense seems futile =\<br><br>I hope that hate wont win this time❤"
"leave her alone. <br>this should be discussed and dealt with her lawyers/agent she doesn’t need to apologize to anyone, we all make mistakes and we are all humans. nobody is perfect. <br>stop commenting nasty comments on her video, that isn’t good for her mental health and you don’t know what that can do to her."
COLLEEN I LOVE YOU EVEN MORE! Keep it up! I agree!!!
"Colleen. I feel you. I  am shook at how little people research their gossip. We know you. We love you. Forget all these trolls. They will be gone soon enough from your comments. And we, your fans will still be here. ❤❤"
Omg Colleen I freaking love u so damn much. Know that I stick up for u everywhere and I’m sure im not the only one. I’m so glad u r back. I am so so damn sorry u r going through this. U r the best person ever imo. Ppl ruin every and anything good… omg I’m so damn sorry Colleen. I can’t imagine what this feels like
"Colleen I will stand in front, behind you, to your left and right and above. I&#39;ve really missed you."
Colleen pls know I’m still here to support you. You will get through this. ⭐️🩷⭐️🩷⭐️🩷⭐️🩷⭐️
"I believe you did nothing wrong Colleen. You may have been naive perhaps, but you’ve earned your successes and deserve to be heard. It’s so unfair what is happening to you with people who haven’t followed or known you making those decisions. Those of us who have know you would never intentionally hurt or use people. Chin up Colleen. Some of us still love and adore you."
I love you colleen miss the vlogs like I miss a dear friend.
"Didn&#39;t she play a ukulele in some other videos? I have watched on and off for years and I remember her doing that at some point, maybe about haters or pregnancy or something like that.. i can&#39;t remember."
Don’t pay attention to any of these haters! I absolutely loved the song and agree with the words in it! It was so nice to see your face! Stay strong! You know the real fans and the real people who aren’t herd followers support you and wish you the best! <br>Waiting for you to come back and miss your vlogs! ❤
Haters back off!!!!
Omg colleen we love  you so much and ignore what they are saying if they are lies. And I know you love to volg so do what you love and we understand that you made mistakes but you have grown so much. Any way I miss you and your kids and chickens and hearing about your life. I love you  so much and I hope this helps
"Love this. People are bored. You got this. People are bored with their lives and just tryna fit in. You will always have support from me and you loyal fans. Everyone messes up in life, if people brought up with I did 10 years ago I would also be cancelled. Everyone would. So much love to you and your family ❤❤❤❤"
❤
"You guys are really tearing this human to shreds. Yes she made mistakes. Like she was saying we all have! The only difference is hers are on display for the world to see. She’s still a HUMAN. You never know what someone is going through. Do you really want to be her OR ANYONES 13th reason? Yes she is playing victim. Because she is a victim!! From everyone’s attacks online telling her horrible horrible things you would never wish on yourself. Colleen, I’m praying for you. Despite the wrongs, I know you’re not a “bad person”"
❤
this is the besttttttt.
Um I have no words at this point. Idk all that happened and I feel that we shouldn’t judge what happened bc we don’t rly know all that happened.
I love you Colleen omg
Keep your head up girl.. all of this is a reach…
"I am so sorry you are caught up in this toxic energy that is floating around right now, and it is just making me so sad for you and your beautiful family. Love and Light and Healing Energy to you all."
❤
You are so loved ❤
I misss u … don’t let them win!!!
Y’all really got nothing better to do. If I see the word victim one more time I’m gonna puke. Grow up. Get a life. Leave the girl alone.<br><br>Hang tight Coleen. The world is your oyster and they want the pearl you hold. Everyone just looking for a cash out. Re route. Re focus. 💜💜
"we all wanted for you to post anything, we all missed you and love you… you true fans and the people that can use their critical thinking❤️ You don’t deserve and it is sad that today’s reality is NOT based on facts but perception🫠 i love you, always have always will❤️"
No bc she is actually making a point and you people are saying it is cringy when she&#39;s trying to apologize even tho she did nothing wrong
OK SONG WRITER!!!
"Judge not lest ye be judged. Yes she has done stuff in her past that she will never do again, everyone has done stuff they regret in their lives, the only difference is ours isn&#39;t online for all to see, so we can hide ours. Colleen I hope you will read this, because I see you need some support, for someone to listen to your words, and accept them, and move on from this toxicity. I know people will not agree with my supporting you. I don&#39;t care. Colleen you have a beautiful heart, your kind, you are human ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
Try to hang in there Colleen! There are a lot of people who have watched you for years and can see both sides and know your heart. You’ve already apologized for this years ago and have changed your behavior. It’s not fair that it’s blown up like this. Come back when you’re ready ❤and your true fans will be here waiting.
Idc what y’all say she ate
i forgive you miranda<br>Hope it gets better
💕💕💕💕💕
Colleen is a really good person at heart and I know she would never do anything that was meant to hurt anyone or offend anyone! Everyone makes mistakes and they usually learn from them! I love you Colleen❤ Please keep posting and be strong for your mental health and kids and family and supports that love you!!!
"I teared up when I saw you had posted! ❤ My mind is not changed about you. Not your video and not any of the s**t I&#39;ve seen in the last few weeks. You are just a human like everyone of us. Careing, loveing, funny, smart, strong.. With and without mistakes... I&#39;m so so so sorry you have to go through this! Sending love and hugs your way.  Stay strong, Colleen. You don&#39;t deserve this..❤❤❤"
I Honestly don&#39;t know certain people anymore. None of us are perfect. Leave her alone. Are you fffff perfect.
I don&#39;t like commenting on videos but YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT I MISS UR CUTE LITTLE VLOGS &lt;3 everyone needs to just touch some grass
"this is the best response to anything i&#39;ve ever seen. i am obsessed with this response LMAO i love you so fuckin much dude i am ,laughing so hard at these comments"
"Colleen I know there is coming to be a loot of hate comments on here but I hope you see this one: I will never judge anyone on their past even if it was bad, people can and will make mistakes but people can also change. I know it’s not a tun there ARE people including me that actually care about you and won’t believe anything bad people will say about you. I am so glad you made this video because I was so worried about you and just know to take as much time as you need. I love you Colleen you did nothing wrong in my eyes ❤️❤️❤️ and the only ones that really matter is your family and people who actually care about you. Don’t apologize to people who won’t except it. Love ya 🫶🏻"
Stay strong❤
"PSA FOR EVERYONE COMMENTING<br>if you don’t like her, if you think she is a bad person. Then why are you watching this vid? I hope you all know commenting and watching this video is MAKING HER MONEY AND PAYING HER BILLS."
I LOVE YOU COLLEENNN THIS WAS AMAZING !
Love you Colleen! Please hang in there.
yes you are a human and we all make mistakes. I&#39;m seeing you in boise so im excited &lt;3
So happy to see this from you. You need to keep posting because that is the only way to reclaim this narrative. Things got as out of control as they did because you were too quiet. I love you Colleen. Please be well and take care of yourself
I love you ❤
❤❤❤❤
i love you forever colleen im not even going to try to figure out why you got cancelled or why you&#39;re apologizing but i love you and thats all that matters i dont care what your past has to tell us.
"I just wanted you to know although i wasnt there for this guys claim days and havent really watched miranda, i have watch you throughout all three kids and enjoy your channel. I cant see the side of you they are trying to put out and even so i can tell even if some parts you admitted were mistakes and you owned up to it. You are only human colleen. You are not who you were and even then i do not think you were like they are trying to insinuate: people grow and learn at any rate and you are no difference and do not deserve to be torn apart. Pleas do not let them destroy you and although its hard when it seems like everyone is against you- they arent. Im not and i do not think you are horrible. I dont know what happened in the past but it is the past. One thing i know is you have three beautiful children that need their mommy. Show them your strength and how you persevere through troubled times. Please keep your head up."
"Colleen, you seem really genuine and sweet. Our world has nothing better to do than get power by tearing people down. Its other peoples insecurities that cause them to reach so far for anything to hurt someone. Keep your head up doll, I may be some faceless words on a screen but the joy you bring by just being you has helped my anxiety and depression, I am sure I am not the only one. Keep bringing your light to the world. You are impactful in the most positive way. ❤❤❤"
Keep going Colleen I believe in you still
EVIL PEOPLE IN THE COMMENTS! DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR AND DONT WATCH HER  AND KEEP IT MOVING! UNSUBSCRIBE AND WATCH WHO YOU LIKE! SO MANY NASTY PEOPLE ON HERE!
Gosh I love her for this ❤❤❤
"To the people who are attacking her “ grow the hell up”, it’s not her fault. She just wanted to connect with her fans, and to the people who feel “trauma”, you shouldn’t have responded or even dm’ed her . To the people who feel “trauma” grow the hell up and admit you shouldn’t have done that like a crazy fan. This cancel culture’s is the stupidest thing ever. Why can’t people make mistakes like what humans are supposed to do. To the people who don’t make mistakes, your parents must of had y’all on a chain and the belt in there hand."
stay strong!
Love you !
This is 10 minutes of spitting facts 💯 <br>where is the song available on spotify? I wanna listen over and over again. I love you Colleen.

❤
y’all cut her some slack pls 😭 she made some mistakes but haven’t we all omfg. y’all are talking about stuff that happened years ago AND had NOTHING to do with most of you 😭😭 y’all saying hurtful things is just as bad. she’s not a bad person and you can tell her intentions weren’t bad either. accept the apology and move on. find something positive to obsess over pls 😭😭
Colleen we all are here for you the things they are saying about you is awful and bang out of order and it’s not fair to you but we love you girl and your amazing xxxxx❤❤❤
"Love you, believe you."
"Hey colleen, please try and remember that people are always quick to share negativity and the ones who are seeing this whole situation for what it is are just a lot less likely to show support. But they do support you. Keep fighting x"
You can all be mad idc but I agree with Collen with everything she sings in this. You should really look into yourselves...are you all perfect? Some of you should put all this energy into your own lives and your environment.
"Colleen, stay strong, you have fans and always will, i have always stuck by your side, and i will keep doing it as i find everything very weird and unbelievable, people are so so mean, people make mistakes, and terrible ones , but like you said, you changed. I hope you come back soon, i miss you and your family ♥️♥️"
I’m on ur side girl u got tgis
"Colleen, I&#39;ll always support you i&#39;m not disappointed in you or mad at you i love you🥰"
Poor girl wish I could give her a big hug

"Hey<br>Just wanted to say everything’s gonna be okay soon.❤People,well mostly children who are dramatizing this situation will just forget about this in a week or two like it always happens. Idk maybe some things were true but how i see it  just some people trying to get views and make some money and of course get attention with making you look bad🤦‍♀️<br>Hope you’re being strong and won’t give up cuz I’m still waiting for those everyday vlogs, Miss you💕"
People make mistakes.
Team Colleen 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
I mean she has a point.
I stand by Colleen lol
got ur back colleen idc ❤️ people nowadays are so desperate for online drama to try and make their boring lives more interesting
"Hi Colleen, I don&#39;t know what happend this past couple of days/weeks, but I hope you know that people who cares about you are out there. Take care &lt;3"
I have always seen some hate comments and felt very sorry for the creator who is receiving the message but this is infuriating me. i have watched you since i was very very young and i know you think a lot about what you put on the internet and you are always very careful. i do not believe these rumors are true and i love you! stay strong❤️
"❤Colleen, I really hope you&#39;ll see this among all the bullshit. I&#39;ve been watching you forever and don&#39;t give a flying f about the alleged &quot;proof&quot; or &quot;screenshots&quot; - you could never do what these morons are accusing you of, and anyone with a brain can see that. Wish you strength and hope one day you will look back and feel grateful for the experience that made you even stronger. Sending love ❤"
"I love Colleen and I stand by her. I know she did already made a video and explained. When people tries to get clouts by destroying others reputation, that is when I draw the line. <br>She made her mistakes, she did account for them years ago but the need if some to get their 15 min of fame, and likes, and new subscribers under slander and messing up someone&#39;s life, carreer and mental health... I cannot agree. I will continue to support her. <br>Colleen, I senserely hope that you are getting mental help that you need at this moment. Be safe 🙌🏻💪🏻 be strong!!"
Keep making videos my love were with you f the ones that ain’t
🥰
"You take a whole bunch of mistakes over many years and call her a bad person… we all have made mistakes. Colleen is so kind hearted and would never intentionally hurt another. She has apologized and explained herself over and over for these things over time… enough is enough. Colleen is right that it’s all for clout and views. If you don’t like Colleen, please leave. This was a special place for the rest of us before all this."
she didn&#39;t deserve this :(
Honestly you ate queen
F*@! them little trolls!  You rock!! ❤
HIIIII IM YOUR BIGGEST FAN IGNORE THESE AWFUL PEOPLE THAT ARE MAKING RUMORSS🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
i love you colleen
WOW🤩
"At this point you have nothing to hate about your just halting on mistakes everyone learns from and makes. Making a song and apologizing  and explaining yourself is super smart and mabye easier for coolen, give her a break please. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone has a heart and feelings.❤ sending love to you coolen and the person who is reading this"
💗💖💞❤
"I don’t think you’re a bad person at all. I had tears in my eyes listening to your song, and I am so sad you’re going through this. I truly feel like you said it perfectly, in that people are just having fun trying to ruin you. The comments on this video continue to prove that. I support you, and I don’t believe these false accusations. People make mistakes, including the ones trying to hurt you. ❤you!"
"i honestly think this is a fair apology, people communicate their emotions in different ways, this was hers<br>she took apology and said what she did was wrong and she didn’t understand that<br>and for the rest, she can’t necessarily just take accountability for smth she didn’t do LMAO"
❤❤❤
"Colleen, I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;re going through this. I know people are going to think you&#39;re mocking, but I see the pain in your face and your voice. You know you can&#39;t convince anybody so you do what you do best during a hard time. I&#39;m still standing by you as a 33 year old mama who has always loved COLLEEN! I was never here for miranda, always you!"
"Oh sweetie,  I hate that you&#39;re going through such a hard time,  the world would be a perfect place if there were no people in it,  but sadly we have to put up with the crap things wordishes out,  I wish I could put my arms around you and take away the pain,  I&#39;m a Nana who loves your videos and your family,  you just do what you do best,  keep moving forward ❤️"
"As a long time viewer of Colleen, music is therapy to her and she’s made a bunch of ‘reading mean comments’ video on her channel and I think that’s the idea and vibe she went for. It backfired because people judged her based on this one video (instead of analysing/ knowing her behaviour for years as a subscriber) and a narcissistic boy on the internet (who gets way less views on his personal content lol). <br>Anyway, we have all made mistakes in life as humans, they may not be as public as celebrities go through. Forgive don’t forget and continue living life! The sooner you get out of your bubble of ‘life should be fair’, it isn’t so move on.<br>Glad you’re back Colleen ❤"
Its ok we forgive you 😢
"We came to your Indianapolis show, it was amazing! The kids (5 &amp; 3) had the best time. You are so strong for being able to perform &amp; put a happy face on when terrible people are trying to destroy your life. Stay strong girlie, this won’t last forever! Thank you for not canceling your shows!!"
Idc I love her ❤😊
Love Colleen!
"I enjoyed the song and it is built to the brim with truths about our society. A lot of people, from my experience, likes to formulate a thought based on information they learned without grabbing the concept that all information received isn&#39;t 100% revealed. As time progresses, incremental information will be discovered if the individual is vigilant and ready to absorb the information they are oblivious of noticing from their previous experience. Most people, like myself, prefer not to wait and would rather be noticed now versus being noticed some time in the future. People who put contemplative thought with the content they create (e.g. books, movies, etc.) release their media weeks, months, and maybe a year before they release their content for public viewing; yet people without the experience of being patient and will reply based on their current life situation and hopefully learn from their actions if it is a mistake. Their are two common phrases I&#39;m feeling is relatable with my perception trying to gain fame and/or notoriety (clout): &quot;players going to play&quot; and &quot;any publicity is good publicity&quot;."
People these days are never happy and find a problem with everything she has a good point and everything she said is valid
Colleen I love you so much I&#39;ve been watching you for years and to be fair it feels like we&#39;re friends (not in a weird way) I hope you come back I miss the vlogs. People will always hate but there&#39;s a point where they take it too far 😕
"Poor girl. I know everyone has their opinions, but I understand where she is comming from and no one should feel alone. I love you colleen❤"
We love you so much Colleen! Some people have very different opinions. But some people will still love you! Stay strong! We all make mistakes. ❤❤
💜💜💜💜💜
I miss you Colleen. I am so so sorry you are going through this.  I support you 100% and KNOW that you are a wonderful human in the line of toxic fire ... it&#39;s so unfair.
❤️
Love you girl. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re unapologetic because you didn&#39;t do anything wrong.  Don&#39;t let people&#39;s perceptions of your past dictate your present or future xx
"I love you darling, stay safe please"
literally ur the best
I thought I&#39;d check in and make a funny observation. Since I posted this video based on something a Daily Wire host said NONE of them have really mentioned the idea that Dylan is a comic genius. Why? Because they will never give anyone on the &quot;LEFT&quot; side credit for being clever or smart.
One person made more people stop drinking then AA has for 88 years.
This will go down in history as a &quot;not knowing who your target audience is&quot; event
The most expensive beer commercial of all time
Dylan Mulvaney stopped more alcoholics than prohibition 😂
The face that brought down an empire.
As a gay man this shit makes me wanna date real women again.
"In 50 seconds Dylan managed to offend men, women, and lose a company billions of dollars.<br>Very impressive."
Thank you Dylan for making many people realize they were drinking piss water
"Who on earth thought &quot;this is the way to boost our sales, use the person that 99%of our customers hate as a spokesperson&quot;? Great marketing"
"How to destroy a beer company. Dylan, “hold my beer”."
I’ve never met a woman that acted that way
How to lose your company $27 billion in 50 seconds.
I had to see the straw that broke the camels back 😂
Bro single handily destroyed a billion dollar company 😂
Mixing booze with hormone blockers? Dylan’s erratic behavior actually makes a lot of sense now
"25 billion dollar commercial, that also caused more people to stop drinking than all the treatment centers and AA combined. Unbelievable, what were they thinking?! 😂"
"This dude went from a long way from dumb videos to taking down a entire corporation, its impressive actually."
I asked my mom who doesn’t care for basketball what March Madness was and she said college basketball 😂 You did this to yourselves Budweiser.
Bud…. The queen of beers
"It’s not about trans hate. It’s about making the world realize that an imaginary gender change isn’t an achievement. It’s not worthy of anything, especially brand endorsement that put money in your pocket. People need to understand that changing your gender doesn’t make you special and you can’t force the world to comply."
49 seconds. Efficient destruction.
"Marketing Exec:  “Hey I have an idea, let’s give our core customer base the middle finger.”<br>CEO:  “Hmm?  What’s that?  Sure, whatever.  I’m busy golfing.”"
Leaving aside all the Dylan controversy... How can someone promote a beer for Marchmadness not knowing what that is or even what sport it&#39;s for? This ad looks like a HS project for a marketing class :/
Thanks to this man I have finally stayed sober for weeks and quit my addiction
"I’m not Bud Light’s target audience (as I think this stuff tastes like toilet water, and when I want to drink beer it’s not as a substitute for water), but I have friends / workers I’ve employed who are.  Let me tell you about the people who drink this stuff by the gallon. They drive Dodge Ram pickup trucks, motorcycles, watch sports as if it’s going out of style, wake up at 5 AM to go fishing, etc.  What were they thinking?  Wow!!!"
every time you watch a video of this guy it’s like a submitted audition tape. What a world we live in
Pass the Coors..
Let this be a lesson to multi million dollar companies. Don&#39;t let a hated person endorse your product.
This ad was definitely not made by bud light drinkers😂😂😂
Well there goes bud light 💀
"The Marketing Executive genius that commissioned this is now working on an advert for pilgrimage to Mecca starring some bacon farmers. Inclusivity matters, folks."
The fact that they doubled down by insulting women&#39;s knowledge of sports. 🤦🏻
"Bud light is undrinkable, once you get use to craft beers bud light taste like pothole water"
God that face is the same face my cat makes when i pick him up by the scruff of his neck
I got sober in 2009 but I started drinking again just so I could drink something else.
"Did anyone even take the time to test this in front of a test audience?  it’s stupid, insulting, cringey, nauseating."
The video that SINGLE HANDEDLY killed an entire corporation. 😂
even my wife who watches no sports at all knows what march madness is
Sometimes I regret leaving America…then I see this and remind myself I made the right decision 😂
Every alcoholic in my family has quit drinking thank you and Anheuser Busch
Can anyone say &quot;it&#39;s Miller time!&quot;? 🤣
Dude is making fun of women and that&#39;s the person they want on their beers. That&#39;s fucking hilarious.
Never drinking  this beer again😔
"Now it is official, the Americans have gone bonkers. Greetings from Holland."
Drank Budweiser for decades..no more
"I love the complete hilarity of this whole thing. So this commercial is the two of you &quot;celebrating&quot; him being a trans for 1 year, okay..?? And he doesn&#39;t even look like he is enjoying the beer, or even drinking it. And the look of his face on the beer can is something special, like even if you knew nothing about this whole situation, his face being like that on the can is extremely unappealing. And his whole &quot;go sports&quot; and his complete disconnected spiel of &quot;go enjoy...whatever it is you&#39;re doing. lol. all that matters is i&#39;m getting this sponsorship. So make sure to buy more beer with my face on it!&quot;.<br><br>I feel like this whole scenario is born out of a GTA game. The hilarity of it all is too surreal. How could ANYONE at Bud ever thought this was a good idea?"
"I felt a great disturbance in the force, as if millions of pot bellied middle aged white American males suddenly cried out in anger.- Obi Wan"
Gays and trans have been drinking bud light for years and yall mad now? 😂
"As Al Bundy said, &quot;Pretty women make us buy beer; ugly women make us drink beer.&quot;<br>In the case of Bud light, it looks like neither of these will happen that much now.<br>What a &quot;genius&quot; marketing move . . ."
"Please be the spokesperson for Monster energy, Fortnite and Vaping :)"
&quot;Bud light!  F--- that s---!  PABST BLUE RIBBON!&quot;  <br><br>-Frank Booth
"Budweiser might as well have licked every Bud Light can in America and said, “here, enjoy”."
Epic Fail for Bud Light. What the hell were they thinking?
I was very sceptical about social media influencers actually having any influence on consumers but in this case it seems to be working. After 20 consecutive years Bud Light is no longer the best selling beer in the US.
"So... Are people boycotting just because she&#39;s trans? &quot;We can&#39;t have no fake girls drinkin&#39; our beer, herp derp&quot; lol"
Demonic
Who in the marketing department thought this was a good idea 😂
This is what made conservatives so butt hurt lmao
"The damage one little twerp, can cause, is amazing!"
This is a generation raised by Disney
"Correct me if I am wrong. Anorexia, Schizophrenia both are said to have delusional characteristics &amp; have a place in the DSM 5. But a man with male parts but thinks &quot;he&quot; is a woman is not seen as delusional?"
"Love the sound of empty cans,"
"This man, I mean woman has quite the superpower taking down big corporations"
This is what has all the republicans crying over 😂🤣
"It’s time to boycott bigotry, and people that are homophobic and transphobic.   Get over it."
Haha loving watching Bud fail all the way from Australia.<br>- Adult human female 👌🏽
"&quot;Hi. My name is Dylan, and I&#39;m here to ruin your business.&quot; 😂"
Man we live in an absolute crazy world. Years ago this person would be in a padded room and today we put there face on beer.
I know all them exec&#39;s at A.B. are over there with the warm &quot;bout to shit yourself&quot; gut feeling losing all that money and careers.😂😂😂
Two takeaways from the Dylan Disaster:<br>1. Real men don&#39;t party with fake ladies.<br>2. Real men don&#39;t drink light beer.
"Bud should have stuck with the Clydesdale horses.  Those ads were endearing and left everyone feeling good.<br>This new ad is not only poorly written/acted, it did not target the groups who spent their dollars endorsing the product.  What the hell were they thinking???"
If I was a woman I’d be very offended. He’s making a mockery of them implying they’re a bunch of airheads that don’t know what March madness is or what sport it would be tied to. Taking the stereotypes to their unrealistic extremes
"My god , what a world… I have two kids, for crying out loud…"
"Oh boi, this will be taught in marketing classes on how NOT to run an ad campaign. At least this company will be remembered for something."
"Didn&#39;t bud have &quot;real men of genius&quot; commercials?? Bring those dudes back, we all need new beer inspired inventions for the tech world."
How many Bud Lights would you need to get excited for  Dylan?
The guy in the commercial be littled sports fans and Bud Light drinkers. Looked creepy too.
"The fact that he’s counting the number of days he’s been in ‘womanhood’ 😂 I’ve never heard a women need to say this, because, they are women. They don’t need to justify it. Get this dude some help."
Imagine being the person who brings down an empire in just 50 seconds xD
What I’ve learned: If you dress up as and act out stereotypes of a group of people you can get your mug on a beer can and it’s completely acceptable.<br><br>Following the same concept; if I paint myself black and act out black American stereotypes that’ll be completely acceptable and I too would get massive support and my face on a beer can.😜<br><br>This is the world we live in; everything is okay now. To all of the woke-minded people or “insert pronouns here” out there. 🎉 Congratulations you’re a “winner”!
It costed $400 million dollars to make this ad.....
"Bud light: “we need an idea that will connect with or main demographic, hard working middle age MEN”<br>Also Bud Light: this garbage"
"Lol Bud totally deserves all of this, god damn"
"This was almost hard to find unedited or without commentary, thanks for posting"
why is this thing still alive????
The biggest decline in drinking since prohibition.
"ive been struggling to find the original ad, thank you"
That literally took a lot of balls
Most expensive ad of all time <br>😂😂😂
"Buttweiser, King of Queers!"
I can’t believe someone at Budweiser thought this was a good idea.
I always love seeing people trying so hard to advertise me a product that can be consumed and yet in that advertisement they just barely drink (or eat) from said product.
"A commercial that will live on in infamy. Gotta go, it’s Miller time."
RIP Spuds Mackenzie
Holy shit my friends told me about this commercial. I laughed about it and kept on. I just watched it. My brother walked out and handed me an IPA with a bud light in his hand. Might be a sign.
More powerful than a AA meeting 😂
"Worse mistake, a beer company could make"
I saw a Bud Light delivery truck and someone had spray painted across the back &quot;I brake for chicks with dick&#39;s&quot; 😂
The face that sank 1000 bottles of beer...
Bud light gave all new meaning to pounding a tall boy 🤣
"I swear, people can&#39;t take a joke anymore."
I will never drink BUD again .
30 billion dollars commercial 😂😂😂
"By just making this commercial, this man not only got people to quit their alcohol addiction, but also this man even crashed a big corporation that used to make billions of dollars.<br>Edit: Edit"
this makes me want to rethink my life
This is what got yall&#39;s panties in a bunch? 😂 Not even a minute long
"I mean, seriously, even if you gave no issue with Trans, this is a terrible ad campaign. <br><br>So tone def to the market too"
<b>HOW TO RUIN A REPUTATION 101</b>
It takes balls to do this video
"Thank you for posting this. Some people were offended by this ad and others not. The people who are not offended by the ad were offended by bud light not standing behind their decision to make this ad.<br><br>The end result is Bud Light ticked everyone off. They could’ve done a stronger ad in support of LGBT issues, however, the ad doesn’t appear to strongly address that either."
Bro doesn’t even know march madness is about basketball but tries to act relatable
Wait... this was the commercial that everyone was so upset about? There is like... nothing scandalous about this.
How Fake do you want to be?<br>Dylan: Yes!
"NGL, this ad was so much tamer than I expected given the backlash 😂"
How can you in fact MAKE a Bud LIGHT? I mean the original Bud tastes like water... adding water to water is STILL just water...
And now so many are facing the unemployment line.
It&#39;s straight liquor from here on out!
What did they think was going to happen???<br>They insulted their consumer base!
"Everything else aside, I resent being called Fratty and out of touch. Miller Light is actually pretty good! 😋 I’m done with AB products."
"I don&#39;t see why there was so much commotion about this commercial.  I would guess everyone is so sensitive and defensive and easily loses their cool.<br>Not everyone is a sports fan but that&#39;s no reason to make a big deal.  Back in the day people knew not to go off the deep end over a little humor.  I get it, it&#39;s not intentional disrespect and so you shouldn&#39;t take your sports too religiously.  Lighten up.  I don&#39;t even take religion religiously, but I take beer important and celebrate all the time like her.  FYI, actually giving it up, for now at least.  ✌️💙"
49 seconds to destroy a shitty beer empire.
Good to see the world hasn’t gone completely insane
I honestly thought this was an SCTV parity. I did not think they were serious.
"Wow, giving middle fingers to all basketball fans while dividing half of your customers. Even Thanos couldn’t do that"
This add would have cost next to nothing to make. But didnt it cost them millions 🤣🤣
"This is a guy just putting on a dress and being like &quot;Women be petty and ignorant AF, yo!&quot;<br>It&#39;s really misogynist.   And actually traditional."
"wait i don&#39;t get it, I saw Millers and it was stupid as hell but can someone explain to me what&#39;s wrong with this one? (Also guys don&#39;t flame me but I aint a sports guy either so idk what March Madness means, you literally have to jingle keys at my face for me to understand)...."
Is it possible to fire the person who came up with this idea one thousand times?
That man never drank duff in his life.
"Never drank budlight in my life,I always drink Coors light now all my buddies are drinking it too 🤣🤣🤣🤣"
"I actually kinda feel sorry for dylan. I watched this promo fifty times &#39; and thoroughly dissected it. And i find that it was the company&#39;s fault for making him include the phrase womanhood&#39; that kinda insulted a sane persons common sense. Other than that , i thought he was funny actually. The other beer companys have gotten a hands on spanking on what not to do. Js"
Beer = Big gut. Don&#39;t drink the stuff :)
I had one budweiser at a bar about a month ago. Never again.
HE&#39;S my pick in the Deadpool every year now!
"I just recently learned about this ad, and I gotta say that I can kind of see why people think the way that they do. If anything the marketing team was just too politicized and incompetent.<br><br>Look, I can see that the goal was to target sexual minorities to sell expand the customer base, but the large part of the customer base was probably ticked off by the focus being on someone’s celebration of their transition and this advertisement being, in a half-assed way, linked to march madness. Some people also say that this person (Dylan is her name?) has an audience which includes a decent amount of minors. It is highly inappropriate to do advertising via her channel in that case.<br><br>So, whether right or wrong, a company has a customer base, and ideally, they should respect that customer base. Some people disliked the advertisement. Alright, so stop taking that advertisement route and do it in a more honest and less provocative manner next time (after a long while). Apologize and do advertisement strategies that appeal to everyone or most people.<br><br>And this is the issue: if bud light’s marketing team was honest about doing their work, they would do the above and actually submit to their customer base looking to continue to increase their company’s sales. A wrong thing to do would be to proceed to say that your customers are out of touch. That’s not marketing. That’s politicization, and a bitter aggression against the majority of your consumer base for not being politically brainwashed into accepting anything that is pro-gayism.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with gay people. However, there is something wrong about expecting everyone to feel the same way about gay people being promoted as gay people and leaving the beer as a secondary promotion while the collaboration should be secondary to the product.<br><br>Some people will like the ad, some people will dislike the ad, and some people don’t care either way. It’s disgusting to expect everyone to think the same way. It just doesn’t make sense, and it would be biased to say anything else other than “Anheuser-Busch’s marketing team is bad at marketing and political maniacs.”<br><br>By the way, I would say this if it went the other way, but there’s usually a “progressive” skew to these advertisement regressions. Companies should respect their customers or crumble. They exist only because the people work hard (most of the time) and spend their money on said products. Customers are venerable. And companies can only have a little bit of that venerability if they acknowledge that."
This is the new face of sobriety.
We&#39;re living in a Mike Judge movie.
This dude tanked a whole company . That&#39;s wild.
"AND Because of this man dressed as an embarrasing clown with an embarrasing message,there goes the entire Bud Light Company. You can&#39;t make this crap up! LOL"
Okay so this person saying hey I&#39;m an alcoholic I want a drink for any reason.
Miller lite is laughing all the way to the bank…..😂
The most expensive ad of all time
"hey dude,mam,sir,Mis,boy,girl,bro  whatever your smile looks totally fake,"
"If you were drinking Bud Light before this whole debacle, your opinions on social issues are not valid."
She broke the legs of every Clydesdale.
This year’s #1 Halloween costumes
I can’t believe that people let this trigger them so much.  This just proves that we have a nation of emotionally immature people.  🤷🏻‍♂️🙄🤦🏻‍♂️
"The lesson here is, too much Bud Light might make you think this is a woman"
I’ll take Miller light
Down goes Bud Light 😂
Wow!! Never drinking Bud again!!
GO SPORTS BALL TEAM! <br><br>😬 how TF could anyone from the top approve this to go out?… it’s just so cringey..
"So this is the Dude that killed Bud light,Awesome"
"I&#39;m a lumberjack, and I&#39;m alright<br>I work all day and I drink Bud light<br>He&#39;s a lumberjack, and he&#39;s alright<br>he works all day and he drinks Bud light<br>I cut down trees, I eat my lunch<br>I go to the lavatory<br>On Wednesdays I go shoppin&#39;<br>And have buttered scones for tea<br>He cuts down trees, he eats his lunch<br>He goes to the lavatory<br>On Wednesdays he goes shoppin&#39;<br>And has buttered scones for tea<br>I&#39;m a lumberjack, and I&#39;m alright<br> I work all day and I drink Bud light<br>I cut down trees, I skip and jump<br>I like to press wild flowers<br>I put on women&#39;s clothing<br>And hang around in bars<br>He cuts down trees, he skips and jumps<br>He likes to press wild flowers<br>He puts on women&#39;s clothing<br>And hangs around in bars<br>I&#39;m a lumberjack, and I&#39;m alright<br>I work all day and I drink Bud light<br>I cut down trees, I wear high heels<br>Suspendies, and a bra<br>I wish I&#39;d been a girlie<br>Just like my dear Papa"
"I think all the fuss about this was stupid AF and after watching the video cringy as it is I still feel that way, but holy shit is this lady creepy. She low key remind me of that momo challenge woman that parents we’re freaking out about a few years ago 😂"
Miller light or another brand should of made an ad of him where he drinks their beverage and he becomes a man again have his mom and dad crying of joy could get into more detail but I’d already be surprised if this stay up they could of had some fun with it
"I got tired of watching Budweiser commercial, I miss the Frogs and Lizards and the Real Men of Genius commercials those always crack me up. <br>Budweiser has gone soft...... Literally"
I sleep well at night knowing that the woke lady who was responsible for this will probably never work in marketing again. This will follow her forever.
What a freak show 😂😂😂 definitely not drinking budwiser ever againnn bruh
This guy is a real freak show.
What’s more hilarious is the number of people so bent out of shape about a commercial for the shittiest beer imaginable 😂 who even cares if they’re trans. This controversy has arguably made this the best Bud Light ad of recent years 😂
Homosexuals and lesbian repent Of your sins Jesus christ is coming soon
You blew it Budweiser <br><br>No more!
ONE trans made ONE commercial and ruined the company. how does that happen?
This is British comedian Kenny Everett&#39;s &#39;Cupid Stunt&#39; character in real life.
"I can&#39;t hate Dylan Mulvaney for this. They got offered a ton of money to endorse Bud Light (for whatever reason) and they clearly don&#39;t drink Bud Light or know anything about sports, but they said of course I&#39;ll take the money. They then made this outrageously gay commercial and probably forgot all about it until it came out. Now everyone is angry. Don&#39;t hate the player, hate the insane demonic game. I don&#39;t like Dylan and wouldn&#39;t want to be near them, but this is Bud Light&#39;s problem. They are the ones who chose to use them."
Bud bowl commercials where the best during Super Bowl! That’s all I have to say about this!
The 50 seconds that cost them billions       Keep it up people don’t buy this shit
"They wanted to be the trans beer, now they are.  Mission complete."
Beer has a lot of estrogen. So I think the comercial really tells you what will happen if you still drink beer.
"Even if the target audience was trans, this doesn’t even seem like an appealing or well planned commercial."
"bc of this, they&#39;ve lost 6 billion dollars in profit and it hasn&#39;t stop. Way to go!!!"
"Never drinking bud again, though I never had to begin with."
A guy posing as a woman and a beer posing as a real beer
"That commercial is just weird, regardless of the other stuff."
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
It’s Miller time 😂
It’s not a knock against Dylan. But Budweiser will never be purchased by me again. Ever.
Can we get back to the dilly dilly guys or the bud wei ser frogs
Imagine how mad stock investors are at the young man!
I love watching this commerical....shows me how  really stupid some people can be.......did you see the one where he thinks he&#39;s a possum ????
"I&#39;m not from the US, but I had heard bits and pieces about a controversial beer ad that had caused outrage and resulting sales losses. All these months later I thought I&#39;d watch whatever this travesty of an ad was all about. Finally I watch it and I fully laughed. This benign little thing set off so much havok? Wow, I expected a guy lighting puppies on fire and throwing them into a petrol soaked orphanage. But this. This is what gets the US up in arms? You guys are wound up way too tight!"
"What tripped me out was this mindset tbh. Let’s give this person millions of dollars to campaign a beer known to have huge sales for March madness, be totally clueless about what March madness is? Smh that’s insane"
Imagine thinking using a pedophile playing pretend as your spokesperson is sound marketing.
"If a person is free to announce their &quot;gender preferred&quot; pronoun, I am equally free to refer to them with the pronoun of my choice, which may reflect their original gender or their current gender. If for any reason either of us loses that, then we have lost a basic constitutional right."
"I&#39;m a Baby Boomer, so I come from a time in Americana where men were men and women did there best to be great wives, mothers and homemakers!<br><br>Everyone&#39;s roles were very defined. And then it seems that around 1977 when disco was big with partying, coke and lot&#39;s of sex, a lot more infidelity was just a side effect. Then more and more people started living together and more divorces. After this,  people coming out as gay was the big thing, and NOW women trying to be men and men trying to be women!<br><br>I feel for all you young people that didn&#39;t get to grow up at a time when parents, though unhappy, sometimes really strove to keep a good family unit together in behalf of the kids. A time when we played OUTSIDE, our Mom&#39;s made us lunch, we ate together as a family and for some, they waited for their Dad to come home to get SPANKED with a belt. 😅 Everyone knew the rules and there was very little back talk.<br><br>So for me to observe such upheaval, and a time when not only do women not want to be viewed as a &quot;homemaker&quot; but rather a successful &quot;influencer business person&quot; that travels to exotic places, dines out at the finest restaurants, wears designer clothes, fly&#39;s on private jets, wears expensive jewelry....that men subsidize, it&#39;s all just so foreign to me. This world is so messed up and ya&#39;ll have NO FRAME OF REFERENCE! How would you know better cause this was the world that your generations were born into!<br><br>So with this.... man/woman to have a following, it is what it is. I did sales and marketing for years and so I get that they were going after a specific market share by letting those people know that they appreciate their business.<br><br>Now if this ad had been directed to the MASSES.... then I would understand the uproar. I&#39;m not into their lifestyle but that is them. So if he/she has a following that is in agreement with her then I get that they did this for them. <br><br>I will NEVER accept trans AND Gay stuff being PUSHED on me as being NORMAL, but as long as they don&#39;t try to INFLUENCE or PROMOTE it to kids, then we need to let them live their lives. Many people HATE Black people (not sure why, when we are the ones that were used as slaves, beaten raped, families broken up, lynched, harassed by police, punished more severely by judges, denied government programs like the GI Bill, denied Home, Business and Mortgage loans to get out of the slums that the Government literally made for us while making white construction company&#39;s rich, denied equal scooling, illegally used for medical tests. And many of YOU have what, reason to hate US? But that&#39;s another discusion).<br><br>I say that to say, that it would be so awesome to &quot;turn our color off&quot; just so that we could be treated like everyone else!!! But we CAN&#39;T. So I don&#39;t feel a lot of sympathy for the Gay or LGBT community to be crying over not being treated like everyone else. They DON&#39;T have to choose to put it in people&#39;s faces.We don&#39;t have a choice cause many of you make up your mind about me as soon as you lay your eye&#39;s on me without knowing that I could very well be the funniest cool buddy of yours! So sad.<br><br>Sorry for getting off track. Bottom line is that unless you feel the need to CHOOSE to follow this individuals profile, fucking let it go, it has nothing to do with YOU or with a company trying to expand it&#39;s market share.  Or are you going to boycott any grocery stores where they shop, as well??? Are you?<br><br>This world is so messed up, so all you can do is try to be the best person you can be and associate with people that are like minded. If your other buddies are also racist then stick with them and continue to poison one another with your triggered nonsense. And I know that you will like that I used the word &quot;TRIGGER&quot; cause it&#39;s reminds you of the word... not so fast! 😂<br><br>Anyways, best wishes to everyone including, these unique people, Anheuser-Busch, and even you guys that hate me for no valid reason! 😊<br><br>Side note. I am allowed to ramble cause I&#39;m old. And don&#39;t forget, there was a time where many sporting events were boycotted because blacks were gonna be allowed to play in the game."
&quot;Welcome to the insane world of wokeness!&quot;
"I don&#39;t even drink beer and I found that repulsive somehow. <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/YvgfY-LIBpjChgHKyYCQBg""></a>"
"Even as an advert without the controversy, it&#39;s just terrible 😂"
How to lose $1 billion in less than a year:
I mean if you drink light beer you are already half way there
So what was you 367 days ago
"Imagine seeing this and getting so insulted that you have to tell everyone you&#39;re switching to a different brand of beer. It&#39;s like, do these people really have such uninteresting lives that &quot;boycotting&quot; a beer company is something worth their time? Here&#39;s a fun fact: probably every major beer company has at least one transgender employee, so that&#39;s your cue to stop being an alcoholic redneck"
Thanks for the ad Dylan. Won&#39;t be drinking this brand again.
Sometimes all you need is 40 seconds to take down an empire 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is a caricature of womanhood.
"I’m a straight, non-leftist man and even I know that that’s an offensive caricature of woman. In 365 days of womanhood, you discovered that the beauty of what makes a woman a woman is being ditzy and not knowing something pretty common knowledge about sports? I’m the one that’s seen as bigoted because I don’t support this person, yet I’m the one offended on behalf of women that he thinks this what it means to be a woman."
Is the first time that a marketing campaign convince me instantly to reject what is trying to sell.
ay dylan should appear in more beer ads lol she already did better than prohibition.
WELL I THINK HE DID A GREAT JOB!! <br><br>😤 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>😂
I think Bud Light was trying to say look he only has five cans. He’s one can shy of a six pack. 😂
I&#39;M A LADY CAN&quot;T YOU NOT SEE I&#39;M A LADY????
Why is this dude dressed up as a chick?
"I wish, after seeing this commercial, that my husband would boycott Budweiser( hecould cut down).. he couldn’t care less even if the devil himself was promoting it! Tbh, I was expecting something much more vulgar ; like Dylan doing a strip dance while chugging a Bud light… a lot of “guys” got their panties in a knot for a trans person promoting beer?! Who cares!🤷🏻‍♀️"
Faaaak when he smiles he looks the main witch from the movie witches
"&quot;To say of what is, that it is not or of what is not, that it is - is false. And to say of what is, that it is, and of what is not, that it is not  - is true&quot;  - Aristotle, Correspondence Theory of Truth<br><br>If you have a hard time believing in the Aristotelian model for truth (philosophy), you&#39;re the reason why this nonsense exists."
"I don’t hate anybody but if Bud Light was going to legitimately support LGBTQ, I’d like to think that they could have done a hell of a lot better than this. I mean all BS aside, look at the presentation. This looks like it’s marketed directly towards elementary school students. Associating alcohol and sexuality with children is not okay. I can vividly recall the Bud Light commercials from the 90’s when I was a kid and it showed a frog with its tongue out sticking to the back of the beer truck. We all laughed at it. Since then they’ve had pretty mainstream and lame commercials. That didn’t really matter at the end of the day because they had neat merchandise, bowling pin shaped bottles, and a decent product. Now, those old neon signs and clocks are going for dirt cheap. This just wasn’t a very good commercial from any perspective."
The queen of beers
I never thought someone would single handedly destroy budlight. This chick had the BALLS to do it 😂
"And just like that, millions of blue collar workers across the nation said, &quot;Nah.&quot;"
Bud&#39;s lite went out
Our local AA has started using this ad to help addicts quit
Straight up painful to watch
Bud light sucks anyway
"If you are offended by this business, then do not buy their product. But,  nobody has a right, to condemn, harass, insult, mock, and terrify another human being. Let God judge. As a Christian,this really breaks my heart. I used to live this lifestyle, until Jesus set me free by his love. I pray the same for Dylan.<br><br>&quot; If you, O LORD, kept track of iniquities, then who, O Lord, could stand?&quot;<br><br>                      God loves you Dylan, you are not alone."
These people need to grow up and see they were just trying to broaden their audience into the LGBTQ+ community!
"Why would anyone be so upset watching this that it would cause a boycott?<br>If you don&#39;t like it, give it an eye roll and move on"
This dude is creepy.
What&#39;s sup bro?
Bud Light Then: 🗿😎🍷<br><br>Bud Light Now: 🤡🤢🤮<br><br>Bud Light has Become Woke Disney!
We all know how this ended...
This disgusted me
"I&#39;ve always thought that the United States is too immersed in political correctness, but when I saw the comments, that prejudice disappeared."
What is this &quot;oh-I&#39;m-a-woman-so-I-have-to-be-sports-stupid&quot; bs?
66th Grammy Awards will may be sponsored by Bud Light!! And I would boycott them too not just the UFC!!
Those beer cans are obviously empty!
I just realized this dude must be trying to look like the Audrey actress from Breakfeast at Tiffany&#39;s
Yeah if you don’t like the ad that’s fine but there is literally nothing about this that you need to be complaining or boycotting. It’s literally just a beer commercial trying to sale nothing else. You have to be a real cry baby or fragile person if you make a big thing out of this.
How to destroy your company in 2023 101
this stopped ppl drinking more than prohibition did back then
I used to drink bud light but now I drink Polish vodka.
Don&#39;t hold my beer. He/She/They/Them are holding it.
"This guy lost Bud light 30 billion dollars.  Also got many Bud light beer drinkers to switch brands.  It will take Bud years to recover, even if they do."
"If Dylan was intelligent, he/she/we/they would have shorted the Bud Light stock before recording this video. No matter how committed you are to a cause, you can still see the outcome from a mile away. Would have made more money than Hindenburg."
"Finally, I watched this after the controversy has died down, and I&#39;m surprised how tame this was? I was expecting a full blown commercial advocating for trans rights, showing weird looking men in drag, although maybe you could say Dylan fits that description, but still, I&#39;m talking game stop Ma&#39;am type shit. I&#39;ve seen worse holiday commercials from the likes of Hillshare farms, Tyson, and various other Turkey and Ham companies around Thanksgiving and Christmas that put this to shame. Honestly, for all the outrage around this person and Bud Light, I&#39;m kind of disappointed."
The Perfomist is kinda overdoing acting ngl
video should be called how to destroy a name brand in less than a minute
Imagine the value of that empty (or full) can of bud when it appears on ebay
"Just goes to show that if you&#39;re In marketing, you can&#39;t afford to be out of touch with reality."
<b>THREW ALL MY</b> 🍻 <b>DOWN THE</b> 🚽
Keep your bud lights guy
I’m 14 I can’t even drink and I hate bud light already
Who’s here after what Planet Fitness did?
What if hes just a super troll playing 8d chess and hes taking down brands for the fun of it
Lmao what? How was everyone so offended over this? Hilarious how the right side says the left is so easily offended when this made them lose their minds lmao
I honestly don&#39;t even mind the commercial. It&#39;s the pandering that companies do cash in on the latest trend. It&#39;s sickening.
Getting over the obvious cringe this commercial is… i think one of the more unspoken cringier things is him acting like a lot of girls don’t know what March madness is at the beginning
"Seriously, why do people always talk shit but never talk about they feel. It doesn&#39;t feel like the wokeness is the problem. It feels like people are using their trans status as excuse to bully them instead of just telling them that the way the ad is presented just comes off ignorant. Seriously, why is bullying and the norm instead of proper feedback."
"With all the talk about this, I really though they were going full woke, with rainbow cans and transgender discounts or something. I don&#39;t get it this isn&#39;t even close to what netflix and countless others are doing. While I couldn&#39;t be further from ever sideing with lgbt stuff, I see no issue in whomever to drink shit beer and even promote it."
"I don’t get why people are so mad about this. Yea, it’s obviously a company that has too much money to give a fuck about what gender someone is, but you see that with all companies now, so I don’t think bud light should get any hate for it"
"When the boycott began, i asked anyone to give me their Bud light cans they dont want anymore, since then i have not spent a penny on buying BL and have even sold quite a few six packs to people who don&#39;t give a fuck about this dude sponsorship, all they care for is the beer, and i recovered quite some money from the beer I bought before this boycott, and i still have lots of BL stocked."
"Putting aside anything about trans people, the ad is just... bad. I thought that it might at least be something creative, or at least not look like a video some random shot on their iPhone. They couldn&#39;t do better?"
Im just curious about what this Bud Light boycott is more over? The fact they asked a transgender person to do well what i would not call an ad or the fact they put Dylan Mulvaneys image on 1 can which is a souvernier can for Mulvaney alone?
"ahhh, the old &quot;im a woman, i know nothing about sports, tee hee!&quot; it&#39;s insulting. <br>For a community that doesn&#39;t like stereotyping and labeling, they certainly do a lot of it."
So people are boycotting Bud Light just because they hired a trans woman to promote their beer?<br><br>Is it correct or did I miss something?<br><br>And bullying someone for basically nothing is beyond disgusting.<br>It seems people lost their hearts and souls. I don&#39;t understand at all why y&#39;all so mean to her.
Only thing that can top this is if NASCAR paints gay flags on their cars. Has to be the biggest advertising disaster in history lol
Schools will teach kids that this was actually a brilliant marketing campaign destroyed by conservatives. However your economics professor will call bullshit and call it what it is. A terrible idea.
"I know this is just a reupload and that you are not that man, but man I can&#39;t stop myself from disliking this"
"Why does he sound that egoistic, when he is mocking march madness ?<br>You get a deal with a large brand, and you talk about yourself ? 😂"
So cringey that &quot;she&quot; has &quot;no knowledge of sports&quot; like some stereotype.<br>Everyone knows March Madness means basketball. AND I&#39;M A GAY BOY.
Oh no a bucnh of cranky old men and highschool drop outs are mad 😢
Why did bud light pick dylan as the face of their brand? Instead of doing rainbow cans like previous years?
"As much as I dislike Mulvaney, this ad is really nothing compared to the anti-male, anti-white racist Gillette branding campaign of 2019.  It&#39;s a shame that this one-off TikTok video sparked the backlash that Gillette should have suffered."
"Who should&#39;ve made billions? Would be Mary Tyler Moore , but unfortunately shes not with us 😢 by the way did he try 2 look like her ?"
"More than anything, I&#39;m surprised someone thought a good commercial would be a portrait mode video with some random person pretending to be ignorant about a sports tournament featuring athletes who mostly aren&#39;t old enough to consume the product being promoted."
"I’ve heard the crying for months and had to know for myself. Wow, so that’s it? Disappointed head shake boys.  The forecast is calling for snow"
Who’s on first? What’s on second. And I don’t know what the fluck is going on in third. 🤪🤪🤪
"It&#39;s a terrible ad, but that&#39;s what people got upset over? You&#39;re not a real man if this offended you."
All it took was two  people to destroy an iconic brand. One man (Dylan Mulvaney) and one woman (Alissa Horseface).
"Really mind boggling that THIS is THE ad, looks like she herself set up the camera filmed a short &amp; the whole ass corporation ran it?! Plus so many odd and questionable nuances in the spew of words 🤡☠"
wait… i’m genuinely confused. not even being sarcastic when i ask: is THIS the ad that made everyone boycott bud light???
Just apologize and this boycott would be over but as long as you are so self involved you will keep going down the tubes…
I’m 44 and I’m never gonna get drunk on bud light again I’m throwing that shit away
Guys we are gay now nah nah jk but bro they be saying u gay if u drink this
I&#39;ll come every year to laugh at this again. I prep myself by reading the &quot;2023 Bud Light boycott&quot; wikipedia article to make it even funnier.
Still don’t understand problem with that (i‘m German and beero-holic)
Saved cans maybe worth something historically in a 100 years
Budweiser has joined the Freakshow. Go Woke Go Broke. Good riddance
This was when Bud Light decided to be the Queen of Beers 🍺!!! 🤣😂😅😂🤣
One can killed my favorite beer brand now I’m a Modelo drinker and coors
"Wow, he did better than the prohibition ever could have."
Queer killed this beer
Imagine it being viewed as more manly to drink sparkling strawberry wine than a bud light or bud lol
"Now it&#39;s BUTT Light, not Bud Light anymore."
This is the shit that makes me not want to exist lol 💀
It took me 5 minutes to find this video. Its being suppressed lmao
Thank you for this ad its honestly made me quit drinking
The commercial will live in infamy.
So this was the commercial that offended millions???
This foo looks like he’s forcing himself to drink it😂
As a walmart bag I am offended by this commercial😒
Worst commercial ever stop this madness now!!!!
I wonder how many more sponsorshipsDylan will get
"A parody of a woman, a mockery of women"
The person in charge of commercial advertising at Bud company who choose dylan and trans concept must be fired and ban forever
aint even a minute long and people got so mad...
Nonce ad I&#39;ll never drink bud light again
If this is what my son has to grow up seeing. Then this generation of people is truely the worst of all time. Any other country in this world can do better then this. Anyone. Ill say it again. Anything can do better then this. One last time. A blade of grass has more value then this person.
Thought it was way worse 😂 like who cares
"Congrats for grounding such a big beer brand alone. Btw, you had 0 days of womanhood, so there&#39;s really nothing to celebrate."
the worst mistake a company has ever made
Budweiser went from &quot;Real Men of Genius&quot; to &quot;Fake Females with Penis&quot; in 50 Seconds.
Мужик в маске женщины делает пародию на обезьяну и пьет пиво?
"What strikes me most about this ad is how very very cheap it looks, and apparently unscripted and utterly witless. &quot;Whatever team you love I love&quot;--dear God. Someone on the inside must have wanted to really screw the company."
"Okay, I must be dumb, whats wrong with this? xD"
This is the entirety of the original commercial?
Bud wasn&#39;t Wiser. Go Broke fools.
Your not supposed to drink that anymore ☝🏾
NOPE to WOKE! Bud Light = 🤢🤮💩
What&#39;s worse then piss water gay piss water
Sad that Dylan did not know what March Madness was.
This is pathetic. BL deserves this backlash.
the way this dude drink the beer is ridiculous🤬
"Like pitching Bud Light cans that say &quot;Go Yankees&quot; to the Boston, Fenway park neighborhood."
This is a commercial??
My liver thanks you
You know.  I think that if Dylan was actually attractive or looked more like a girl people wouldn&#39;t be so pissed about this.  When I found out Dylan was picked by a female I wasn&#39;t surprised.  You need a trans woman who makes straight men question their sexuality.  I recommend Bailey Jay.
We gotta make sure that dipship VP never finds a job as a McDonalds janitor ever again
I dont see what the problem is honestly. If your going to stop drinking Budwiser because of an image on a beer can than you are a weak minded person. Just because R. Kelly did what he did didnt stop me from listening to his music. Or with Michael Jackson. I also loved the Cosby Show and I still do. People are stupid and are always looking for reasons to lash out.
I got into this way too soon. What is it with bud light and this commercial?? Someone please explain.
"I don&#39;t get this add. Even if you leave the politics out of it, what the hell is the viewer supposed to get from it? Literally nothing of substance is said"
What happened to the marketing team who came up with this advert? Were they fired??
Why dress for the opera house to &quot;pre game&quot;
what a mentalist needs to be put in a ward
This man killed bud light
I don’t believe he’s a woman but I don’t see what upset so many people about this...
The voice reeks of XY chromosomes
Why does his face look like that
he reminds me of hanks wife in breaking bad
Maybe this was a secret message from the ceo meaning if you keep drinking bud light you will be like dylan in the future
"Thanks Dylan, I&#39;m never drinking this piss ever again"
What in the name of Jehovah is this ?
That guy is weird
Bud Light to Modelo
Why does it look like a bobblehead?
"Wow. I&#39;m a female (and I always have been... and I always will be... barring any future reincarnation... but you know what I mean), and I know that March Madness is basketball. I always do a bracket! How offensive is this implication that women are idiots about sports? Granted, I&#39;m not a basketball fan, and I do the bracket for fun, but come on, who doesn&#39;t know about March Madness? And if you were a man until a year ago, you really should&#39;ve known about March Madness! Dude, become a man again and learn about sports! Please!"
I don’t get the outrage over this video
GO WOKE- GO BROKE...
They need to fire Dylan.
We don&#39;t do this here
"I will be 100%<br>Dylan here from this specific angle does not look like some monster who steals kids and eats their skin to stay young, and their voice doesn&#39;t have the insufferable pitch it usually does. Good job audio editor, camera guy and makeup dep"
"No bud, no lgbt."
Go woke go broke lol
That&#39;s a demon
This is what started all that drama this wasn&#39;t even a minute long people chose a dumb hill to die on
Go woke go broke
He&#39;s such a cutie. Would eat.
Never buying it
"The best way to destroy a business is promote these things and success is guaranteed. Sexual preferences , religion preferences shouldn’t be used on a product used by everyone. Target is being screwed nicely to ."
Wow wtf. 🤮
"We need to immediately Check the horse barns and assure the safety of the horses in the barn.  No tellin, what AB is up too we should also make it like guns it’s a AB free zone,Schools Hospitals, Court Rooms, Bars, Back Yards, grassy knolls, ooo yea, Los Vegas!!!"
This looks more like a TikTok video more than a commercial.
This video cost 80 billion dollars.
This is why people are mad? I don&#39;t get it.
"What is the problem? The beer tastes the same, but now a bunch of fjollor have problems.<br><br>Beer commercials have made fun of people for many years."
"Its getting close to  Holidays and Me and my family drank Budweiser  had a trip planned for Disney,  shopped at Target, watched NFL and MLB games  Everything is done now These Woke companies like Kellogg&#39;s don&#39;t need   our families money I guess. I am done with them all. Will shop at mom and pop stores and drink Coors,  and watch my dogs play while fishing and camping."
Plot twist: the guy who hired Dylan M. and promoted this ads is actually Miller light´s manager infiltrated in Bud headquarters in disguise
"dude what a weird commercial....what were they thinking. its not even about having this guy in the commercial, its just a bad commercial regardless of whether its a trans dude or straight dude"
...this is what made people so mad? 😂😂😂
"This is the commercial that is destroying Bud Light?<br>I don&#39;t get it. All I see is someone making a clown out of themselves. If you&#39;re making an ad, one would think you&#39;d research the content of the ad, instead of making the ad all about your ignorance of sports and yourself.<br>How did nobody flag this before it made it to market?"
It’s kind of like watching the “Straight Dave” scene at the end of Bruno play out in real life for months on end lol
It takes girls 18 years to become a woman but you become a women just after a thought....... Mental illness is serious.  I hope he gets the help he needs
Dylan is like - I don&#39;t give a f about your interests. Buy beer
"Jiop <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVGDPlG42bU&amp;t=49"">0:49</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVGDPlG42bU&amp;t=49"">0:49</a>"
Now ‘Real Gone’ song needs to change it’s lyrics
He also ruined the liver transplant industry…….
"No, people weren&#39;t &quot;offended&quot; by this. They found it laughable and pathetic pandering."
Miller sitting back like “yesssss come to the dark side”
"In 5 years, we’ll find out that Dylan received a million dollar donation from Alcoholics Anonymous"
"Sky Australia News coined the phrase, “Go Woke, go Broke! I highly doubt that Bud Light would be willing to try it again!"
Women don’t talk/ act like that. Flipped like three different stereotypes of women in one commercial….how isn’t that offensive to feminists.
One has to wonder what that can will be worth in 50 years
THIS is the commercial? Anti climactic af. I love it when the population shows exactly how much power they truly have but of all things that have been going in recently the fact that this is the turning point is funny to me
This guy went through all the trouble to change gender becomes a woman and for what for man&#39;s pleasure? What women role in the world?
"Budwiser before: &quot;Bud&quot; &quot;WISE&quot;&quot;ER&quot;<br><br>Budwiser now: &quot;Bud&quot; &quot;EXCUSE ME, ITS MAM!&quot;"
&quot;oh gee im a &#39;woman&#39; so of course i dont know anything about sports or anything&quot;...btw why is his name still Dylan?

If a beer company targets the wrong community of their woke madness 😅....
"the stock price hit it&#39;s lowest in JUNE at $53 when this manufactured controversy happened in april the stock price was roughly at $62 in APRIL the stock price now is up to $64, yep they reallllllllllllllllllly felt that boycott."
Dylan Mulvaney Vs Juaquin&#39;s  Joker
The boycott wouldn&#39;t have been as successful as it was if Bud Light didn&#39;t taste like aged piss water taken from a football stadium during the Super Bowl. People are giving Dylan Mulvaney too much credit I think.
The agenda is fkn itself. ❤😂😂
Oh my god THIS is what every body is so mad about??? Jesus Christ😭😭😭😭. Yall I am a woman and though I don’t speak for all- pretty sure you just wanted a reason to be transphobic. So we’re gonna act like all trans women misunderstood girlhood because one popular trans creator made ONE offhand joke???? Seriously??? Also can we stop blaming HER for “destroying” Bud light? How about addressing the millions of transphobic people who just don’t like her or trans people. 🤦‍♀️
Congratulations To Bud Light For Successfully Destroying Your Brand!
Probably going to have to change the name of the beer to BUTT Light.....just saying!!!!!!
"&quot;Impressive carrying skills, right?&quot; Well, you have man hands, because ... you&#39;re a MAN, so... No, not impressive."

"Even leaving aside the identity politics mess... this is cringy. Like, you know those jokes in The Simpsons where Krusty has a prerecorded speech saying &quot;I wholeheartedly approve of the mentioned product or service&quot;? It feels like that.

This thing should  get so drunk it kill it self
The best ever Transheuser-Busch commercial.
What&#39;s insulting was Dylan didn&#39;t know what March Madness means and what team to support. It&#39;s sports related and he/she should have known what it was. I don&#39;t know much about sports but people get mad about that especially beer-loving sports fanatics.
"Pride month? Sure, it’d make sense, but the Final Four is sacred to some people, especially alumni’s ts and most sports fans like myself aren’t offended by transgenderism, just turned off by putting up a person that knows nothing of sports, and the celebration of someone that participated in the eradication of women’s events like……NCAA women’s basketball which was actually 10 times more exciting than any WNBA games lol. The only sport where a man can simply identify as a woman, step on the court and dominate a group of young women that worked their whole lives to get into that position."
Anheiser&#39;s only road to recovery....<br>Bring back the wazzzaaap boyz
"Andheiser Busch is in America&#39;s rear view mirror. Nothing more than a distant memory!!<br>GO WOKE, GO BROKE!!!"
As of this POST - BUD has lost over 25% market share - Thousands of people laid off from their jobs - and RETAILERS are making space for other products...
It&#39;s a cute commercial.  But the powers that be clealry didn&#39;t know who their consumer was.<br>This would have been a fun soda or juice commercial.
"It&#39;s wild how all the think pieces and articles made people think that this was some kind of nationally syndicated commercial, instead of one single partnered video on Dylan Mulvaney&#39;s TikTok, which, unless you already watch trans influencers regularly,  you probably never would have seen unless you went searching for it"
What a real man of genius this individual is amirite
This is so innocent and harmless. Just wow
This video is like someone sparking a match
That looks like a student project lol
Been hearing about this for months and finally sought this commercial out and...<br>It&#39;s boringly tame lol.
"Who gave this ad the green light? Honestly, zero awareness of their brand or their customer base."
Not the first time Buds done this folks.. except Spuds Mackenzie was a female dog presented as a Male... but I gotta ask didn&#39;t anyone at Corporate think of doing a private screening to judge how consumers might react??
i&#39;ll never drink a bud again i suere
That pathetic can with his face on it is hilarious. Most expensive can ever made.
Certified hood classic
This aged like fine excrement 👏🏻👍🏻🙌🏻
"When you&#39;re doing a BudLight commercial, you got to have lifted white trucks full of Mexicans out on a ranch, a couple rancheros walk out holding onto a wooden fence, discussing jovially in Spanish about a days wild happenings, they hold onto an old rickity fence, a can of BudLight in their free hand, while watching another ranchero ride a crazy horse rodeostyle. &quot;Hey you crazy loco, you ride a horse like an Americano!&quot; They giggle, the camera pans to show a can of icy BudLight near a wooden post, the ranchero on his horse in a blur behind it.  Guaranteed massive BudLight Commercial Appeal!😂"
"Bud Light will bounce back, people are fickle. The image of this person trying to enjoy beer will last a lifetime."
"to sell their beer, they brought it to Russia despite the sanctions. I laughed hysterically when I saw the budlight in the village store."
The commercial mocks the sports fan. Trivialises their support of a team. How is that likely to help sales when the beer company is mocking the consumer that might ordinarily like to enjoy a beer with their mates after a hard weeks work?
"😜😝😝😝Nach einer Werbekampagne mit Transgender-Influencerin Dylan Mulvaney ist der Umsatz der US-Biermarke Bud Light stark eingebrochen. Dies, weil landesweit zum Boykott aufgerufen wurde.....<br><br>Hahahahaaa,ich gönn es denen..."
Have just watched the commercial for the first time and I am stunned. It is absolutely pathetic. It is so amateurish and the resulting boycott is understandable. Who on earth would ever think they have got a winner there.
Bud Light has fell from number 1 after 20 yrs. number one Beer - a Mexican brand dethroned them
"My frustration is that we are being told that we should educate ourselves and not be ignorant to their views… yet she can’t take the time to know what is March Madness and at least pretend she likes sports if she’s going to sell us on a product. As always, double standard smh."
"Bud Light used to be a beer for truckers.<br>So, it makes sense to have a lot lizard advertising it."
RIP BUD LIGHT   The ceo is responsable for this dizaster
"Not even drinking it either, as a professional at this, at that angle Dylan maybe got a teaspoon at most of beer"
"Well, well, well, people offended. Imagine that"
Pride. Where brands go to die.
This man ruined bud light for good. Be honest when’s the last time you’ve seen someone have that after the commercial?
this is the commercial...
wow. In hindsight watching this is like watching the titanic sink from a small boat whilst eating popcorn.
It was never a commercial. It was an Instagram post.
SNL couldn&#39;t have done it better 😅
"If you&#39;re reading this, chances are it&#39;s for your Influencer Marketing college class. Looks like you&#39;re on the What Not To Do chapter. Best of luck this semester!"
Anyone remember the funny bud light commercials of the 90s? They should have stuck with that.
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it drinks the beer again
"&quot;Do you just wake up in morning and think, holy s**t I&#39;m going to be a tumor today?&quot; ~Filthy Frank"
"I had to pause at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVGDPlG42bU&amp;t=26"">0:26</a>, no particular reason, just that I couldn’t breath the moment the video played"
"Get Woke, Go Broke! <br>🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮<br>😂😂😂😂😂😂"
Women don&#39;t even buy Bud light like that..<br>So they chose a transgender that thinks he is a adolescent little girl. How dangerous is that to children. People aren&#39;t just mad you change the beer. you chose a man in women&#39;s attire who thinks he&#39;s an underage girl. And you think I&#39;m going to have my kids around that insanity.<br>He needs a therapist . I took my time to look this person up and he wants to be around children but he&#39;s a grown man acting like a female child oh hell no .
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I’ll tell my grandchildren this was Martha Stewart
"OK, now I get it 👌"
I&#39;m glad I only drink heavy alcohol. And now no more anhuser Busch beer. Or what ever the fuck it&#39;s called.
That commercial feels sticky!
"I just asked a feminist would you leave your kids in a room with him , be honest <br>Answer<br>No"
🤮🤮🤮
🤮🤢
🤮
How is that even a real person
🤢🤢
Its like a contest to create the worst advertisement for a beer.... that wins.
Almost unbelievable that such a meaningless and silly thing would go on to cause so much trouble.
Sick bast$## I wouldn&#39;t buy Bud Light if it was the last beer on earth... This whole world has gone mad😢
"They knew their age demographic, what were they thinking?"
"She, he I don’t care what you are but that’s Michael Jackson got that he he"
Thanks Mulvaney I have stopped drinking. I&#39;m getting in better physical shape
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVGDPlG42bU&amp;t=31"">0:31</a> gets me every time lol"
This this is why you dont hire woman to market on behalf of your company
i have not seen bud light in my town since this
Maybe i dont get it.. but the ad isnt that bad? Certainly not boycot worthy imo.
So in other words he barracks for every team spare me.
tengo una pregunta por su sonrisa parece que muy rígida  ?
That’s it. I thought he would use  a can and throw it at a dog based on how the reaction was
People actually got mad at this 😂😂😂
This is horrifying
I am really enjoying my switch to Coors Light.  Thanks Anheiser Busch.
And this vid destroyed an empire.
Wow look it&#39;s audrey hepburn!
World have turned into something very bizarre.
Mssp Dawgs what up. Super star garddoggy I see you..lemorp where you at?!?
"After reading the comments had no idea who this was but should have figured that by the name it was a dude.<br>I don&#39;t know, don&#39;t care about all that.  That&#39;s how chicks act and there are always going to be dudes who feel like it&#39;s not cool to front on the gender you&#39;re born with, perpetrating.  Feel like people masquerade and don&#39;t want to respect, trying to change a person that&#39;s unaware.  If you are getting physical with someone they have a right to know what you were when it comes to gender.<br><br>Don&#39;t have to like, but still don&#39;t hate.  Give me a some beer and leave me be when I ask, understand?  <br>I don&#39;t think the commotion was such a big deal but I do understand the response was what you can expect.  Now please get back to the game and chill."
Part of the distaste for this ad is it basically mocks the sports industry. Bud Light is successful because of sports fans and this person doesn’t care about sports at all. - go team? What sport is March Madness?  Know your audience.  99% are sports fans and this persons ignorance of sports being featured on a national campaign is going to torpedo the product
Ridiculous the outrage from this simple video lmao. People need to get a life. There are more important things to lose your shit over than this.
"I&#39;ve heard about this bud light saga, as a genuine outsider to this, is this the advertisement that killed bud light with their main target customers, or was it a whole campaign of advertising using Dylan Mulvaney that done it?<br>And this is the only thing I know Dyan for, so I have no real background to this person apart from them being trans."
"Ok Its bad but not as half bad as Gillette add , i think that one was mutch worse"
Lost billions of money!! Oh well that’s what they get!! Well deserved Bud Light !!!!!
Eef Hoos: Ik heb alles verkankerd.<br><br>Bud Light: Hou mijn bier en woke-waanzin vast...
"hard one to understand this move from Bud.... why would the brand do this?... I get that you might want to diversify your brand. I get that you want to move away from beer guzzling frat boys and redneck image at the BBQ. (no, not stating beer drinkers are always this.. just.. making a point.. relax)..  But.. you&#39;re then going to target the audience that is in the VAST minority in the world (but for some reason heavily catered to). <br>Not only are you targeting a negligible audience when it comes to possible sales,  but at the same time that new audience and the spokesperson that you decide to use aren&#39;t &quot;supported&quot; or accepted by a significant portion of your current consumers... how else did Bud expect this to go down?...  non-beer drinkers aren&#39;t all of a sudden going to start drinking beer..  but your current consumers will certainly stop drinking your brand when you change the &quot;image&quot; of that brand.. from ordering a bud light to have a beer, now ordering a bud light is a political woke statement that no-one wants to take part of when ordering a beer...  same as how the Ford Raptor now quickly became the car to &quot;represent&quot; trans.. simply because Ford put a rainbow on it...  Ford Raptor owners, clearly the most woke people out there....? why would you mess that image up."
"Just now seeing this. The thing that gets me is the can design. Its really poorly done. I think they were maybe trying to rattle peoples cage with this, at least part of their base demographic, only why would you do that? Its a really bad design."
Soon there will be no more bud light or any bud because of this insulting video. There should be a statement about who was responsible for this and the person they sponsored like Mulvaney could care less about saying about this meltdown.
"Why is everyone blaming him for the troubles the company ran into because of this commercial? He did the job he was hired to do. The company didn’t get taken down because of Dylan…They got taken down because of their own decisions to make this commercial, and not test it with a control group, and air it."
"- So we have a multi-billion dollar product and need an ad to consolidate our position in the market, any suggestions? <br>- Yup. I was thinking, we could employ one of the most controversial personalities in America, who knows nothing about sport, has a really awkward fake smile and ask them to record something on a mobile phone. It will be dirt cheap and save us a packet by not using an advertising agency.<br>- Excellent idea, get that done will you."
"Even if he was a genius, nobody could see that… nobody can see anything about his personality because he keeps making his sexual identity his whole identity. He’s cultivating that himself. That’s why nobody recognizes anything else about him, except for one single thing which is that he’s transgender. If that’s what he wants to be recognized for, that’s what he got. Stop complaining."
"It really isn’t that offensive. Sure, she’s not that likeable, but I can’t see anything offensive about it at all. Who gives a shit what other people do with themselves anyway? I’m less concerned about her, and more concerned about the amount of people who seem to be obsessively concerned about the sexuality of somebody else. I expect some backlash for this post, but I don’t drink the kind of beer bigots drink - and I drink with people who aren’t preoccupied with thinking transexuals all day 🤔"
First time I&#39;ve seen this ad. I&#39;ve been a copywriter in the ad industry for 18 years. One of my jobs is to come up with the ideas for ads. This was just so bad. Not just in the whole idea of using someone who is not right for the brand but in the execution.
"I really dont think they wanted to ruin the company, its their body, let them do whatever"
The devil is she
I fucking hate that little tap tap he does on the can before opening it. Really infuriates me.
"I&#39;ve just seen the ad for the first time. I&#39;m just as tired as the next guy of being force-fed so-called woke propaganda, but this is pretty mild compared to a lot of other ads. I never thought I&#39;d say this, but the reaction of a lot of right-wingers to this ad feels transphobic."
"love to see all those hurt americans cry about their beloved beer, keep it coming lmao 🍺"
"It would have been ok if he/she didn&#39;t thematized her transition and calling it womanhood. This person itself isn&#39;t so unlikable, but it should be about beer and sports and not about gender issues of a person."
"My goodness.  I can&#39;t believe this. I&#39;ve been hearing all this hooha for months now. And this was it? Bud light sends a can of beer with an impression of Fylan Mulvaney&#39;s face to her, and noone else,   she talks about it and everyone stops drinking Bud light? <br>You guys are ridiculous.<br>Enjoy your new favourite beer."
"...who green lit this?<br>&quot;Hi! Impressive carrying skills, right?&quot; <br>&quot;I heard about this thing called march madness...&quot;<br>&quot;...and I thought we were all just having a hectic month, but it turns out it has something to do with sports.&quot;<br>&quot;And I&#39;m not sure exactly which sport, but, either way it&#39;s a cause to celebrate.&quot;<br><br>......You can stop it right there, what the fuck are they doing? I don&#39;t think I could write a worse opening.  <br><br>Everything else aside, this is just...not good."
That can is legitimatley the most frightening thing ive seen 😅
This shoulb be a madatory video that has to be seen at AA mettings
"They did it for their ESG score. They don&#39;t care about profit anymore, and least of all the customers that corporations only see as $$$. What&#39;s coming down the pipeline is much more terrifying than this slap in the face."
"Im from germany, man I love how americans manage to come together and boycott these type of things.."
"I don’t mind trans people, but can y’all non sports fans stop pretending that you have no idea what’s going on. It’s not a personality trait to be confused on what the Super Bowl or think we’re all “going crazy in March”"
"Alyssa Heinerscheid: &quot;Okay, so my mandate was crystal clear: Alienate our loyal customers, blue collar workers and frat boys, by putting some drag queen on our can and drink our product in a commercial! Celebrate diversity and inclusivity!&quot;"
"I understand their motive:<br><br>They want to attract new customers, but they forgot to consider the risk of pissing off their old customers, it&#39;s happening everywhere because half ass marketing companies never changes."
Dude destroyed a beer franchise and both genders in one video..
It’s amazing how this was such a big deal. What does the average Bud Light drinker look like? Just make a commercial with a talking dog. That can’t lose. Why did they think this would work? When you do something like this everybody suspects you’re forcing an agenda and it fuels a bunch of bullshit.
People stopped drinking piss water cuz some person on the internet drank it.
"I like watching Amy Schumer because I dont have time to watch all the other comedians and hear their best jokes, so I come her knowing she will tell them for me!"
The title “comedy legends” with Amy was the best joke here!
Comedy legend? That’s a stretch
"Yes, Amy, you won!"
"She&#39;s hysterical, I love Amy Schumer!"
Shes not a &quot;legend&quot;.
I don’t know if there’s some other reason she has so many haters but honestly I watched this with an open mind and it was pretty funny
She&#39;s a legend in he own mind...nowhere else!
Legend in her own mind.
This is the best set she&#39;s ever done.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>And it sure is terrible.
"I&#39;m far from a comedy authority. But that was one of the funniest acts I&#39;ve seen. And, plus, Amy is a full blown babe!"
so pretty
"Is it me???!! Or is Amy delish???!!!? :P I know, I know... But still!!! :D xoxo Amy Muah!!!!"
Comedy Legend my ass….you can see open mic night comics better than her in any town.
"Sorry, but nothing she said was funny.<br><br>And I hate when comedians put their parents down.<br><br>I do not think that I would pay hard earned money to see her live."
Yall hating she doin it 😂
georl u should be washin dishes that would be funnier - at best you look like sauerkraut und wurst
Snuffleapagus. Solid. 🤣🤣
She is gross. Never been funny.
"Amy thank you!! You are really funny and you have quite a delivery and you are very pretty , stunning twinkle oin your eyes."
"Her Uncle Chuck is way, way funnier!"
This is a current video? I thought it was a vintage
&quot;Die Ganze Show&quot;<br><br>...Shouldn&#39;t that say &#39;Die Gaza&#39; as it&#39;s Amy Shumer? 🤷
"hmm, I didn&#39;t laughed once, am I to intellegent? This is so cringe ..."
"Wow Amy, lookin&#39;  F  I  N  E  ! ! !"
Why do all comedians give a punchline and then say um. It&#39;s strange
I tried....but Amy is as ineffective trying to be funny as Unca Chuck is at pretending to be a statesmen!!!!!  They both need to STOP!!!
“Comedy legend”? Seriously? lol
Haven&#39;t cracked a single simle. I tried. 😐😐😐 This was terrible.
Love you ❤️‍🔥🌹🎨☝️😎✌️🌄🥰
I love Amy👍🏻👍🏻
"Conflicted - Alot of shade thrown at Amy by other comedians for her stealing jokes.  I cannot believe that the majority of the material here is not her own, but I side with the comedians which is a shame because this is a great special and Amy looks amazing."
She is look&#39;n FINE!!  GREAAAAT-legz &amp; amazing-skin!  Her humor/routine is ...:  &#39;ok&#39;.
I haven&#39;t found a female comedian yet..... nope still haven&#39;t..
Them legs though 😮
"Since &#39;snowflake&#39; was originally a term for triggered liberals, perhaps triggered conservatives need their own label.  Like, slowflakes."
THIS WHOLE SET WAS HILARIOUS
Not worth the time...
Her cadence reminds me of Nikki Glaser!
seriously not funny.
I’m Mexican and I’m offended how you guys censured the joke about our race . I didn’t know Comedy Central Is leaning to the left
My brother is in sight looking at the outside the kitchen window and he&#39;s saying it&#39;s not going to freeze tonight so
She is the BEST ...LOL .. i Loved her. This was Time Tested!! .. Nailed IT!! ..Thank you Amy
The best thing Anthony ever put in her mouth was his jokes
"Lol, from the opening monologue about her highschool crush, she went for it! XD This special is hilarious."
Very funny lady
Comedy what?
This was her pinnacle.  This entire show is hilarious!!  Then the REAL Amy Schumer came out and......
disgusting
"I went into this thinking she was definitely not as bad as people said<br><br><br><br><br><br>,but <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=150"">2:30</a> minutes in and she is so unfunny"
"If you can see, the downvote total is 3 times up upvotes. That&#39;s extraordinarily rare for a major or semi-major entertainer.<br>She&#39;s earned huge hatred.  Let me tell you, she wasn&#39;t born with that; she <i>earned</i> it.<br>Sarah Silverman too.  What a tragic waste of talent, in each case becoming some of the most hated when they could have each been hugely beloved."
She&#39;s NEVER been funny 🤷‍♂️
She is one of the best female comedians around. Her joke are real and nateral....and she has great legs!😊
Greta Thunberg is funnier.
"I haven&#39;t seen this in years.......the similarities between her and Nikki Glazer are insane. Timing, cadence, etc."
I love not watching her.
This woman is a waste of time and space.
Yeah a legendary joke thief and unfunny person
"Yeah, that is 100% a paid audience. I sat and watched this video for 6 minutes and not a single funny thing was said. These people were rolling out of their seats.."
Is she considered to be a comedian?  Really?!
"Amy, material and delivery:  A+"
You are the best. Rock on Amy
This is so funny
She&#39;s not funny at all!
Legend ? Half her material is stolen!!
She&#39;s horrible.....
They laughed at her when she left Saturday night to be a comedian. Nobody&#39;s laughing at her now!
Genius👍❤️
Love You!
I&#39;m not in to Asia women like that
😂😂😂😂.... Im not. Laughing at her jokes i am laughing at her 😂...
Hilarious!
Great set Amy
Boopasleep
Amy is hilarious and I love her
Not funny.
The First time I saw her I thought she seemed cute. Then... She opened her mouth .... Been downhill ever since.
Hack...
"She wishes......OLD, PREDICTABLE, UNFUNNY."
Funny stuff!
TRAITOR!
Unbelievably sick. Not sure why anybidy is laughing. Goodbye.
"31, she was expired"
Go Amy 😂
I like Amy.. ❤  her thinking is so sarcastic and revealing &amp; truthful.. a born comedian 😂❤😇😇
Love Amy 🤣🤣🤣
Ambian and drinking aint no joke. I woukd go to jail if i told you my experience.
I so love her.❤
I love women who talk frankly about sexuality. It&#39;s so refreshing
Really... legend?? I tried.  She&#39;s just not funny
It’s weird how Americans are not used  to foreskins. In Australia it’s more weird to be circumcised.
"George Carlin, legend, Richard Pryor, legend. Amy??? Please. Would have gone nowhere without Uncle Chucky."
What are these bots💀
Just because she gained weight recently.. doesn&#39;t  make her less funny or attractive because her truth makes her funny 😂❤
And if a man started off with a &quot;joke&quot; like that...............
"When Amy is heckled, she doesn&#39;t waste any time putting them in there place by Calling &quot;Security!&quot; 😮"
I LoveYou Amy❤
"Opinions differ, but she killed on this - her delivery and confidence? All of it! We can dislike when she&#39;s off but also admit when she&#39;s fire!"
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should this “thing” be cloned. Never ever EVER no matter what. Already enough clunts in this world.
It wasn&#39;t us who voted about the bush. lol I am thinking it was because women didn&#39;t want us to know their real hair color. lol
"You all beat me to the punch.. so I need to change it up..<br>     If someone thinks Amy Schumer is a legend..<br>   They should immediately lose their job, because that business has a walking liability.."
AMAZING AMY
"As a kid, Amy wanted to be a comedian.<br>Everybody was laughing.<br>Now she became a comedian.<br>Nobody is laughing now."
Legendary  joke thief.
Is this her older stuff? I found it funny her new stuff is too forced
So funny saying the guy 54 years married wanting to ask his wife new tricks and yes I have had a women tell me it&#39;s hard to be a woman
Shes improved. I remember her act being that woeful id get second hand embarrassment
She is so beautiful too
AMY 🤟 SMiley 😁
I like her...
So fn funny 😊😅
She was a hottie back in them olden days.
"Gonna be honest, I only came here to see the dislikes and comments."
"THIS AMY, BRING THIS AMY BACK. THIS IS HILARIOUS"
Booooooooooo😂
Amy Schummer and &quot;comedy legend&quot; should never be used together
Wow.. how to get out of fee&#39;s for a blood test.. just donate it.. they have to give you a reason why you&#39;re rejected..😂
❤ LOVE HER ❤
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=1938"">32:18</a> This guy really wants to hit it"
Takes a special type of person.  And what bothers me is that there are enough of these special people on the planet to full the audience.😢
SHE IS NOT THAT DAM FUNNY..
That explains a lot as you need to know she was at a lot of freak off parties of Diddy 🤢🤮
If this is her best performance I would hate to see her worst<br>There&#39;s got to be somebody holding up Cue Cards for the audience or maybe the laughter is just a recording?
The only thing Schumer&#39;s legendary for is stealing jokes.
6 K likes - 14 K dislikes
"Surely, to be a comedy legend you first have to be funny? Schumer has never been funny."
She&#39;s great!
Is there a save button around here?
"Fantastic show, the negative comments make no sense."
"Whomever is responsible for the PR campaign for Amy Shumer should be banned from anything comedy. She is awful, but apparently deeply connected."
All those negative critics apparently not having watched the video are most definitely 🇺🇸 ! No country’s got more hypocrites !
This is a perfect example why I don&#39;t like comedians.<br>Awful.
Amy schumer. Comedy legend........nice joke
A Legend  in her own mind &gt; what&#39;s left of it !!!
Peak Amy Schumer
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=117"">1:57</a> No thanks"
Enjoyed this very much.
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Ah that&#39;s brilliant.
"Amy, I hope you are doing better.🥂"
How old is this?
Never seen white female comedy like that.<br>It&#39;s well considered
"Oh,the joke thief😮"
Again🎉😂
not funny
she made me laugh at 11 minutes with the mark twain joke by accident. im so angry with my self.
"So good! It made my day. Ya, am French!"
@amy you look more awesome and sexy as usual! did you lose weight?
I&#39;d knock the back outta that
"A comedy special so bad, that despite it being an English-Speaking American, Comedy Central had to put it on a German-language channel<br>Nichts für ungut, Deutschland, aber du verdienst es nicht, mit Amy Schumer zusammen zu sein."
And she&#39;s the class of the family.
I Love how half of her jokes are stolen from others
"ooh, nice huge MUSHROOMS there, Amzzzze"
Legend?  That&#39;s a laugh
Really tough to be a comedian when you have no sense of humor
Ozempic still doesn’t make her funny
"Everyone&#39;s laughing, I wondering what&#39;s funny."
Hilarious
wow im inlove
The most UNFUNNY person on the planet.... 🙄
She makes me wanna be a black dude with a nickname!
BRO EVERY JOKE SHE SAYS “UM” BUD THEYRE SO AWKWARD YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE SENTENCE GOING💀💀💀
About as funny as jockeys piles 🙄
Schumer is the most unfunny person ever
"It&#39;s funny that a lot of haters come on here to bash her, they obviously thought enough of her to type her name in! This set is gold!"
I came here only to dislike. Carry on...
❤ She&#39;s awesome
SHe got wittle chubby toddler cheeks
SHE IS AWESOME <br>😂😂😂😂😂😂
She&#39;s about as funny as Covid.
I love Amy Schumer’s comedy! Be well Amy!
Naughty girl 😂
This Woman is sooo Hilarious!!!😅
Can&#39;t watch this.....I can&#39;t  stand her!!
Thumbs up: 7.2K<br><br>Thumbs down: 25.9K<br><br>That says it all!
Looking good. I&#39;m not hitting on you.
Simply Brilliant!
She steals other comedians material
She&#39;s a legend in your mind.
the LEAST FUNNY PERSON IN AMERICA
Comedy gold!!!!!!❤😂😅😊
"Marry me Amy,😍🤩😘😍🤩😘😍🤩😘❤️💃💐💪🔥🔥🔥🔥"
A legend in her own mind.
Hilarious lady!  😂
Where are the jokes?
The people really find this funny
I reckon the Cabbie is the winner…!!
Never could find her funny
She&#39;s hilarious
Pathetic excuse for comedy
"Amy was looking so good in this video, and as usual, soooooooo funny."
Worst nasty comedian EVER
REAL talent does not need to rely on f-bombs.
Was any of this supposed to be funny?
Who”” even is this. Bruh please 😂👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Her timing is superb she’s the best
Your best set and when you looked awesome
The GOAT!😂

"“Legend”, huh?🤔🤔🤔<br><br>NAW.🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂"
Hilarious! Sooo funny
Smart and  intelligent!! The movie snatched with her and Goldie 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
"This is from 2012.  Danke for posting it, very funny indeed."
"Great show, thank you"
You remember when youtube still showed the amount of dislikes? Youtube real garbage for removing that. They knew what they were doing
Amy is so gorgeous and funny ❤
Not funny at all. Waste of time.
Her racial jokes were refreshing 😅 she funny. I liked her other jokes too. Great work 😂
Your awesome 🎉😂😂😂😂🎉
Es gibt lustige shows und es gibt amy schumer
"It is so bad, where is the comedy?"
"Bridget, thank you for being so brave😂😂😂😂😂"
Look it&#39;s miss piggy
This is back when she was awesome
Wow her jokes are not funny.
Awesome 👌🏾 ❤
"Wow, Hot Amy!"
Now that’s talent <br>Amy is a goddess!
"Ok, Chuck is your uncle"
"look what youve become Amy, you cant be proud of this, this was an epic performance of bad taste."
Carroll Stravenue
"whose jokes did she steal, again?"
She&#39;s not funny at all
Beautiful and hilarious. I love this woman❤
"So here&#39;s a new concept,  comedy without any comedy 😮 i never laughed as much since  i had teeth pulled without anesthesia 😊"
haven&#39;t seen this for years.  it&#39;s still very funny.
How is she even popular?
So this passes for &quot;comedy&quot; today...   I laughed more the last time I watched C-Span.
aleopecia! ha ha ha
So funny.
Not at all funny. I tried!
"Solid set, prime Schumer"
The only consistencies in this video for me was my undying frown and look of disgust for the entire 41 minutes.
Brilliant 😂
Boring and obnoxious
"I noticed that she follows her script to the letter, regardless of what&#39;s really happening. That make some of her lines awkward.<br>&quot;Only clap if you mean it.&quot; - No one clapped.<br>And it was not the only case where she &quot;interacted&quot; with the audience like that.<br>I don&#39;t know, feels a bit too affected to me... There are more natural comedians, who actually react to what happens instead of pretending.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=1792"">29:52</a>. That&#39;s another example. A few laughs, no complains whatsoever. <br>And she: &quot;That&#39;s the one? &#39;Boo&#39; right?&quot; Umm... no?"
What a legend
Having suffered through this I can safely say 100% she is neither a legend nor a comedian.
She had a hot body back then.
"this tapes like 10 years old or more, she looked smokin hot back then. And this set just absolutely kills it. so funny."
"I really love comic comedies &amp; <br>stand up comedian’s like Tracy <br>Morgan, Jay Pharaoh, LL Cool J, <br>Mike Epps,  Arsenal Hall, George <br>Lopez, Eddie Murphy, Chris Tucker <br>Chris Rock, Will Smith &amp; Jada Pinket,  Tammy  pascatellie,  <br>Wanda Sykes, Katt Williams, <br> Janet Jackson &amp; Rihanna..."
She’s a legend now?
I&#39;m richer than her
I like her.
Worst human ever
Friggin funny! Love you!!!
legend?  LOLOLOL
hilarious? Give me a break
she ist just awful
"I&#39;ve never seen her look better and unlike most standips, she made me laugh."
Don’t care abt subject matter or particular words but being unfunnys a dealbreaker
Comedy.....legend....HER?
"She and Niki Glasser are so alike, though Nikki seems funnier by a bit. Both are bad."
Uncut is my favorite so it’s a happy surprise 🎉❤
Was this filmed 20 years ago?
"I guess she has never been funny,"
su unfunny it hurts
She&#39;s hilarious AF 😂
With a great set
"I don’t know why people hate on her, she’s honestly the funniest female comedian out there. Her jokes are creative and foward, and her timing is on point"
I guess it&#39;s American humor. Five minutes into the video and nothing funny so far.
amy love ya chic...lol.
Don&#39;t like
Yo I am crying filthy tears!!!! This is hilarious seriously🤣
Kinda not funny
I used to like Amy then as time passed it seems like she got Mean/ Bitter.
Kinda not funny
Hilarious😂😂
Me scouring the internet trying to find who actually wrote these jokes before Amy 😂😂💀💀
Women just aren&#39;t funny 🙄
"She&#39;s thin,!!!!"
Don’t understand people’s nasty comments. Just stop watching if you don’t like it
Ugh...
This is hilarious I have not stopped laughing
❤ The 🌿 !!!
I’m not here to tell anyone what to think is funny….but if you like whitty raunch I just can’t understand how anyone would not think she’s hysterical. This was her best set imo. Too funny.
"I so try to love her and i still go back to Joan Rivers and Griffin. I am so sorry, I tried."
My doctor put me on laughing gas while watching this. I haven&#39;t laughed.
makes me puke
"Her best show, ever! Hilarious!"
just not funny
Amy Schumer is about as funny as Hana Gadsby..
Ive seen worse
She was so brave to do this material while she was 7 months pregnant
Worst comedy show I&#39;ve ever seen. Her brother&#39;s band tortured us for eons in time for us to stumble around the stage with a bottle to finish with a tirade about the 2nd Amendment.
Legend? Amy Schumer?!? 😅🤣😬😂
No thanks
"She is phenomenal and indeed a Legend. I can&#39;t understand the American hate towards this Lady. She is just too good, look at all her work. 🇵🇹💯"
I thought iam going use slink shot I bot with .e  but sory I dont crak I did I n the cawche
Amy Schumer is a fantastic example of a woman who is at peace with her own sexuality. Thanks for supporting women&#39;s rights Amy. We need to stop feeling ashamed of being sexual creatures. Men have had the right to be openly sexual for generations. It&#39;s time for us to enjoy the same freedoms.
creepy
Worst “comedian” button
She looks great but how recent or old is this video?
I find her absolutely repellent.
So thin
Cool!
not funny
Great finish ! 😂
Amy Schumer is a comedy legend???? On what planet????
Crude but cute. Very funny 😆
this looks like &gt;10yrs old. she doesn&#39;t look anything like this now
Absolutely hilarious show! Thank you Amy ❤
Ugh
"Meh~~ her jokes are awkward. Really nothing funny about it, 5 min into it and I already want to quick. If someone told me that she is pregnant “what you gonna do” isn’t funny, what would be funny is “you know who’s the father?”"
“Mostly sexual stuff” because that’s mostly what female comedians talk about. Talk about a stereotype…..Amy is it! Just like her dad in his own way.
Amy i love you 😂😂😂😂❤
On what planet is this a comedy?!
Luv luv luv this woman!! 😂😅😂
She&#39;s still got great legs. Beautiful even though her comedy is a bit off
She’s so cute !!
I like Amy... Cute &amp; funny... Sarcastic and truthful..and she turned that into funny..❤😇
Wär nicht nötig gewesen.
"Ok, so whos jokes were these originally"
Ammi Ammi you are gorgeous and beautiful and very very funny  I love you to bits. Sweetie pie 😂
"Comedy was decent, but those legs kept me GLUED!!! lol"
Talentless… so disappointed what passes for comedy these days
She is NO comic legend.
Upvote this to express your disliking.
Hey guys I made it threw the whole set and kept a straight face
Amy Schumer is NOT a comedy legend.<br>Lucille Ball is a COMEDY LEGEND.<br>Carol Burnett is a COMEDY LEGEND.<br>Amy Schumer is a comedienne and an actress.
You are awesome
Speziell aber ich mags
This is 10 years old?  Doesn&#39;t seem like it.
"Sorry Amy, 3 min in and not a single funny thing. I tried"
She is the female version of Brenden Schaub
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=1077"">17:57</a> - nope."
"The title of the video is the joke, Right?  ……. Right?"
she’s actually pretty funny i laughed
common Amy Schumer L💀🪑
Great show Amy
"So, this video has 6.7k likes and 22k dislike as for today 8th of november 2023. I wonder why 😀"
Nice show Amy.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=49"">0:49</a>, here"
"I watched this whole thing and the entire time, I felt bad... like I&#39;d slowed down in front of a bad car accident that left bumper to bumper congestion for miles behind me. You know when you pretend to be have been cautious, considerate passers by but they&#39;re really just waiting to see if the engine blows up before EMS arrive? I think EMS made it, but i haven&#39;t decided yet if the wreckage was salvaged 😂"
Original air date??
"Great delivery, great crowd. What more could you ask."
Imagine being a man and going to an Amy Schumer show. Low T.
She is GREAT!!!!!!
Always this girl was single that would marry her
should open with it. <br><br>didn&#39;t catch that till 3rd or 4th time I watched. <br>Ame&#39;s a badass.
She&#39;s stolen so many jokes. There&#39;s a video here on YouTube where a guy picks her apart. Not so legendary.
Wow - she is absolutely not funny at all !
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=906"">15:06</a> AMY AT THE VEIN"
Painful to watch.
Love her
She&#39;s so hilarious
She has the most beautiful eyes
Awesome ❤❤❤
Painful to watch like always
Perfect timing
I lasted 5 minutes.. didn&#39;t make me laugh at all .<br>I just heard her name and wanted to check it out <br>Oh well.
What a brilliant comedienne. 🇬🇧
Wait how are people laughing
She&#39;s very funny! People who don&#39;t think she&#39;s funny usually hate women and humor directed to an audience who is evolved enough to appreciate what contributions women have made to our society. If you don&#39;t like it- turn the channel or turn it off!
Is &quot;bathroom attendant&quot; some new term for bog troll?
Calling Amy Schumer a legend is like calling her uncle an American patriot
Who is this ?😮😮😮
I wonder how many of those jokes she stole.
If Mario Bath was a woman
I laughed a lot. Good show. She is good.
She commented on Derek ...made me giggle..now I  gotta humble her back.
Amy. The MASTER. <br>Thank you Queen! More more more MORE. ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥😂😂😂
Brilliant.
This is sooo not funny.....😞
Perfect legs to go with everything else.
This chick is so funny. Loved this.
😴
That couple gets in a fight on the way home over his brown coat 😂😂😂
She&#39;s about as funny as Trevor noah
What a sweetheart!
You look fantastic but free gaza
Love you Amy!
The longer I watched the more depressed I got
You crack me the fuck up Amy
I&#39;m Derrick lol
Amy Schumer is hilarious AF ❤😂
Comedy LEGEND....not hardly.
You are just beyond funny grrl...
A+ 🎉
She’s looking so good. 😊
Have you ever had a fgm girl friend.
First time hearing of and tuning in with Amy. I love certain comedy and must say I&#39;ll be tuning in more. Amy is too funny and among my top Favorite Comedians 🤣
ish
Amy Schumer + Comedy Legends – gutes Beispiel einer Text-Bild-Schere.
Ozempic Has done her well.
"I haven&#39;t found a real funny comedian in a long time, Amy genuinely Made me laugh a Lot. Loved it."
Texas or somewhere I’m not going
She’s just adorable 😍
❤
Didn&#39;t know she was that hilarious.😎
Booo
I feel like I&#39;ve just found my new favourite comedian
Give me my time back!
She is funny and a good entertainer
😐
"She was absolutely right about the chick whose parents were murdered in front of her. Back then, sometimes we didn’t even know where our parents went because they took them away and killed them without us even knowing about it."
Man.....so many talented female xomedians........but that schumer lady just isn&#39;t one of them. 🤷‍♂️
I liked her a lot! This was truly funny imo. What is with the totally incorrect like/dislike stats? As of this viewing it is 4.7K yay vs 12.0K nay? A 28.9% rating? That simply can&#39;t be right!
👎👎
A legend?  In what ignorance or eating too much?
😢
Why is she always copying someone?
I lost a bet
"Back when Amy was funny, and didn&#39;t think we all wanted to her her opinions on everything."
These bots are working overtime
"Amy Schumer during 2020 is when I noticed how naturally funny she sounds. And, she&#39;d likely believe when Others say &quot;they won&#39;t do it in your mouth&quot;, then of course, it happens accidentally. And the crowd loves it. Go down. Amy. <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/G8AfY6yWGuKuhL0PlbiA2AE""></a>"
hey Amy can we go out on a date?
AHHHH<br>Amy the GOAT when it comes to joke thieves.She has stolen jokes from the greats like Patrice Oneal and Kathleen Madigan.She mostly focuses on being a democrat booster these days.
So unfunny its legendary
Im curious for all the people that dont like her who do they find funny?
That was before she had a kid
thanks your looking great
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=1478"">24:38</a> is that rose leslie?"
How old is this show? She looks so young here.
not remotely funny
gahba
"I drive a 🚕 toooooook, 😉😘"
♥
Amy is my love! u r the funniest next-door girl i have ever met)
disgusting.  child sexual abuse is not funny.
She&#39;s been better 😊
She&#39;s a legend like Biden&#39;s a great president!!
For the people who cant see dislikes its right now at 12k
"Looks, if at all"
Love this
At least the comments are funny and original
Çool🎉
Puelca
"raaaaaaw, Amy, LOL"
"My favs <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=390"">6:30</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=423"">7:03</a>."
Sad songs
cute shoes
"I thought it was comedy legends,Amy Schumer doesn&#39;t  rate"
Gash
That was too funny😐
"She is GREAT!  Is stuff missing, IMDB has it at 61 minutes in  2012?"
"GREAT COMEDY, CUTE GIRL❤"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=66"">1:06</a><br>Freudian slip ?  🤔<br>She outed herself as a Hollywood kid diddler !"
Nice shoes
Is this supposed to be funny?
Super!!
😅😂😅
I thought you where moving.
What makes it a legend?
Im surprised hes still alive after being crushed by her
She crazy !
Now that was funny
Not funny😊
Free Palestine…
😂😂😂😂😂
Easiest try not to laugh challenge ever. 🥱
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=490"">8:10</a>"
Sleaze Legend
Don&#39;t shave
😂
"I hate her personality and she&#39;s never once made me laugh. There are loads of hilarious, brilliant, talented female comics and she&#39;s not even in the same universe."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=1084"">18:04</a>"
❤
This is great. Amy looks just like my High School Girlfriend. It isn&#39;t very hard to imagine what she&#39;s rockin&#39; under that miniskirt.
I love it! Finally someone is talking about s@x. In these times when people are mother Theresa.
"You&#39;re far from mediocre, Amy. Ya looking amazing"
American humour... English or Dutch comedies from the 50s are less lame and corny than this. I literally couldn&#39;t watch it.
amy shumer
"To answer the bush question, I myself don’t care abt looking around in some bushes, to find where I need to put my tongue, it’s nasty too, on the flip side of that coin, I don’t expect any women to do the same, so I keep my stuff clean shaved as well."
Outstanding 😂
Have you seen her face lately 😮
☺️
Great set by a beautiful girl
what a dissapointment! someone who insults her mom and kids publicly!
Comedy &quot;LEGENDS&quot;?
I mean look at her
She is funny 😁
Why would you think a uncircumcised man was weird? - surely if anything it is natural to have that skin rather than to have it removed for religeous or health reasons.
I don’t get why people think this is funny.
Go Amy!
Amy Schumer is about as funny as a car accident
In HER own mnd
When vulgarity pretends to be comedy...
cc cc   ccc ni the first time 😅😮😮😅😅😅😊❤
This is the best set she&#39;s ever done and it sure is terrible.
Put her on by mistake glad I only listen to 14 seconds.
Thank-you algorithm
Yall read the whole Bible when yall get a chance
The backs been knocked outta that years ago!😂😂
How is it even possible to be this annoying
"Amy the greatest... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=635"">10:35</a>"
"One of the lowest comedians.  Trite, poor humor."
Way to hustle girl .
This freak is no legend not even close
😂😅🤣
She has lost weight
Amy you are so awesome!!! Your legs are absolutely gorgeous as well as the rest of your body...😋
😂😂😂❤
"So sad, listening to her... you could  be forgiven if you thought women weren&#39;t funny."
Absolutely the worst comedian ever!
😂😅😂😂😂😂❤
Unfunniest comedian in the biz
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=577"">9:37</a>"
Didn&#39;t. . .laugh. . . once.
Hilarious
❤😂
👏🏼😂👏🏼😂👏🏼
Video is hilarious!!!!!
✨🙌🏻💝
"It&#39;s amazing comedy, except for some of the racism, when it starts to feel like: we all think this, and it&#39;s true and cool.... if it&#39;s like we are all like this, and it is terrible and savage, yes, I am having a great time..... I wonder how other folks experience it......<br>otherwise, brilliant irony and sarcasm...."
Uh she is not a legend.
🤣🤣
I Love The Bush !!!
Amy shows you don&#39;t need an ounce of talent to try and be a comedian
100% 😂
Her timing is out .
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=1625"">27:05</a> my guy just started rethinking his life decisions"
Wow the most UNfunny thing ive ever seen. Comedy Legends! Thats click bait.
Not a legend
She&#39;s looking cute lately
Steals jokes.
Kisses
"Wenn das Licht in der Disko angeht und da sind noch Frauen, heisst das bei uns: Restefick"
"No. Just no. That is completely, absolutely, curse words unacceptable. I change my socks too... 🤣🤣"
Then if you want to go to Disney world
Carbie back at it
Her comedy grates!
I kept this playing for more than 20 minutes. I&#39;m depressed.
Woke has been
Waste of life
I thought the comedy legends series was about funny comedians?
She took the funny out of funny 0.0 rate as a whatever she is..
National  Fixed League. !!!!!!
I tried to laugh.           It didn&#39;t happen.
"Maybe it&#39;s just my upbringing, but it&#39;s bad form to categorize men in regards to your stinky star and not let us see it so that we know which pigeonhole (yah...no?  it&#39;s funny) you&#39;re placing us (me)."
lame and boring
"Amy ,I&#39;m free tonight,what you doin&#39;?"
amazing  LOVE YOU AMY
"A legend? No, she is actually exists. She is an unfunny stand up &quot;comedian&quot;, which she has in fact managed to make work against herself. But legend? No; barely an  anecdote."
Just not funny. Always the same topics constantly used by female comedians.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=316"">5:16</a> Yeah, let&#39;s joke about aborting babies, not 🚫, I&#39;m out, ✌️"
This is old. .. Before she started stealing material from other comedians .
One of the funniest  comedian out there.👏👏😂😂
"Ok, so let’s get one thing clear…we used to have a single word: comedienne to express what the ‘politically correct’ numbskulls now use two words for: ‘female comedian’! Go figure…"
Well Mark Twain was his pen name so.....
“ Great “
"Welcome to the modern women, sad isn&#39;t it, but true...<br>It would be great to get back to having morals...<br>Yes, I know it&#39;s Comedy, but it&#39;s right on the money at least for California, and literal girls..."
Very old tape
Sick
Comedy legends with this dummy Gove me a break
"Ok everybody, calm down, calm down. #1 comedy legend?😂😂😂😂 No!!"
She’s so horrible.
Comedy legend is a massive stretch...she stole from Patrice O&#39;Neal
Who let baby face from happy death day make “comedy”
Horrible sorry not funny. Amy is to comedy what Albert Fish is to gymnastics.
Beautiful and funny....😍🤣😍
😮😊 am😊😊😊😊
Why are people laughing this is so bad this just proves that you neither have to be funny nor have a sense of humour
never heard of her and she is special.
she was kinda funny when she first appeared but NOW  i think she has lost  that edge i find her  bland
I was waiting for the jokes....
"If this woman ever came up with some original jokes, they were the ones that weren&#39;t funny."
Take a note from jimmy carr..... Actually be funny.
Funnest I have heard in years .
Love Amy!
why does the industry try and gaslight us into believing this hog is a comedic legend?
"Okay so, I’ve briefly flicked over comments and they were mostly negative. I’ll start my review by saying that I don’t, and never have particularly liked American humour (except Eddie Murphy). I stumbled across this video and started to watch and must admit, I found Amy to be the funniest American I’ve ever listened to! Found myself laughing out loud most of the way through. I’m now an Amy Schumer FAN! 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼"
A huge fan ...she is serving legs on this
Stop deleting the negative comments
Unfunny joke stealer!
Whooo❓️❓️❓️
Amy a comedylegend??? 😂😂😂😂😂
Sorry.... Not Funny
This is so bad 😂
better
She is very funny
You are just as funny as George Carlin.
Fun to look at but NOT funny!
"Even though I’ve heard these jokes by people who are better at telling them, this is still kinda ok"
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=1752"">29:12</a>   ROFL😂😂😂"
Amy Schumer is beautiful on stage 😍 ❤
So unfunny 🤮
Jewish
Legend - more like ran through...
Isn’t she supposed to be funny???
Most of her jokes are probably stolen from a bad meme compilation
Wasn’t funny at all.
So she used to be funny huh?  What happened?  She almost never makes me laugh anymore!   I really kind of dread her now.
😐
"Uhhh, she is terrible"
She is not only beautiful but hilarious also ❤❤❤❤ Love her
amy the zionist
RACIST women
This is so unfunny! 🙏
What a turn off?
"a real person and a comedian, the best. thank you"
Why are the audience laughing tho.
Die frau sollte nie wieder eine plattform geboten bekommen
Not funny at all
She was awesome until she went political! Then she bottomed out!
Pim
This isn’t bad. I chuckled. Just vulgar from a woman’s view. I get it.
I WISH WOMAN WOULD STOP SHAVING DOWN BELOW
Isn&#39;t she known for stealing jokes?
😂 i wish i was in front roll she is Beautiful two.
🥰
Lizzo really let herself go
i saw her first time in some roast... she is amazing
She isn’t funny. She’s just a joke.
Who is this Amy Schumer?
Amy is really funny!
Worst &quot;comedian&quot; ever!
She is the worst
Open Racist. How is she not cancelled
She is Carlos M... in a skirt.
Least unfunny person I’ve ever seen
double standards
and THAT&#39;S how you do it !!
😂😂😂😂😂
"The only female comedian  know is the  one from Sky News Austrailia, and she is just speaking facts."
Through this hole video the only time I smiled is when it was over
Wonder if this kinda humor would work if a guy said it.
She is a babe and too smart for me...wonderful
"Extremely Vulgar, yet claims to be Gods chosen."
Was some of this supposed to be funny?
worst actor of all time
But she isnt funny  the funniest part is i watched  the whole think and didn&#39;t laugh  i really really wanted to though
Hope she saved all the money she made cuz her 15 minutes come and gone.
"8.2k thumbs up, 26k thumbs down"
Nothing funny about her at all!!!!!!
"<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI""></a> MY EYES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Not funny
She needs serious help and hopefully she turns out to be hellen keller
It tuned out it was all one big lie.
Not funny
"Ungefähr so lustig, wie Gebärmutterhalskrebs. <br><br>Danke."
Worst comedian I’ve ever seen my ears are actually bleeding
I bet Amy could rock the world ❤
She destroyed Spanish in one single swoop
"Puerto Rican from the Bronx here, this cringy shit almost made my soul leap out of my body."
"For anyone curious, the Rules of the House of Representatives require that all remarks be recorded in English"
"She means &quot;I&#39;m Puerto Rican when I needs your votes, dummies&quot;."
She thinks she&#39;s in a movie.
She worked hard to memorize that one liner.
I can sniff the narcissism about a mile away.
As a Puerto Rican this makes me feel ashamed and embarrassed 😬 I feel like dying of cringe
I bet she says &quot;muchas gracias&quot; to the waiter at a Mexican restaurant
Even as a Mexican... I need a translation.  🤣
I think Spanish speakers need a translation😂😂
PUERTO RICAN FROM FLORIDA HERE. SHE MAKES ME WANT TO THROW UP!!!!
Even her “abuela” thought that was cringe.
she does not speak for all Puerto Ricans across the World.
She&#39;s no Boriqua. We pulled her puertorican card years ago. She what we now call a lost coconut 🥥 😏.

She can begin by helping her Grandmother in Puerto Rico.
She looks so proud of herself.  I wonder how many times she practiced that.
Fact is she does not represent Puerto Rico in  Congress. That role belongs to Jennifer Gonzalez elected by the people of the island.
I can’t stand her
As I a  Puerto Rican  I barely survived the cringe
Wow. Reading some of these comments. I never knew the Puerto Rican community had such a low esteem for AOC.
The Puerto Rican community does not clain her.
AOC is gorgeous in any color.
"As a Puertorican, NY can keep her."
“We can land on the sun. We’ll just go at night.” AOC.
I am Puerto Rican but I won&#39;t vote for her if she was the last person in this 🌎
"Anyone noticed how at the start of the shorts, the caption read AOC and then (R) New York?<br><br>For those of you who are clueless, R indicates Republican, D indicates Democrat."
Who keeps voting her in.  What an embarrassment to her constituents.
She also thinks she&#39;s black.
"As a former bartender, AOC DOES bring something to the table:  lots of boos."
That made my head hurt.
As a Latina I find she tries so hard to make people think she&#39;s a Latina.
I’m French and I’m still more Puerto Rican than AOC
She practiced all week to learn that phrase.
Being Puerto Rican this is cringey 🙄
"I am Puerto Rican, and I know many Puerto Ricans from NYC. Very few Puerto Ricans I know like or identify with AOC or what she represents. In many ways, she is far more part of the political establishment than she is an advocate for the people. I am not quite clear on what she has actually done for her constituents relative to her outsized political profile. Her REAL constituents appear to be the political party she fund raises for."
"Why do politicians find the job duties so hard to follow ? They are sent to REPRESENT their constituents,  NOT the world !"
She&#39;s so out of touch. I&#39;m a white and I can tell how cringe this is
She’s one of the worst representatives ever
"As an Indian , i support Puerto Ricans in their birth right to disown AOC. Cheers 🥂"
"Wow sooooooo embarrassing, she shouldn’t be allowed to say that… absolutely not a representative of Puerto Rican people!!!!!!"
As a Puerto Rican raised and born in Puerto Rico I feel embarrassed by this woman who doesn’t even what she is talking about. 😢
Vote her out! Vote her out! Vote her out! Make America Great🇺🇸
🙃🤡🌎<br>We have become the laughing stock of every nation because of the clowns.
"I’m also PUERTO RICAN, please begin by stating all your accomplishments"
“I was a barmaid and was born in the USA.  For some reason I feel I have the right to speak for all Puerto Ricans….” Sit down miss AOC.
She said something about sending more weapons to Israel to score some AIPAC points
"As a Hispanic she’s a shame.  They have totally thrown away the real meaning of the quote of the great MLK “I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” Go figure that out."
"Quality people are busy with real jobs and a real life. Politicians seem to be what’s leftover. Slackers,<br>Liars, thieves, with treasonable agendas. <br>Throw them all out. Start a new."
"Translation is, citizens of NY are paying my dumb ass $174,000 to be this incompetent."
What a disgrace to boricuas
"Well bless her heart, it only took 3 weeks to memorize those lines."
"&quot;I am Puerto Rican so that you know.&quot; Well, I&#39;m not Puerto Rican so that you know, AOC. Whatbwas the point of that declaration?"
"I was born in Cuba, left in 1962, grew up in Puerto Rico and I&#39;m a very proud American...I have to say, she is an embarrassment!  Besides I never heard of Yorktown Heights, the place where she grew up being in Puerto Rico..."
It’s extremely embarrassing someone like AOC can get elected to Congress. 🤦🏻
Half  those people cannot locate Puerto Rico in the map.
"It has nothing to do with being Puerto Rican, it has everything to do with integrity."
Translation: I have absolutely no clue what I&#39;m doing.
"That&#39;s (D) from New York, not (R). Media doesn&#39;t have standards anymore..."
Identity politics is her main tool.
We Puerto Ricans disagree with you. Sopla nuca
People actually voted for her? Wow
Why does she have an (R) next to her name that identifies her political party? Shouldn&#39;t it be a (D)?
They should have an IQ test before people get the vote
Trump 2024🇺🇸🇵🇷🇮🇱🇺🇸🇵🇷🇮🇱🇺🇸🇵🇷🇮🇱
I thought she&#39;s gonna say &quot;I wanna thank me for believing in me &quot; 😂😂
Never been so embarrassed to see someone say they’re Puerto Rican 😩😩
You would think a country so successful would know multiple languages on average but they’re strength comes from their military power not the educational system
"English is required to be spoken in all official US Government settings by US staff, representatives, military, etc. Exemptions include examples in official reports as appropriate, translators, etc."
She&#39;s the definition of fake
She doesn’t know what she said in English let alone Spanish.
Wow 100% hate commwnts for a hardworking representative who was fairly elected and has never hidden her background. Seems sus.
As a Boricua I am ashamed that she&#39;s representing us in Congress.
"As a puertorrican, I can tell you FOR SURE, that she doesn’t represent what we are."
Who are the people that are voting for her?!?!
"You dont speak for this boricua , 👎🏾"
This is a requirement under Congressional record-keeping rules. They will not transcribe foreign languages--the member of Congress has to provide a translation.
AOC is ridiculous.
She came back and said “yo quero Tacobell” while chewing gum and creating some distraction. AOC is a joke!!😂
How do you say stupid beotch in Spanish? 😂😂😂😂
So much arrogance from this one it&#39;s incredible
Hee Haw Hee Haw !
"&quot;Look here, I want the Latin vote.&quot;"
I think i&#39;ll move to Japan and make them change their language to English because I moved there.
She&#39;s a woke Democrat not a Republican!
My step dad is Puerto Rican and I’m more Puerto Rican than AOC.
What an embarrassment.
Translation: &quot;I hope you buy my bullshit because I don&#39;t have two brain cells to rub together.&quot;
"Her usual ridiculous behavior. The official language of all business conducted in the United States Congress, is English. Completely out of line."
"As a Latino immigrant to this blessed land , never felt or fell represented in any way shape or form by this BORICUA!"
They act like they&#39;re so amazed that she spoke in a different language.. these people are completely ignorant
Yes im the true identity PERCY LEE BROWN JR
Ridiculous  she needs to get voted out
How could anyone mislabel her political party?
I’m not a congressman but I feel like English should still be the primary language used when addressing Untied States Congress.
Just to clarify - she&#39;s a Democrat not a Republican
Embarrassing
She&#39;s definitely no Republican.
&quot;Don&#39;t call me gentle.  Gentle I&#39;m not.&quot;
She is a credit to Puerto Ricans and the texans that she helped after republiclans let freeze.
"There are plenty of other portoricans that don’t give a shit about what you are, pa que tú lo sepas."
This type of thing just creates a separation between us latinos and the rest of the American populous.
"As a Puerto Rican, I thought she was part Mexican this whole time."
She speaks ebonics in Spanish...it&#39;s &quot;street&quot; spanish
Jesus Christ how are we voting people like this into power. It is sickening
Is she Spanish or Latino? She is speaking Spanish like she is taking it in high school.
I’m white as can be and she sounded just like me when I try and speak Spanish.
I&#39;m ashamed to call myself a Puerto Rican with her as a representative
I am sick of her pandering and shaming America.
She is not a Republican.
Forgive my righteousnesses queens i love you 😊❤
I will never understand how people like this are elected to public office to serve the American People.  It’s disgusting.
For those of you who couldn’t understand she said “I’m in America but feel the need to speak a foreign language to feel like a cool person”
Boy she Loves to hear herself talk! She&#39;s so proud of herself!
I lose braincells Everytime I listen to her😜
She needs to translate the Spanish to actual spanish.
Baby hang in there your husband is on the way
"Could you imagine a elected official from another country going to there country’s senate or parliament or whatever and say “yo soy boriqua” , she would get laughed out of the building.<br><br>Only here you can exclaim your from some other country (regardless of territory status) while working for the people of another country 😮"
"She said. “I am Puerto Rican, and I’m a communist”"
For someone who has an Economics degree she really is ignorant of how an economy works. Someone should check into Boston University and what they&#39;re teaching.....
Welp folks ...... Any other questions about WTF is wrong with our Congress?  We did it to ourselves.
"Well, sixty-three million of us Americans understand what she said."
she said &quot;I put a piece of bread in the microwave and pushed potato on the buttons but it was still bred when it came out&quot;⚡
"Y los Latinos estamos asqueados de su conducta, usa su nacionalidad cuando le conviene. Le deveria dar vergüenza. Para que usted lo sepa!"
"Studies have shown, even 2 minutes of listening to AOC speak can cause irreparable brain damage."
Asking AOC to provide a translation isn&#39;t such a great thing. That woman thinks soy milk is Spanish for &quot;I am milk&quot;
We speak English as our priority language in this country so all words spoken in the chamber should be spoken in English for all to interpret and understand.
"I&#39;m ashamed. Being myself a Puerto Rican, she does NOT represent me. Whatsoever. Full stop."
I speak English and Spanish and I have no idea what the hell she said.
New York city please remove aoc from congress
She&#39;s a baddie so I&#39;ll let it slide. 👀
"Representatives from all different background should speak their mother tongue and take another vaccine booster, and open their houses for homeless people."
"PENDAHA,"
I love this woman so much !!!! She never stops fighting for all us she is so strong !!
I’m Puerto Rican and almost downed in my seat of embarrassment after what she just said 🙃
American politics should be for the American people not people of another nation.
"As a Spanish interpreter, the courteous thing to do is, say it again in English. Bad manners to alienate English speakers."
AOC the only waitress that brings nothing to the table..
"In 1960, John Kennedy himself received a financial aid offer from the Israeli lobby for his presidential campaign. He decoded Abraham Feinberg’s proposal for his journalist friend Charles Bartlett in the following terms: &quot;We know your campaign is in trouble. We’re willing to pay your bills if you’ll let us have control of your Middle East policy.&quot; Bartlett recalls Kennedy’s promise that &quot;if he ever did get to be President, he was going to do something about it [4].&quot; Between 1962 and 1963, he submitted seven campaign finance reform bills but all were defeated by the influential groups they sought to restrain."
Imagine if a republican spoke in Hebrew.
Hell yeah she has brought shame to PR’s!!!!!!!! To hear her say Yo Soy Boricua I cringed man! True story man!!! She’s a Minnie Mouse politician who can’t stay off of social media.
"AOC, can you say &quot;privilege&quot;?<br>If someone went up there and said something in French, or Latin, and then just smirked rather than translating, would the &quot;gentlelady&quot; expect them to translate?"
"I love you, AOC... The world can&#39;t wait to have you as the next US President!"
They even placed her in the wrong party
Ok? And?  What does being Puerto Rican have to do with her job?
Shouldn’t she be calling herself an American to unify the country instead of making divisions?
get rid of  AOC
CRINGE...UGHHHH
Why do we have to put everything in Spanish for immigrants? When I immigrated to the USA I didn’t speak ANY English and I had to learn quick because I didn’t have luxury of getting EVERYTHING provided to me in Russian nor did I expect it.
This woman is an embarrassment.
"On a Sunday she was a bartender, on the Monday she’s on the House floor. Wtf?"
You Speak English in that house !
Giving Latinos a bad name Desde 2019<br>Q triste
Taco taco burrito burito
She does nothing for her Voting Area.
She is such an embarrassment
What was the purpose for this?
"Yes Madam Speaker; Translation - I’m ten gallons of stupid in any language, and yield back my seat for more worth Senate Candidate."
Who ever did the caption at house must not know that AOC is a (D) Democrat not a (R) Republican
To get their vote.  One day minorities will see through this BS.
"As a Hispanic, who tf cares if you’re hispanic in government. It shouldn’t matter. What should matter are credentials and your benefit to the nation"
she. is. so. annoying.!!!!!!!!
Man reading these comments even you Puerto Ricans don’t want her ass😂😂😂🫡
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😵‍💫🥴🥴 Embarrassing human
Shes rude and looks down at Americans
She&#39;s not a &quot;republican&quot; she&#39;s a Democrat.
The native tongue of Congress is English.
Yes baby i am silly you ...
She confirms so many puerto rican stereotypes.  Que vergüenza!
Her translation was incorrect. I’ll do it for her.<br><br>Correct translation: “I am Puerto Rican and I’m an idiot”.
The lady behind is cracking up hysterically
Don&#39;t judge her Spanish just from these short sentences. Watch her interviews entirely in Spanish and you&#39;ll really see how poorly she speaks Spanish.
I like how it was nice and quiet when she left...
"Half breed here 👋, that doesn’t speak Spanish, I also cringed."
She wanted people to applaud her 👏
We get it. She&#39;s Trying to Piss off all the Republicans. And it works.
LOL someone give AOC a Spanish lesson 😅
Puerto Ricans across the world ?? and they say this ?? ... Congress said: &quot;you have to &#39;splain your jibberish.&quot;
Wow! As a Puerto Rican I feel embarrassed by AOC  grandstanding and pandering  closing statement. Smh!
I think our government acts like they are in a play on Broadway. Their theatrics are so friggin ridiculous!
The people that got her elected must be beyond proud.
Lord Help us. We have people like her leading this country. We are going to have to have a miracle😢
She reminds me of that one girl in class who raises her hand and waves it for every single question but always gives the wrong answer.
She thought she was so badass even though she said it entirely wrong in grammar and tone. And whats crazy is she is still gonna win re-election at any given time.
That&#39;s is just a taste of what is coming
She&#39;s frightening. Had nightmares of her yelling at me... then she started chasing me. She&#39;s angry
As a Puerto Rican woman who also very proud to be an American … I can hear our ancestors… screaming “Oy Vey “ …. You can keep her New York… you deserve her!!!!
I&#39;m so tired of politicians pandering to Latinos in the US by speaking Spanish.
Yeah we deal in Anglais Senorita.
As 99% of NYC puerto ricans what did she say? We dont speak Spanish 😂😂😂
"oh please, when is AOC going to just go away?"
"&quot;(R) New York&quot;<br>Hmm, I sense an error."
"No matter how many times they ask her to provide a translation, she keeps saying it in Spanish"
"My question is, what is she doing that her district keeps voting her into office?"
The biggest problem with elected officials is they are not qualified.  Imagine electing surgeons to their jobs or pilots.
Yo SI quiero Tus votos -- I translated that.      So you KNOW.      She practice that phrase.      Hey abuelita is still waiting for help to fix her roof
Alexandria Ocasio Cortez: Defender of the people!
Why does it say she’s republican?
I’d love to see her speak Spanish to Spanish speakers 😂
"Congress: Lady, translation please.<br>AOC went on Twitter: Please turn on cc (subtitle) ....for Spanish.....Espanol.....Lmao 🤣"
"As a proud Puerto Rican who loves this nation, she isn’t someone we associate with."
She’s a phony thru and thru
Puerto Ricans are Not stupid. They know she’s begging
She can&#39;t get English straight nor Spanish.
"We wait with baited breath for her utterances, and then she says this."
That chick has to go. She is a bartender and is nothing but a bartender still
Disgusting!  Not my vote!!!😂
She’s so simple minded! Amazing that people actually voted for her
She thinks she a rock star.
She&#39;s a mess
She’s insane
I would like AOC so much more if she didn’t bring up all the stupid identitatian bullshit all the time. It’s very divisive.
She Single handedly.. made me not want to invest in Porto Rico.. 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮and distroyed a beautiful language.. thank god for German 😂😂🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
"Good job New York, you elected this person twice."
I don’t know where in the hell she learned Spanish
More like the demon lady
"She only cares about other foreigners, NOT We the People, Nation as a Whole, or our Constitution!"
So proud of her speaking in a complete sentence. Give her a cookie.
Disgrace to America. Disgrace to humanity.
She acts like spanish is not being taught in grade schools.
That poor ignorant woman can not even speak Spanish correct in that short phrase she said. It&#39;s painful to pay taxes to pay her salary.
"So proud, been working on that speech since she was first elected"
go back
"another episode of word salad , makes no sense at all. we need to get her out of office !"
They certainly hired a bad actress in AOC.
That AOC woman is proof that there are Good Women &amp; There are those who Embarrass Good Women 🙄
A legend in her own mind.
how in Gods name is she still in congress?
Booooo 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
She’s truly has the Iq of a stop sign
No wonder puertorican can&#39;t gain their independence
&quot; THEY&#39;RE STILL DRINKING WATER OUT OF THE TOILETS ! &quot;    &quot; AT MY CONDO ! &quot;
"You know, she stayed up all night memorizing that line. And repeated all morning. 😂😂"
"If you love Puerto Rico so much, go live there."
Resign! 😤😤😤
Obnoxious
She might be the worst to ever hold a seat.
"It’s Spanish for, “I’m an absolute idiot.”"
What a clown.
She is NOT a Republican.
The bar is calling! Please heed the call.
That one single clap in the back killed me
She&#39;s NOT a Republican!!!
Oh no she didn’t 🙄🇵🇷✨
A.O.C single handedly the cringiest person in congress 😬
She’s fine
She’s appropriating Puerto Rican culture according to liberal standards?!  Cancel her!!!
AOC is not the Republican (R) of New York!
"I&#39;m glad she asked for a translation. This is America. We speak English here, little lady"
Who cares???
"I&#39;m certain she was worse at being a bartender, than she is in Congress. Everytime she speaks, I think of a train derailing."
Rep. doesn’t mean Republican it means Representative. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Let’s remember that there are people in this country that voted for her… let that sink in
"Jesus Christ, their facial expressions in the background they’re so damn fake. It’s sickening."
"I was instantly reminded of J.F.K.&#39;s sentiment of &quot;Ich bin Ein Berliner.&quot; While the intent was to profess a sense that he is one in common with the people of Berlin, it translates roughly to &quot;I&#39;m a jam-filled doughnut of German origin.&quot; He could have at least provided a translation so the real linguists could fix it.<br><br>We would all benefit if government officials would know the most common languages of U.S. territories, neighbors, allies, and adversaries, but there are many who speak and understand only English, and for some with much difficulty. Know your audience. <br><br>If you address the audience in one language, but want educate the audience about a common saying in another language, provide a translation."
The people of New York make great choices
"When the Spanish speakers are saying “What?!”, you know it’s bad."
Tax dollars well robbed
As a Democrat...what a goof.
She looks like she doesn&#39;t take any of this seriously.
"She never ceases to disappoint us with her lack of the knowledge regarding the Constitution, yet she is a member of congress"
She is not a Republican
Lunatic 😂😂
The lady behind her laughing 😂
Labeled her as republican......no no no we don&#39;t want her!!!
Such an embarrassment she is
The very thought that this female might have children sends chills up and down my spine.
"&quot;I&#39;m Boricua, just so you know.&quot;"
She is not a Rican she&#39;s a Ricant.
The difference between Trump and the rest<br>Eo-I&#39;m good for black/Hispanic....<br>Trump-for AMERICANS that&#39;s what I wanna hear!!!
She needs to be on a one-way plane ticket to Puerto Rico.
SHE&#39;S  A DEMORICAN!!!!😂😂😂
Just when we think she can’t get even more embarrassing…….she does!
You missed the best part of this clip: she was not able to provide a translation for the Spanish because she just learned that phrase before she went up to speak
The fact that the people of NY keeps putting AOC back in Congress makes me have no respect for New Yorkers. I hope every major company that has ever thought relocating to NY goes to any other state and may the next million illegals all go to NY.
Can&#39;t even memorize one proper sentence of Spanish
Lmao… she was practicing that shit😂
"She really though that this was necessary, and smart."
I’ve been to 26 countries and in every single one I tried to assimilate myself to their language and culture. It is very very rude to go to another country and expect your hosts to speak English and cater to you. I would definitely not speak English in a speech in a foreign countries legislature.
We don&#39;t claim her as PUERTO RICAN
This lady is so far from a supporter of her people and more for herself
I am Ecuadorian by birth grew up in N.Y.C I been here 51 years and I like her but she made Spanish and herself look bad.It&#39;s yo si soy Boricua para que tu lo sepas.She is Bronx born so basically she is not she is a New York Rican.
You know if an American went to the Spanish house of Congress and left on a note in English that would be a disrespectful person
So all she said was she’s puerto rican. Is this something on immigrations? Cuz Puerto Ricans are American citizens.
I’m sure all Puerto Ricans repel her 😂
"I still say we have found our Morticia for the next Addams Family movie<br><br>Edit: having given this further thought, I think Haley Stevens from Michigan should at least get an audition"
"Hey USA Today, AOC is not a Republican, the R after her name should be a D."
Send her away.
AOC is the Dylan Mulvaney of Congress
Why haven&#39;t they got rid of her yet
The Angel of Chaos (AOC) is spewing nonsense again
The great bartender ⛑🏴‍☠️🙄🤣😷😂🐎🐴😁🤪🤠😹
"Should be removed from congress, times are changing!"
Her coming from Westchester county does not groove with Puerto Ricans from the Bronx yet they keep voting for her. Smh
Well AOC can just go back to Puerto Rico
AOC this is America.  We speak English.
This woman can be president of the U.S. ¡Pa’ que tú lo sepa’!
W   T   F  was that
When does her term end?  If she is reelected the people of her district will prove their ignorance !
AOC POLISH THE HELL OUT OF A NOB!!!!
"Why so much hate?  I&#39;m very conservative, the true type. Not the highjack conservative of today so you&#39;ll know.<br><br>But this video made me proud of how this &quot;New Yor(k) Rican&quot; born in the Bronx spoke Spanish with that very, very beautiful Puerto Rican accent. Not like most Hispanics who are ashamed of their roots &amp; try to hide their accent. Very sad!"
“Gentle ladies” DO NOT speak in Spanish slang while speaking in Congress.
“Pa’ que tu lo sepa’”<br>That’s the literacy level she operates on.
She&#39;s proud to be a Puerto Rican American. I bet she will get backlash from the haters ⬇️
This is America. We speak English here. Not Mexican
"Other round of frozen Margarita, please."
What&#39;s the purpose in speaking English to conservatives? They don&#39;t want to hear the message anyway.....
Oh but that’s weird because there isn’t an official language in the USA
She’s ignorant and ruined my last name
Don’t destroy and use my BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE SPANISH!
"Translated, she said &quot;I am an idiot that got this position for the money.&quot;"
I’m Guatemalan n I’m more Puerto Rican than her
We do not claim this person at all. She doesn&#39;t represent Puerto Ricans
"I don’t speak Spanish, WTF did you just say ?"
She acts like she&#39;s burdened for being asked to translate meanwhile I have no idea what she said
"no she aint!!!  We Puerto Ricans have revoke her PR Card, we have cut all ties !!!"
She&#39;s actually Mexican 🌮🌯
She speaks spanish bit that was atrocious
"In a refrain that is said by USA , the ella es una droga."
Trump 2024
Most liberal republican.
"if she was from AIPAC, no one would have asked her!!"
Ppl are seeing thru your BS Mrs Ed
"Disfraces esto Pueto Rican ?? Disgrace to anyone that speak Spanish , except for the Spaniards under Sanchez"
Bet she had to ask her mom to provide her Spanish sentences.<br><br>She’s Puerto Rican ONLY when it’s convenient for Her.
100% certifiable.  Go make us a drink…..
I am PuertoR and i am not proud of her. Not a bit.
She should have gone back to Puerto Rico when she turned 18 if she loved her country and country folk 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Only English should be spoken on the floor of our U S. Congress and only the American flag displayed there !!
She’s such a caricature.
I forgive you my baby
"Owning a property in PR, I can tell you now from many conversations I have had with many PR&#39;s citizens, they do not want statehood.  &quot;We like what the United States gives us, but we don&#39;t want to pay taxes.&quot;  They do not want the responsibilities of Statehood."
Is she allowed to speak wrong in court during work? &quot;Pa que tu lo sepa&quot;  is wrong. Don&#39;t they have elementary schools in her country?
It appears as if the sign language interpreter needed help. I think that was the woman asking the speaker to have AOC repeat it
Why does the closed caption translate in Spanish but we are in America WTF transparency my ass across the board
She really thought she ate
"You are an American citizen, in an official institution of your country, so speak english! <br>And this is my point of vue despite not being American or having english as my first language."
The fact that she represents anyone
She always mad My god I think she only in her 30 but she look old she look like 55
No one cares enough to even translate it.
Basic high school Spanish <b>gasp</b>
Sooooo tired of politicians. Their self-importance is out of this world. Look at them all sitting there. Annoying af.
How. <br>How? Does she get votes...
She&#39;s neither gentle nor a lady.
Spoken poorly i might add.
Spanish is Americas second language so they can look it up republiclans
Puerto Ricans don&#39;t claim you! Trump 2024. God bless America 🇺🇸🇵🇷
Yeah give a DEI position to Congress for a land that isn&#39;t even a state. And hasn&#39;t had one bill that benefits ever American evenly passed. What was America thinking 🤔
This is so hard to watch that I cant stop watching it... do i have a problem?
The use of “ Pa” instead of “ Para” is vulgar in Puerto Rico where so many speak correct Spanish and not ghetto’s Spanglish. <br>For a graduate of Boston University and member of Congress one would expect more class and better reflection of her education. Suspect AOC may not even be aware of her faux pas and that is precisely the problem.
"She changed her accent just like Kamala, only when is necessary!!!"
"You&#39;re Puerto Rican?  So you know, big deal, bro!"
I love how she tried to speak so proper in english bus uses slang in spanish.  Identity crisis.
paque tu lo sepam ........... im an A merican with mexican roots ........ i understand that mexico spanish is diffrent from porto rico but i dont think she speaks spanish for real but she do got&#39;s some nice LEGG&#39;S
she&#39;s just like Jlo. Puerto Rican when its convenient
"What did she say, translated into English?<br>Love this young woman nicknamed AOC!"
this demon gotta go
"She said &quot;Yo Si,  Soy Boricua&quot; 😂 Thats &quot;I yes, I am Puerto Rican. The proper translation is &quot;Yo Soy, or Soy Boricua&quot;. She has terrible spanish"
The only time I’m embarrassed is when I remember she’s from my island 🤦🏽‍♀️
She can’t give a translation because those are the only words she studied for the speech.
"Bring it out in Mandarin, or Russian, or Martian.....She acts as if Puerto Ricans invented Spanish.....what a ......"
Still can&#39;t find a voter in her district who has voted for her. Been asking for years and walked the streets and bars several times. No takers. 😮
Comments are weird.
The most popular member of the New York Congressional delegation..
Was a bartender. Got put in a congresswoman’s job for about a 150K/yr a few years ago. Now worth 29 million. Yo si; nothing sus there.
She seems to be so proud of her colonial origins for someone who feigns anticolonial ideology
Bartender you really done it this time<br>Speaking in Spanish to have a good time....
Why cant our government use english?
"Well, I see  she is popular for a walk in the park"
Aoc will always be my PuertoRican daughter my princess 🤬
😂✝️🙏🇦🇺🇺🇸🇮🇱❤️TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TOMMY TOMMY TOMMY TOMMY PAULINE PAULINE HANSON PM 💯
She has a mouth full of teeth … 😳😳
And just so you know I am Puerto Rican boricua just to make sure that you know
that wasnt really spanish hahahhahahah so weird!!!
I’ve never heard her speak Spanish before this and I just realized she has literally no Puerto Rican accent when she speaks Spanish… interesting.
"When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) said, &quot;Yo sí soy boricua pa&#39; que tú lo sepas,&quot; she was expressing pride in her Puerto Rican heritage. The phrase translates to &quot;I am indeed Puerto Rican, just so you know.&quot; <br><br>### Context and Meaning:<br><br>1. **Cultural Identity**: By saying this, she emphasizes her identity as a Puerto Rican, asserting her connection to the island and its culture.<br><br>2. **Defiance and Pride**: The phrase can also reflect a sense of pride and defiance, especially in the face of any challenges or misconceptions about her identity.<br><br>3. **Engagement with Audience**: AOC often uses bilingual language to connect with her constituents and the broader Latino community, showcasing her roots and solidarity with Puerto Ricans.<br><br>Overall, the statement reinforces her identity and serves as a reminder of her cultural background and the significance of Puerto Rican heritage in her life and political work. 🤷‍♂️"
"😂 why do they need a translation? Man, I am nobody and speak 4 languages. Why are these “educated” politicians only speaking English? 🤡😂😂"
She needs to go back to waitressing. Her one liners might work in a bar!
She should provide a translation!
I apologize...&quot;I am AOC&quot; but I cannot spell AOC...
"I&#39;m also Puerto Rican, I&#39;m kinda happy that there is someone in Congress to represent us but we could definitely have someone better! At the same time I&#39;m still disappointed with the government as a whole. All Republicans and Democrats do is fight and argue to get votes. They never do what they say they are gonna do! (At least most of them). What about the open borders? Letting all those potential terrorists cross over. I live in Maryland, and already heard on the news about innocent American women being killed by gang members from Mexico, El Salvador, etc. I don&#39;t hate everyone from there, just the ones who commit crimes. They also need to watch the northern border to Canada too. Prices are still high. So many other issues that need to be fixed."
Spoken word is interpretation. Written word is translation.
Why can&#39;t Puerto Ricans talk proper Spanish? 😂😂😂 <br>&#39;Pa que tu lo sepa&#39; 😂😂😂
In the refrain ???
She’s so cute when she opens her mouth 😀
I am Puerto Rican. <br>She IS Puerto Rican. <br>She’s no MJT LOL. When she speaks- she says something. No scandals. Extremely intelligent. <br>And soooooooo freakin HOT. <br>Hate on Haters. We ❤️❤️❤️ our Haters😉😘.
As we ring out in the refrain that is said across the world?? Then says I am Puerto Rican so that you know? What?!!!!
Why don&#39;t you guys like AOC?? THAT&#39;S WILD!
Proud of her foreign languange..but unfortunately we don&#39;t understand.
Jesus Christ Almighty...
"&quot;Yo quiero Taco Bell!&quot; ...&quot;Thank you, that is all... I yield the remainder of my time...&quot;"
Cringe
I like AOC. I do not like this.
"P.Rican from midwest, we think she&#39;s evol. Worst P.R  politician in history.."
Y&#39;all are really mad over nothing. Really performative.
So many Ruski bots commenting on this video....
Aside from that sentence does she actually speak Spanish 🧐
Omg her spanish accent sounds really fake XD
"Translation or interpretation?<br>🤦‍♀️ Maybe if you studied another language, you’d improve your vocabulary."
Should be completely in English!!
First time I&#39;m hearing this phrase &quot;known around the world&quot;
&#39;LOOK ERRYBODY IM ETHNIC HURR DURR.&#39; Its so vapidly boring.<br><br>Your insidious identity politics is as childish as it is unimportant.
"I&#39;m from the DR, but stand with America. If the DR was better then I should fly back where I came from. I don&#39;t fly any other flag but 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸. End of story."
I&#39;m surprised she didn&#39;t say Yo quiero taco bell.
"&#39;Gentlelady&#39;??  Smdh It&#39;s Women and Men.  Or if you prefer formal, then it&#39;s ladies and gentlemen.  Don&#39;t tell me, she spells women as &#39;womyn&#39; too???"
I&#39;m Puerto Rican and this was Cringe! We don&#39;t claim her!  TRUMP 2024🎉
Imagine doing this in a Spanish-speaking country’s court.
Just because she said a few words in Spanish doesn’t justify anything. Actions matter more.
why youtube algorithm sent me here just to give me goosebumps 😢
AOC: &quot;I represent Puerto Rico even though I have never lived there myself&quot;
"Politicians try so hard to be like us. They&#39;re just like Drake, Not like us"
Free Borikén from U.S. occupation! 🇵🇷🐸
Send child voice silver spoon bye.
"Lady, I&#39;m sorry but this is the United States of America Congress"
Taylor Sharon Lewis Mary Martinez Dorothy
What the heck kinda Spanish is that?!! Is that how Puerto Ricans speak?! What is &#39;Sepa&#39;?!
You can&#39;t provide a translation when you don&#39;t know what you just said
"That&#39;s right, Cortez not everybody is Puerto Rican in New York or in this country"
Voting for Ocasio-Cortez is like voting for Maduro&#39;s wife here in Venezuela. 😒🤮
Wait do puerto ricans not like AOC because she hasn&#39;t brought puerto rico statehood yet or...?
"Wow,she&#39;s aging just like an old Spanish granny"
"AOC is awesome. HAVE SOME PRIDE, PRs. Cheer our people. <br>You think rePUBICans are helping us? Think again"
Our primary language is English thanks though…
This is America!!! Speak English! (As i play in south American servers online)
my favorite big booty latina!!!!!  the most cringe worthy woman on earth. love you Aoc 😂
But guys remember...black lies do matter.
She&#39;s so deep into politics now that even her constituents don&#39;t understand simple Spanish that leaves her mouth...
"When labeled communities thirst for self-empowering messages from personalities like James Baldwin, Malcom Shabazz, Marcus Garvey, WEB Dubois, F. L. Hamer, etc., they are left with Ms. Cortez.<br><br>Caribbean Hispanics need to eschew Ms. Cortez’s message of dependency cloaked as benevolence.  Meanwhile, STEM graduates from Asia are setting the standard for academic excellence. <br><br>We only have ourselves to blame, as we sing, dance, and shake ourselves into cultural obsolescence."
Puerto Rican also raised in NYCHA. To be a member of congress you must be an American regardless of heritage. Immigration Integration into Nationalism.
One of many languages spoken in he <br>US. Repressive Anglos fell challenged!
Would definitely give AOC the z sumpin’ just not my vote
This is as bad as Kennedy calling himself a Jelly Donut while in Germany.
&quot;Yo Si from affluent Westchester.&quot; 🙄
The first Amendment includes right to language choice which is why we don’t have a national language.
&quot;Gentlelady&quot;?? 😂😂😂 This worldd....
"Who does she think she is? Speaking terribly spoken Spanish? Sounds more like some dialect, rather than Spanish…"
I don&#39;t like her carrer politian
PLAYING BOTH ENDS AGAINST THE MIDDLE. A SINCERELY SNEAKY -SNAKEY  SO-N-SO.
"😂😅😂😅😅😅😅 she translated it to , Yo Karo syrup Taco Bell"
We need her translation skills here in Chicago because we&#39;re expecting up to 25.000 more during DNC. Don&#39;t blame Abbot. Blame Mayor Johnson and Governor prickster.
"Im from Germany, but shouldn&#39;t you speak ENGLISH in governmental bodys!?? Or at least translate right away."
How did she get voted in? Seriously Puerto Ricans or wherever she’s from sage yourself from this woman!
As a public servant she should be speaking ENGLISH when she is performing the duties of her office.  I say this as the grandma of a Puerto Rican granddaughter.
All lives matter what??
What she said in translation is make America great again vote for President Trump
She is so irritating. Her body language the way she talks her voice everything is irritating
"She just tell Spanish Speakers in Spanish, &quot;now is the time to invade America&quot;?"
Why this woman keep living of our taxes ?
"Prisoners &amp; terrorists were not released by Dr. Yunus government in Bangladesh🇧🇩, on August 5 after Sheikh Hasina&#39;s escape, the corrupt police released the prisoners &amp; terrorists by helping India🇦🇷"
"She didn’t say it Correctly, even tho it seems rehearsed"
"Her arrogance and racist tendencies were showing, that statement meant more to her than following decorum. Why they let her off 110th and Roosevelt I&#39;ll never know..."
Yo si is not ( I am) Yo soy is I am .. she&#39;s just using a Puerto Rican expression to act as she&#39;s more boricua than me ..born and raised in Puerto Rico... She&#39;s American just like my kids..
I don&#39;t like her and unless she&#39;s standing in Puerto Rico she needs to be speaking English🤦🏻‍♀️
As she should but I’m still voting for Kamala
We really need to make English our national language…
I am Puerto Rican and I don’t like her or will  support her in anyway !!
"So, she’s a representative in the USA, but claims to be Puerto Rican? Huh?"
She just shamed PR. She’s awful in every way shape or form
"As cringe as it is, she has a point... your country does NOT have an official language."
She knew nothing of PR political mess regarding statehood....got into it and needless to say came out with a black eye.
What Ashame you are living out of USA salary I know. That Puerto Rico became part of The USA but the way you talk is an ungrateful way of referring to the land you are stepping on
"The translation left out the most important part, Soy Boricua means &quot;I AM&quot; That&#39;s what &quot;soy&quot; means, but they truncated that part which was the essence of her statement.  What does, &quot;Puerto Rican, just so you know.&quot; mean?  She said, &quot;I am Puerto Rican...&quot;"
It’s an English country. Atleast as if today
People here are so weird she is the American Dream. Stop being weird. 🇲🇽
Tell her the Puerto Rico in unrecognized now and becUse of people like her the Tainos are gone
Tell her the Puerto Rico in unrecognized now and becUse of people like her the Tainos are gone
she doesnt sound puerto rican when she speaks spanish
Nothing personal but you should be representing the citizens of the United States. Glad you are proud of your heritage but there is time and place for that.
She’s saying she’s an Indian from the Boricua tribe. This is of course when a Puerto Rican was a glint in a Spaniards eye.
"What? You&#39;re from Rich Port, Oh Puerto Rico You mean, it doesn&#39;t sound as fancy &amp; cultural in English does is..."
"Soooo fake, we don&#39;t claim her....she would not last a day in Puerto Rico😅"
I hate to credit AOC but to be fair we should be teaching Spanish in elementary school. We should be more friendly with our neighbors. (That doesn’t mean we should leave the door open tho😂)
What she meant was what has been by the burden has been and has be as the burden
Just remember puerto ricans are Americans and I&#39;m proud of that. Because my parents are from Puerto Rico I am from New York so we are American citizens and them Proud
First of all as a bronx native AOC is from Yorktown Heights that&#39;s like repping Compton when you&#39;re from Beverly Hills secondly I have not met a Puerto Rican person in New York that likes AOC
You see the hatred and anger she speaks with as well as the girl smiling behind her. <br>They’re just hoping that soon we will all be speaking Spanish and English will no longer be our language. This is all HATE!! There is nothing kind or loving here.<br><br>USA AND ENGLISH!!!❤❤❤<br>TRUMP 2024🎉🎉🎉
Not American first huh? <br>😂<br>Great passage of time for America
Shes not Puerto Rican. <br>She is a Usas citizen. <br>You dont have the right to say this living in the USA. <br>Puerto Rico es España. Y siempre lo sera.
"Alright. Time to brush up on my Irish &amp; Scottish. “Yo! I see yer fookin’ panderin’, lassie, an’ it don’t impress me much, mauverneen.”"
Comments are a red flag. Maybe stop invalidating her identity and go touch some grass
She should be removed from Congress for that alone.
Puerto Ricans have Olga and Chayanne and Daddy Yankee and so many othes even Bad Bunny none of them would endorse her
",Boricua are the native people not of Spaniards if i am not mistaken"
"I know real Puerto Ricans, great people that I work with and have the honor to call friends. AOC is no Puerto Rican."
I thought i was in a different dimension before realizing the R didnt meant republican
Make English the absolute language in the US. What she just said was a finger to the uSA
I like all the white white people claiming to be Puerto Rican in the comments lmao.
Crazy I thought we were in America. Do you think she would be representing the people in her district that speak English but we know who she’s really after
Certainly if you speak in diverse tongues you should have an interpreter present to translate. ;)
well since we got all these claims that people could do whatever say whatever and ever any language in the American Senate and House of Representatives maybe some of these people should start speaking in German
Love her or hate her the House Rules of Procedure and the House Rules of Decorum require the Speaker to ask that.  While you may think her comments were cringe or not they have to ask that when foreign languages are spoken.
"What do you call the squad in quicksand ??  Answer :  cuatro sinko , of course ."
"She needs to go back to tending bar. She was probably a wonderful bartender, but i don’t think she is a good politician. Especially not for true Americans. Puerto Rico isn’t even a state and doesn’t want to be until they need our money or any type of aid.. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"
Puerto Rican here! We don’t claim her. Please let the Italians take her!
"She brings more to the table than Boebert, MTG and Gosar combined"
"Im done...that phrase makes no sense translated. This is why learning another language is harder, because the actual native speakers hardly speak them proper anymore. <br>Im just saying, not sure where the &quot;si&quot; comes from...&quot;yo si soy...&quot; that seems like the si was an additive...without si, it then becomes what she was actually saying &quot;i am...&quot; as of now it looks like &quot;i yes am<br>.&quot;<br>But languages like to play games and will say thats slang"
"I live in Bentonville Arkansas, headquarters of Walmart, and we have people from literally every continent except Antarctica bc Walmart likes to move people around the world a lot for their jobs and nobody has ever said anything like that. I know a few people from there and none of them have ever said anything close to that. They act like Americans and are some of the chillers guys to hang with until you meet someone who thinks like this woman.😂we once had a guy who was Egyptian/nigerian/ British and would give us just as much shit as we gave him (joking around obviously) but singling out one group and saying they all think like you is ignorance"
Puerto Rico is a territory of the US… when on the floor speak English.
That Cortez person is a mini Kamala Harris!!😂😂
The Russian Trolls are at work here making empty comments. I am at least AOC helps bring some sanity to the sick state of American politics.
This is what happens when you let people from other countries in your government.
"I&#39;m hispanic and I would never ever speak spanish in this situation even though she worked hard to remember the pronunciation, I don&#39;t even use it at work with others, I only use it outside of work with friends and family."
This is America what doesn’t she understand
She said that perfectly fine and people hating like shut upppp
This woman is a disservice to the Latin community.
She is beautiful 😍 but she seem like bad attitude 😒 trump could like her but i get her feelings I am same way ..😊❤❤ but babe letting it know 😊
"She was born in new York, she&#39;s not Puerto ricaña, my parents were born in mexico that doesn&#39;t make me mexican because I never lived or ever been a civilian in mexico, I was born in america and I&#39;m indigenous american"
As a illegal immigrant from Mexico .. we can not stand her and do not support her. She is crooked
Why does my girl embarrass herself w shit like this 😂😂
I thought she was elected to represent Americans in the Bronx.
"You Know they are So many chances <br>And people take Them,"
Love your discussion videos way more than even the discussion based channels out there like Magic Historian and Pleasant Kenobi and especially Desolator Magic🙄. Keep it up because you have very reasonable takes that are refreshing and not rooted in engagement baiting
I didn’t hear a boricua accent there AOC. And I’m sure you rehearsed that line a billion times
"Does this woman not realize that Puerto Rico is part of the United States?  Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. They are considered US citizens.  They can travel freely, and move anywhere they want in the United States. Once they have residency within one the 50 states, they are granted every single right as an American, such as the right to vote for President.  A person from Puerto Rico can enter the United States (50 states) anytime they want, and they can move here anytime they want.  There are about a half a million Puerto Ricans in the American military that fight for our country every day."
"I&#39;m proud of you AOC, YOU GO GIRL!!!!!"
Jqlajsalais she learn that sentence before go to bed lol
"Official language is English in UK and US, those who need translation can hire a translator.  Such translation should be provided in All Languages or none.  It&#39;s discriminating against non-Spanish immigrants.  It&#39;s offensive to non Spanish Americans who&#39;s second language is non Spanish (least popular language around the world since Spanish empire no longer exists 😂)"
She sucks....seals it by this statement to only help her
If you want to see how did ened her &quot;vision&quot; of &quot;socialism&quot; all you need to do is look through history and read about collapse of the soviet union and venezuela😢
how does this help America...crazies
You not Boricuas born and raised in the island you cannot say you have experience what’s a Boricua living at all you to spoil
God couldn&#39;t figure out anything else to do with this skin?
"First time I ever heard the word &quot;gentle-lady&quot; in my entire life. What kind of world we living in? For the record, AOC ain&#39;t worthy of that title anyway"
😂The women behind her 👵you did great Joe
"My wife is Salvadorian, I’m Aryan as heck yet I am more Latino than AOC"
"Pretty standard procedure, the scribe on the House floor has to record what was said."
Damnn that was so cringy and im boricua in pr. Scripted for tiktok
"She is aware that their land is but a Colony of the United States , right ? Mija you need to first check yourself at the door and maybe help your island have autonomy.  Also noticed voice getting all nervous toward the end.  Solo por voto ase su show esta vieja"
Wait what?! 😂😂Biden said his uncle was eaten by cannibals?? Im stoned and this video is taking me outtt
"I am so sorry for New Yorkers. I know they can handle themselves, but my heart still goes out to the citizens ❤😢"
Sorry! Is she for the US or Puerto Rico and the rest of the world 😮 should she be representing you in Congress?👀
Jesus I’m Hispanic and my Spanish isn’t that best bad damn way better than that. It’s “yo soy” 😂
"I despise this “human being.”<br>I wanted to use the “C” word, but I’m trying to be a better person"
Ask her to elaborate on that in Spanish. I’d love to just see how far she gets.
This is America AOC! We speak English here.
I like her confidence and i used to watch her videos
She just flaunts her ignorance
she sounds like a teachers pet showing off her one line of espanol
I don&#39;t speak Spanish; what was the translation?
Get out of the U.S.A. and take the rest of your &quot;squad&quot; with you 😡
WE LOVE YOU AOC! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!  YOU ROCK!
Don’t forget… her granny lives in a shack
Can you put links to the videos your channel depends on?
I identify as a based Puerto Rican in the comments section and I just died of cringe pa que lo sepas.
It’s hard to read the comments. You see the red people and they stick together thro thick n thin. I would never run for government. It’s a lonely road that non in the comments can relate lol.
"Well, by start packing go back to Puerto Rico."
She continues to segregate the population!
They want to rule a nation but cannot understand the most basic of dialogue.
Bronx dump her.<br><br>Two of the Squad are gone
Why her family move to América?
I love AOC but why does it say (R) New York!! she is not a Republican
Damn i thought she was American ???
Cringe
I doubt any PRs claim her
You can get your Puerto Ricon rear back to the island
"So, what&#39;s the big deal on being a Burricua ❔🤔"
Aoc walk the streets of ur community  I dare u
The fact that people on the left don’t see the virtue signaling is insane to me. You are truly lost if you cannot tell that these people are lying to you.
Arriba Alexandria
Can&#39;t wait till she can run for president.
"“Yes, I am a Puerto Rican, so that you know! “  she sounds like an entitled brat… um… no one cares 😂"
Im starting to think she cant speak Spanish. She has messed up before which is why i gather its been so long since she made another attempt.
I don’t think AOC is bad but damn that was corny. 😭😭💀
I believe Biden is Puerto Rican also. He said he was.
I love AOC! Keep up the great work Lovely! 💕
She doesn&#39;t speak even speak Spanish
I&#39;ve seen many Jr. High girls with more sense than her.
Your speaking to the boards Harris you see
What was the reason to make a useless statement other than letting everyone know how she is street material.
"I don’t like her, she is so arrogant , rude and no smart enough to work to the government"
She definitely doesn&#39;t represent me
She definitely doesn&#39;t represent me
She is so very beautiful ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Babe will heart break me if I was a date no offense but much respect to her rights
I’m half Puerto Rican and we want nothing to do with her
Cringe
Send her to Gaza for some charity work.
She should leave the dark side and come on over to the light.
"All the hate and venom directed at her is just sad. <br><br>But the incels need someone to yell at, I guess."
I want Puerto Rico to become an independent nation.
don&#39;t put down my Country like this
aoc single-handedly put an end to blonde jokes.
She shoulf have replied &quot;google it&quot;
Uhm ..Cringe button 🫣<br>👇🏻

Translation <br>&quot;Im a liar in two languages&quot;
"I don&#39;t speak Spanish, and I know she messes it up."

She should’ve said “ Si soy una imbecile”!
In what regard is refrain had from the statement she made?
Criiiiiiiiiiiiiiinge!😂
I&#39;m not following this context at all 🤔
Asking for a translation?   Micro or Macro aggression.
She was hoping for cheers but got that one clap in the back .. lol fkn lame
The real name is Sandy Cortez.
Talk about word salad bullshit
Puerto Rican American 🇺🇸
As a Puerto Rican that was so cringe to watch
Democrats pride and joy
AOC should not be allowed  to speak
😮 translation ..I need your votes?
She never refers to people as Americans.
What is the Translation tho? Curious
So what if they asked for a translation.
Haven’t cringed this hard in a while
We do not care
"She does not speaks spanish... I don&#39;t even know how many times she had to repeat that short sentence, still came out like a gringa 😆<br>The Boricua more Latina I&#39;ve ever seen, if PR was located in South America😂😭😭"
No you&#39;re not. Badly pronounced

Even Asians can say that simple line
"Wow! I&#39;m impressed! I didn&#39;t realize that she could speak Spanish! But, since she is Latina, I would be more impressed if she could speak the language of the ancient Romans + the Roman Catholic Church which is Latin. If 1 notices, there are at least half of USA state seals that have a Latin motto. Also our money has the Latin inscription, E Pluribus Unum."
What on earth was that supposed to mean?😳
Bro been on duolingo too much
That lady looks crazy...
Too funny ! She’s too smart for them 😂
That sounded Italian 😂
"With Trump as president, moral values of America will increase. We need him back to the White House to sweep away Biden’s and Kamala’s trash and MAGA! ❤🇺🇸♥️🎉🎊"

I ask my Spanish friend and she said the translation is. <br>I am an incredible Dumb ass.
"No sabe ni hablar español y tira del idioma para rascar votos.. lo peor es que este tipo de tretas políticas funcionan, la gente es demasiado inocente."
Si ajá claro...si es así porque no quieres que puerto rico sea parte de EEUU?... porque votarían a la derecha liberal clasica
"Si, si, manos. Claramente todo de la gente  boricua la odian. Si los commentos se reflejan de verdad. Talvez nadie puede explicarme poque, como lo que pasó? Lo que ella hice mal?"
Puerto Ricans don&#39;t claim her . She should have said : 😅Yo si soy estupida pa que tu lo sepas
esa tipa aprenda hablar primero pa que tu lo sepa ??  para que tu lo sepas esto es castellano  oh espanol  se me hace esta gentevsin educacion es politica????
"Heres how you would actuall say that<br>Soy puertorriqueño, para que lo sepas"
esta Boracha  no representa  a los latinos primero que se educa  me irrita su espanol! y su actitud   solo es una oportunista  ya viste mejor
"Yo si soy boricá pa q tú lo sepas, dónde está el problema?"
"I think she means &quot;yo si soy pendeja, va que tu lo sepas&quot;"

"She said , I suck at my job and now I&#39;m going to have to go back to bartending."
"I love her so much! Go, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez!"
She only speaks very basic Spanish…She is not as fluent as most people think. She can’t hold an entire speech in Spanish. I’ve seen her try and it’s kind of embarrassing
No wonder she&#39;s annoying.  😂

An elected official proud to claim she is Puerto Rican wow. Why is she representing the American people?
😂
Hell nah! No quiero a una socialista representandome. I don&#39;t want a socialist representing me.
Hay why don’t you move to Puerto Rico and be the president of Puerto Rico and make Puerto Rico independent and you can run it the way you want it that would be a great thing for you<br>And for us in the USA😊

and you wonder why the dad wont let you see your kids
&quot;You&#39;ve dealt with me a million times&quot; - tells me the cops are sick of her.  She needs jail time and a mental health evaluation
Dad should get full custody. She doesn&#39;t have any coping skills.
I cannot express how thankful I am for bodycams and these videos 😂❤
She definitely ain&#39;t getting her son now
She doesn’t deserve custody of her children they aren’t safe with her. She’s unhinged.
It&#39;s depressing to think how many kids have parents like this
This behavior will be used against her in a child custody case.
&quot;Because you act like that!&quot; Welcome to the consequences of your own actions.
I am not married to this gal and I still want a divorce from her.
This is NOT how to gain custody of your child back.  This is exactly how you LOSE it.
"&quot;quit trying to turn this on me!&quot; <br>Ma&#39;am, you made this entire situation about YOU."
"Whoever decided this woman shouldn&#39;t have custody of a child was on point. On a separate note, what kind of handcuffing job was that?"
"&quot;You are under arrest&quot;<br>&quot;No I&#39;m not!!!&quot;<br><br>She said the magic words, the cops HAVE to let her go now."
"It’s insane how people refuse to take any accountability. Don’t ever give her son back to her, she’s unfit to be a mom."
&quot;You&#39;re under arrest!&quot; ......&quot;No I&#39;m not&quot;<br>&quot;You&#39;re going to jail!&quot; ......&quot;No I&#39;m not&quot;<br>&quot;I have a video of you trying to run me over!&quot; .......&quot;No you don&#39;t&quot; 😅😅😅
She actually said the Officers were psychos. Zero self awareness or accountability. Ugh🙄🙄🙄
I hope the father has custody of the son…. I love how people think they are above the law…STUPIDITY IS RUNNING RAMPANT IN THIS COUNTRY!!!!!
Keep this woman away from those children at all costs
I’m amazed she’s lived this long… she has the critical thinking and self preservation skills of an 8pc McNugget.
&quot;This is what happens to me every f*cking time!&quot; I wonder why...
Both these women are nuts.
"I want to take this opportunity to thank my own mother for never ramming cop cars, never fighting cops and rolling around and screaming on the ground, never tried to run over a cop and never did anything worth getting tazed for."
"Seriously, how do these people make real life decisions and function on a daily basis??"
Oh why are people like this please STOP ACTING LIKE A BRAT. I think her son is safer where he is at
I’m always in awe when people say “let me go” after having the cuffs on.
I will never understand why people think they don&#39;t have to comply when the police give instructions.
The art of making things so much more complicated than they have to be.
unbelievable she held onto her phone the whole time until she was tazed and then she claims she did nothing wrong
"So she genuinely thinks that she was doing nothing wrong by blocking her child&#39;s father&#39;s car into a parking spot, not allowing him to leave? She&#39;s confused as to why the police were there, acting as though &quot;they started it&quot; like she was just walking down the street peacefully and the cop came charging at her? <br><br>Top tier gaslighter - feel horrible for her child&#39;s father."
"Please NEVER allow her unsupervised visitation with her innocent son. She&#39;s the PROBLEM, not the husband, not the police but KAYLA! SERIOUS MENTAL, BEHAVIORAL AND ANGER MANAGEMENT ISSUES, THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED ASAP."
That sister has totally done this before and will do it again. Lying and acting hysterical is second nature to both of them.
"&quot;I&#39;m so scared of this man that I followed him in my car, blocked him in, stayed in close proximity, and prevented him from contacting police.&quot;"
The female officer summed up all the arrests on this channel-<br>&quot;Its because you act like that&quot;
You know the father is kicking himself for ever sleeping with her
"She&#39;s ramming police cars, glass is breaking, she&#39;s screaming, wrestling away and all the while.....that phone is protected at all costs."
If she ever wanted custody of her child she lost it right here. Completely out of control.
"“You’re under arrest”<br>“No, I’m not”<br>Oh, okay. Be on your way then."
"Getting tased twice, wrestled to the ground and put in cuffs. Somehow there is still a part in her brain that tells her that she isnt arrested."
Too crazy to raise a child.
“You’re an abuser!”<br>For…..doing his job? Lady you were given a generous amount of warnings 😂
Show me how you lose custody of your kid without telling me how you lose custody of your kid.
Girl whatever meds you’re on ain’t working
"A Father trying to protect his child from the abuse of his mother is Admiral... She has issues, she doesn&#39;t need this child around this chaos of hers."
Hope the dad is more stable &amp; gets custody of those kids fr 🤦🏽‍♀️😔
"Imagine making a lifelong mistake of marrying this woman and having a kid with her -  to be stuck having to deal with, talk to, associate with, etc... for years and years and years and years. Sorry to that dude."
"The fact that this all centers around her child makes me hope very, very strongly that she&#39;s not granted physical custody.  She is deeply unhinged."
She appears unable to provide a safe environment for a child.
I can&#39;t believe her husband didn&#39;t want to stay married to her
Our law enforcement don&#39;t get paid enough to deal with these people!
"Not listening to anything, calling family for back up, ramming two police cars and almost running over an officer. And she calls them psychos....... 🤔🙄"
"Lady officer is a boss! Even takes the time to look left for oncoming traffic before turning onto the road. Gets in place right on time! What a cool, calm, collected officer!"
She should absolutely never have any rights to see her kid. She’s obviously unstable.
"She needs to be admitted either to a mental hospital or jail, she’s going to seriously hurt someone. He needs to get custody of his son she’s too unstable."
“You are an abuser!!” - AFTER ramming TWO police cars and almost KILLING the female officer 🙄
As a Florida native I am glad that Ohio is starting to overtake my home state in the realm of insanity. lol
No need to say ALLEGEDLY. We&#39;re all watching the same thing as you.
Give the dad full sole custody and a restraining order on the mom to stay far away from them and put her in a psych ward
"Wow...two insane sisters. Great job, parents!!!"
Speaks volumes about why he wanted to file a police report.
"I saw the full arrest on another channel. She and her ex-husband are embroiled in a child custody case. The judge awarded her ex-husband full temporary legal and possessory custody for the time being based on her unstable and erratic behavior. He went to court to file paperwork for permanent sole custody and she blocked him with her car to try to keep him from doing so. He called the police. Over the years I’ve watched hundreds of cases, and to date her level of entitlement puts her in the top three of the most entitled people I have ever watched. Notice that she doesn’t think she must obey any laws or legal commands. I sincerely hope her ex-husband uses this video in court."
Trying to flee the scene and hitting two cruisers is not “doing nothing.”
I had an aunt who was like this. She never got better. Just lost everything and somehow it was still everyone else’s fault.
I hope this woman gets zero custody.
Bizarre how certain types of people have come to believe the law is only for other people. The entitlement is astonishing.
"He definitely does NOT need to give you your son, acting like that. I&#39;d be ashamed to have her as a mom."
"This woman is beyond delusional, and dad needs full custody.  This is not how you handle things."
"If she thinks that she&#39;s gonna get her son, that&#39;s ultimately NOT gonna be happening now"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=993"">16:33</a> Respect for women officer for maintaining humanity and dealing with the chaos at the same time."
Hopefully she isn&#39;t getting custody anytime soon.
&quot;You are under arrest!&quot;<br>&quot;No I&#39;m not!&quot;<br>&quot;You are going to jail!&quot;<br>&quot;No I&#39;m not!&quot;<br>I wonder how many times in the history of the world that has actually worked 🤣
“He wont let me see my son” Gee I wonder why
31? Looks like she&#39;s 49 with twelve kids.
She doesn&#39;t behave like an adult screams and shouts she shouldn&#39;t be aloud to drive she is a danger to other people on the road. She needs to grow up and stop behaving like a toddler
Amazing how she thinks she did absolutely nothing wrong. She isn’t fit to be a mom right now. Thank goodness for dad stepping up. He’s so calm. Moms unhinged
This woman has a great combo: detached from reality and an anxiety disorder.
WTF is wrong with people?!?!😮
<b>Cop shows up and IMMEDIATELY says:</b><br><b>&quot;Roll the window down or I&#39;m going to pull you out.&quot;</b><br><b>He was ready to shut this matter down ASAP. LoL!</b>
We live in a place and time where citizens actually believe they are in charge of every situation when dealing with law enforcement. Amazing.
"Geez, even the lady officer tried so hard to keep the situation calm... repeatedly trying to calm the woman down. Unbelievable."
"She disobeys, then rams her car into the police cruisers but then immediately screams in terror as if she really did not think there would be consequences?"
I like how she manages to never let go of her phone throughout her arrest.
The fact that this woman spends any time around a child is a horrifying notion. She shouldn’t be in charge of a GOLDFISH.
Has saying &quot;no I&#39;m not&quot; when a cop says &quot;you&#39;re going to jail&quot; ever really worked?
Kayla&#39;s therapist is facing unimaginable difficulties. Godspeed you unfortunate soul.
Censoring the tasering? Downvote.
"Where has this delusional entitlement came from? She almost strikes one officer, then causes criminal damage to another officers vehicle hit&#39;s a second vehicle. And for some reason while being a danger to public safety screams at officers who have ample reason to arrest her, to stay away from her? yeah... that&#39;s not how it works for criminals. Her sister screaming &quot;I need to calm her down&quot; is ridiculous She is 31 and should know how to act appropriately in public. The officers did nothing she turned a minor incident into something far worse."
That’s really gonna help your case in the dispute over custody of your child too.
Have to give the officer credit for being one of the more efficient at window breaking
"It always baffles me when the cops tell people they’re under arrest, and they say, no I’m not."
"She does everything possible so that the police will be forced to put hands-on her, but it&#39;s all their fault<br> They&#39;re  abusers. What a psycho"
I don&#39;t think the lil sis understands how lucky she truly was
Gives new meaning to the word &quot;hysteria.&quot;
Respect to all officers who deal with these people.
She mentioned seeing her therapist. How’s that working out for you? 😳
OVI=&quot;Operating a Vehicle While Impaired&quot; for our non US viewers
Is this the first time she’s ever experienced the outside world? Jeez
Her attempt to manipulate the police is disgusting. &quot;I don&#39;t feel safe&quot;. She&#39;s the unsafe one.
"&quot;you guys set me up&quot; all you had to do was roll your window down, everything after that is on you. Absolutely no accountability whatsoever."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=425"">7:05</a> This officer is brilliant. She knew exactly what needed to be done and without a moment to spare; that could have been a pedestrian or another moving vehicle. Wow."
Her sister screaming Kayla stop! made me sad😢. She knows her sister is not making the best decisions.
"If it were another country, she may have been warned once or twice at most."
"Broken window, dragged onto the pavement, tasered but she still keeps ahold of that phone."
"She shouldn’t have custody of herself, let alone a child."
"&quot;You are under arrest!&quot; &quot;No, I&#39;m not&quot; What planet do these people come from???"
"Kayla needs a psychiatric eval, ASAP. And an accountability transplant."
Karen:My hand is gonna break again <br>Officer: life&#39;s choices 😂
That female cops was trying to be so nice to this whacko.
"In the history of law enforcement &quot;let me go, i am not doing anything&quot; has never worked."
“I already talked to my therapist today…” <br>Forget the therapist &amp; just go with Thorazine &amp; a padded room until her son is a grown adult.
"Reminds me of the type of craziness I put up with. Trying to allow my son&#39;s mom in their lives. I finally got enough of the lies, drugs, cheating, and other drama. Of her being an irresponsible, neglectful parent and ran her off. Got full custody and raised them alone."
Sister should have gone to jail.  What a piece of work!
"Officer, you were making my sister face the consequences of her actions. You aren&#39;t supposed to do that to people like us.<br><br>Guarantee you that&#39;s what little sister meant."
"Well, I hope the courts give the dad full care and custody of the child… if she is that unhinged then she doesn’t need to be around any child."
Remembered those kids at Wal-Mart crying their lugs out. Well this is them 15yrs later. 😂
They really need to reopen mental hospitals.
"People should have to undergo a psychological evaluation in order to get a drivers license and in order to keep it they should have to do a repeat evaluation every 5 years, and this woman is precisely why."
I can&#39;t stand these kinds of people.
SO OVER the fake fear.
This girl should not be around any children and just because you take medicine doesn&#39;t make you above the law
These people are downright scary.
All that screaming and hysterics and refusing to comply with an officer. I&#39;m not surprised the father won&#39;t let her see her son.
The ex husband is now a firm believer in never sleep with anyone crazier than you.
👩‍💻🇺🇲The sister showing up escalated the situation. Stay home next time.
“You’re under arrest.” <br>“NO I’M NOT!” 🤣🤣😂😂
This psycho CANNOT be responsible for a child! She&#39;s right over the edge!
I don&#39;t think her medication was working.
Can&#39;t imagine why the dad would keep the child away from her. 🙄
As a psychologist I would petition her six months for mental health care.
"31, and acting like a child!! Causing a lot of issues and wasting taxpayer money! Whiny self absorbed ridiculous behavior! Poor sister got pulled into  her craziness!!"
"&quot;Quit trying to turn this around on me&quot;<br><br>Lady, you are the problem of all of this. What a pyschopath, I hope she never sees her son."
&quot;Those cops are psychos!&quot;<br><br>Apparently this is Kayla&#39;s world. We&#39;re all just living in it.
"I COULD NOT BE A POLICEMAN, NEVER ."
"I have to wonder why on earth he would file a complaint against that lovely, gentle passive woman."
Wow she really is totally out of her mind.. look at all the chaos she caused
Another woman who has never ever faced consequences for her behavior and has been reacting this way since childhood. Clearly these tantrums are nothing new for her. This is what happens when behaviors of childhood continue into adulthood.
I hate it when a person thinks they&#39;re so entitled they don&#39;t have to do what a police officer asks them to do.
Omg. She continues to act like the &quot;victim&quot; and she is the dangerous one. I hope that her kids are kept away from her. She definitely doesn&#39;t seem fit to raise any children.
"That childish temper tantrum screaming at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=293"">4:53</a> ... This woman is insane."
Smart work from the female office.
"Once you give Morgan &amp; Morgan your case, don’t expect to hear from anyone anytime soon"
Entitled isn&#39;t the first word I&#39;d use to describe her. More like delusional.
Yikes! We’re surrounded by truly scary people! 😮
Such an embarrassing time to be an  American. So many adults acting like  children.
Histerically resisting arrest seems to be a well established tradition in the US...
"Her sister is a mess as well, what about the dad? That kid may not have any hope."
"I love it when they say you’re under arrest and then the person says oh no, I’m not"
Kids should never be able to be around her
"Men, stop picking up the easy ones in the bar."
"The sister throws a fit when cop tells her she&#39;s going to jail for interfering. She really goes nuts over this news so he asks her if she&#39;s ever going to do this again? She babbles No. He lets her out. So now, she thinks all she has to do is act like a 5 y o and they&#39;ll let her off."
"So many narcissistic traits on display here. Deflecting, minimalising, gaslighted, blaming everyone else but herself."
&quot;You are under arrest&quot;.  No I&#39;m not.   &quot;You are going to jail.&quot;  No I&#39;m not.    I just love the delusion.
You&#39;re under arrest. No I&#39;m not. Sounds like me arguing with my little brother
This woman can&#39;t ever take responsibility for her actions. She did this all on her own.
"This menace tried to run over Officer Olivia, and that’s completely uncalled for. What a monster."
Dad needs to go file a TPO
Her behavior is shocking! She mentioned she&#39;d been arrested before so it seems like she knows the score.
Her &quot;therapist&quot; should have his license revoked.
EMTS must be sick and tired of perps trying to blame the cops.
I despise when women play the victim after they&#39;re clearly the ones that created the situation in the first place
One of over a million reasons why I chose to stay single...
This lady is wilding out! 😂
that escalated quickly
Our thoughts and prayers go out to anyone who has been in contact with this woman &quot;Ever&quot;
These officers need an instant raise! But three statements to roll down your window is the limit.
I couldn&#39;t imagine having to deal with people like this on a daily basses.
Allegedly rammed two cops cars? She for sure ran into two cop cars.
"She&#39;s ramming police cars, glass is breaking, she&#39;s screaming, wrestling away and all the while.....that phone is protected at all costs.  😂😂😂"
It is truly amazing to me how many people these days cannot do ANYTHING without their cell phone clutched in their mitts.
💯 someone who doesn’t need a child
"Gee, I wonder what her medication is for?"
&quot;Quit trying to turn this around on me&quot; is wild😂😂
How many cops does it need to deal with one hysterical woman?
She sure hung on to that phone. lol
The decline of society.
&quot;The jail won&#39;t let you have your phone&quot;<br>&quot;That&#39;s not really MY phone&quot;<br>.....uhm...do you really think that will change anything? There is something very wrong with the reasoning portion of this girl&#39;s brain
I can&#39;t believe how amazing these cops are.
"Sister should have gotten atleast 30 days for interference,  dangerous for both parties when the cop can&#39;t keep his attention on one person"
She is playing the poor little victim.
She&#39;s not seeing her son anytime soon
i truly hope for the dad&#39;s sake the court gives him full custody and a restraining order
It’s just not that hard. Follow the instructions from police and they treat you fairly. That’s it.
"OMG this entitled woman is just ridiculous!!! All she had to do is get out of her car, simple action. She is full of drama!!!"
I am so sick of people acting like this because the people that pay their taxes are the ones gonna be paying for the patrol car repair.
Something deeply wrong with her.
"The guy is like, does everybody believe me now that she is crazy?!!"
Threatning to snap while handcuffed in back or cruiser has never workd
She is definitely cra-cra!
"As soon as a another car is needed that should be a $500 fine.  Resisting orders should be $1000.  Car damages, ambulance call etc.  she should be billed and put against her credit with no possibility of bankruptcy."
Feel sorry for the child.  Why can’t parents work things out and think of their children.
&quot;This is what always happens to me.&quot; It would seem that she is having a difficult time comprehending cause and effect.
"There Are Probably a Lot of Us watching her make an Absolute Fool of herself, Who are Laughing Out Loud at her stupidly!!😅😅😅"
Was the son she hit witnessing this?  Total lunatic!
"Remember when people used to cooperate with the police? &quot;Yes, officer. Ok, officer.&quot;"
She’s a control freak. Her way or else.
"Say it ONCE, then TAKE ACTION. Stop treating drivers like babies."
Gee I can’t imagine why they aren’t letting her see her son. He is clearly better off for it she is absolutely nutters
She obviously is sick and should neither be allowed to have custody nor a drivers licence until she is better!
&quot;Quit trying to turn this around on me&quot; says the totally unhinged woman! 🙄
Be picky of whom you have children with.
Kayla&#39;s tutorial on &quot;how to ruin your life in 10 seconds and give your ex everything he needs for full custody&quot;
These type of people  ALWAYS have their phones in their hands. They start the drama and play the victim the entire time.
The result of 50 &quot; last warnings &quot;
"I’m so glad the father is going to the police regularly about her behavior, because this woman is dangerous. People do terrible things when relationships end, and if she’s willing to block that man from leaving his car and ramming his vehicle IN FRONT OF POLICE, she’s likely capable of worse. I hope that father stays safe."
Entitled much?
I truly hope she never gets custody of those kids.
Great way to get your son back.
There&#39;s apparently something in blue and pink hair dye that kills braincells
"Seeing how the sister acts just like her, it’s definitely how they were raised unfortunately"
It&#39;s the &quot;I&#39;m not doing anything&quot;that killed me😆
"Every time I watch first responders in these situations, I FEEL THAT THEY MUST REALLY LIKE SERVING AND PROTECTING US!❤❤❤ THANK YOU ALL🎉🎉🎉❤😊"
"Dude you didn’t even show the first taser, showing your ad instead? What gives?"
Dont think you have to use allegedly. She literally does it on video 😂
"Kayla&#39;s severe, screaming over reaction makes her sound emotionally disturbed"
lol well her ex will get full custody now 🤣😂
“Im not doing anything!!!” -Proceeds to do EVERYTHING.
"My goodness, Kayla was EXTREMELY dislikeable"
&quot;Dont let that man near me&quot; as shes blocking him in and not a single tear was shedding prior.
Entitled Karen  All she had to do was talk to the cop.  She made it ten times worse for herself
"&quot;Wow, you guys did it again&quot;<br><br>I need her as my lawyer"
Some people have never been punched in the face and it shows.
"Gets dealt with and never dropped that phone , impressive ."
"They closed the mental hospitals down and this is what we have walking among us, on the roads, etc."
She’s a problem
The clown 🤡  hair gives it away from the jump. 🤣
It blows my mind that there are so many people in this world that act like this.
She’s done nothing but escalate a situation. She just made her mess messier. Nasty!
"Between Ohio &amp; Wisconsin, something bad is in the Midwestern waters."
“Keep him away from me.” But she has him blocked in. 😂
So embarrassingly frustrating when people like her immediately start crying and claim that the cops are trying to hurt her and claim they already did “the other day” lol
Whatever happened to respect??
Allegedly?  She hit two cruisers…
We have to pray that the son doesn’t have any mental illness.
Waiting this long to take physical action is ridiculous.
"This is the second video ive seen on utube today like this.  Is the world loosing its mind?  Its scary how to avoid these people, and sad for police who have to deal with this irrational  behavior."
But never puts the phone down. Impressive
She asks for it. Poor guy shares a kid with her 😢
She’s lucky she didn’t get shot acting like around cops. A car is a deadly weapon.
Did she really say &quot;I&#39;m not doing anything!&quot; ?????😂
Cop at the end &quot;You&#39;ve dealt with me a million times.&quot; Girlypop is a frequent customer. Wonder what else she&#39;s been up to? 😂
I feel sorry for the father of her child. 18 years of dealing with this psych case.
"What is an emotional unstable person doing driving a motor vehicle, that is the first question."
She needs SERIOUS MENTAL CARE
Cops gave that woman way too many chances and it escalated.
all she had to do was comply and get out of her car. Why all the unnecessary and ridiculous drama ?
"She is such a polite, considerate, well-mannered lady..<br>Do not understand why the police tackled her in the past.   Stupidity and entitlement abounding. The child does not need crazy in his life"
It’s interesting to see officers not give endless chances before escalating unlike other videos I’ve seen
Wish I could see her day in Court
Why tf are your videos edited? There’s no need for the interruptions! A video says a million words!
When I say i am not when told I am under arrest I say no I am not lol.
Why are you blocking us watching the taser. Shame on you!
She just lost custody of her son.
"Man, that last cop that talked to her was the best. &quot;The decision has been made.&quot; Calm and collected and straight to the point."
So now we know the truth. Dad is protecting his son and mom just wants the child support.
"Oh no, a woman is crying. She must be the victim."
"This isn’t going to look very well for custody <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=358"">5:58</a>"
Why do these people have children? Children have to be traumatized. Smh
Omg! How many people in this country need mental health help!! She&#39;s doing everything that&#39;s going to get her a bunch of charges! Those cops are sick of her!
"Officers, I&#39;m so terribly sorry you have to handle situations like this 😮"
Love when people tell the cops they&#39;re not arresting them 😂
This girl has been this way her whole life!! It’s starts with the parents!!!  She needs to be checked!!!!!  DUMBA-S
"The cops were amazing. But in the interest of perserving the dignity of another human being, Kaye was acting on the love of her son. She&#39;s messed up and is too delusional  to realize that its her choice of bad behaviors that led to this. Clearly, the son belongs with the father, but this woman probably lost custody of her child forever because of this and other bad behaviors.  This is a tremendous loss, and I feel sorry for the child most of all. Let&#39;s try to remember Kayla is a person and throw her a scrap of dignity."
Quit doing 5 cutaways just show the damn clip
How does she function in the world? I suppose this shows that she doesn&#39;t 🤷‍♂
Entitlement is out of control these days.
"always playing the victim, while thinking they&#39;re the ones in control when the reality is the opposite on both."
"Wow crime is rampant in that hotspot of, where? Alliance Ohio?"
Why do people think that their phones are magic wand?
Clearly never told no or dont. Never held accountable. Never given consequences. Never given boundaries. Just an out &amp; out brat. This woman is our future?! We are all screwed!!!
&quot;Do not let them near me&quot; she says as she&#39;s blocking him from leaving. FFS.
I can&#39;t imagine why the father doesn&#39;t want their child around her.
“You’re going to jail” <br>“NO I’M NOT!”<br><br>Sorry sweetie it doesn’t work that way  😂😂
“I called the Sheriff so therefore the Police have no authority”.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=720"">12:00</a> I like how she still believes she’s not going to jail after all that 💀"
"The victim who did/does nothing wrong is extremely strong with this one!! <br><br>I’ve never seen the amount and level of gaslighting in a video before that this clown does!! Everything single thing that happened/happens, she immediately deflects and turns it around on the other person! 🙄"
"If you ever think you had it bad because your parents were too strict on you or disagreed with you on some things, just remember that some people have to grow up with parents like this..."
"I&#39;ve been in custody/detained/arrested 7 or 8 times in my life. Never at any moment, even when drunk, could I even imagine fighting back at all. Let alone screaming like a banshee and telling the cops how it&#39;s going to go."
Her child needs to be kept far FAR away from her.
Did she think ramming a police car was a solid idea?
She is a stalker and an abuser.  She should not have a drivers license and probably should lose her freedom until her obsession wears out over the man she was stalking.
Police was not wrong...she was wrong
"The woman may be in the wrong..... but those officers condescending, and bickering back and forth with her, like oh yes you did, oh no you didn&#39;t.... where is the professionalism"
Shame on officers........they were to gentle to her..........
How do people like this even get a driver’s license???
At what point did people get this mentally weak. It&#39;s an epidemic all the sudden
She should not be allowed her children back for any reason
"Rams two police cars, nearly runs over an officer, refuses to leave her car, cusses at the officers, fights them, has to be Tased twice... <br>OFFICER: &quot;You are under arrest, you are going to jail.&quot;<br>KAYLA: (Screaming) &quot;No I am not!!! For what?&quot;"
"Narcissistic personalities are the worst of the worst.<br><br>&quot;No, I&#39;m not being arrested&quot;..<br>&quot;No, I&#39;m Not going to jail&quot;.. <br><br>Grow up !!<br>Smdh.. 😞"
Praying this woman never sees her kids again 🙏
I just don’t understand how someone that wants to see her kid so bad thinks any of what she did or said was going to help her achieve that.
"My, my, my, how she does love the drama.  She basks in, and foments, the horrible drama she&#39;s putting her family through.  This could have easily escalated into people getting seriously hurt."
I will take this opportunity to point out that the video does NOT show her getting tased as those parts have been edited out.
Finally a cop that doesn’t waste time and gets the job done. I see so many of these Karen videos where the cops are there for an hour trying to talk sense into these lunatics
Never believe when she crys and screams at the same time
Yeah she’s definitely not getting her kids back now.
"Well, it’s clearest day that she doesn’t need custody of her son"
They were a lot more patient than I would have been.
"You can&#39;t be a woman cop without several arm tattoos and preferably full sleeves, it&#39;s a requirement to look gangster and less feminine."
Wow. History of this behavior and she is surprised to get arrested.
How does she function on a daily basis?
She has no business being around children. She is a danger to them and to herself.
What an insane woman!  She said she went through this with police last week!  Insanity is doing the same thing over and over  again and expecting different results!
This woman is extremely dramatic.
Pink hair says it all!
"This is how they usually act when they don’t get their way. It’s not a Karen thing, this is their default.  entitled and playing victim"
"I wonder how many people she has made false claims against. Her past should be reviewed for the damages she has caused,"
You’re under arrest. Karen: No I’m not!
...she found out
Somebody raised these two daughters well.
"That other women received an absurd amount of leniency. Of course, that&#39;s just my expert unprofessional opinion.😂"
Ohio has surpassed Florida. This truly is one of the moment.
Mental
Give her 60 days in jail😡😡
"Oh for gosh sake, let her go ... she told you she&#39;s not under arrest. Snap to, lady and gents! <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hcMfY5_zAbbxvwKLooCoCA""></a>"
Her poor kid…
"Cop: &#39;You&#39;re going to jail.&#39; She: &#39;No, I won&#39;t!&#39; - Someone tell her the truth.&quot; 🤦‍♀<br>&quot;Maybe she needs a course in &#39;police manners&#39;.&quot; 📚"
"Does she say &quot;I&#39;ve got that no contact order with the Mayor&quot; at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=1010"">16:50</a>????"
"Perhaps her behavior is out of control, because she screams “give me my meds” when things aren’t going her way. Maybe she should act like an adult and work through the situation and learn some self control."
She dared to crash into a police car? Horrible! She seemed completely out of control. Kudos to the officers for handling the situation so professionally.
"Ahhhh, there it is; the famous, &quot;No I&#39;m not!&quot; when they&#39;re being told that they are arrested. That fail proof get out of jail card always works!"
I&#39;ve lived in several states and one other country;  I SWEAR Ohio is the strangest State Ive ever lived in.
&quot;Allegedly&quot;?      Thumbs down for that.
Allegedly rammed into cruiser??
31 going on 3 and a half.
Why can’t ppl like Kayla act normal?  Why can’t you follow commands? She’s acting like a brat without respect to authority. You try to control situations.
"the sister screaming when she rams the car, as if they were doing something to her. Psycho was caught in the act of stalking the guy, ramming a cop car and she still thinks it&#39;s everyone else. and is her medication something to replace a narcotic?"
"She didn’t even care her child is there, she is dangerous and irresponsible, very unstable."
Only in ohio
hilarious
The father of her child definitely needs to be careful that woman is dangerous
"“This just happened”<br><br>If there is a last time, maybe you need to consider that your behavior is problematic and you need to change it. Instead, she’s gonna tell everyone it’s the cops that’s the problem."
Female cop is dope
This is the same Kayla that rear ends a car while delivering food and was screaming at the cops. She also called 911 then hung up in another video.
"when in trouble, get on your phone and scream"
"I actually feel sorry for this lady, she desparately needs professional help !"
Final Boss Karen.
Crazyy
Wow what is wrong with this lady. Her phone should not  be an issue at the point of her being arrested
"trump state, enough said"
Aren&#39;t they all entitled?
&#39;Entitled’ Ohio Woman Gets Tased After Allegedly Ramming Police Cars -&gt; Entitled Ohio Woman Gets Tased After &#39;Allegedly&#39; Ramming Police Cars<br>fixed the title for you
A straitjacket might be a handy accessory in the back of a patrol vehicle.
"What is wrong with this lady?  I do feel the police were heavy handed, but all she had to do was roll her window down and be respectful."
"She is so full of fun, lard and drugs. A keeper!"
Both need to go to jail for at least 30 years each!
That girl did NOTHING wrong but love her sister. I don’t think that cop would understand that.
I find it hard to believe that such a sweet mom would have trouble with her son&#39;s father. I believe in some cases that mental health is real...and this woman is a case.
"Cops stop bullying nice ladies! Typical, cops tormenting nice citizens!😅"
We all know she is woke 😂 she not afraid to show it
"Don&#39;t get married, don&#39;t have children and you should be fine."
Sister shouldn&#39;t have been released.
She brought All of this on herself!!!
&quot;You&#39;re under arrest!&quot;<br><br>&quot;No I&#39;m not!&quot;<br><br>Works every time.
"If you&#39;re this crazy screaming about your &#39;medicine&#39;, you shouldn&#39;t be out driving a car.  These people need babysitters."
This officer is out of control.  Taser for not going on belly isn&#39;t policing.  It is full on a-hole.
"Needing to use double cuffs because a person is so overweight that they cannot move their body normally, is sad. It also seems so common, It&#39;s a wonder they don&#39;t start standard-issuing &quot;plus sized&quot; cuffs."
"man its always the same..&quot;cop for like the 8th time. Ma&#39;am open up or im gonna do it by force.&quot; woman- &quot;...no, im busy&quot; five seconds later &quot; FOR NO REASON!!!!!!!!!&quot;"
Look what they did to me last time. You’ve got a great track record honey
So this 31 year old woman calls her sister to deliberately and deceptively start recording after she clearly drove away when denied all request to keep the male officer away to simply make it seem as if the officers were &quot;abusing her&quot; as she acts like she is terrified of them...Does this woman know both officers are also recording....
"Firearms are not yellow, and you don&#39;t call out &quot;tazer&quot; when deployed."
I&#39;m taking a poll:<br>Is this woman a maniac or<br>Is this just the everyday behavior of an American mother these days?
Someone give her her medication!
&quot;Look at my hands?&quot; Were they all nice and clean and she didn&#39;t want to have to rewash?
If her story about cops tackling her is even real then I’m willing to bed she was being difficult and uncooperative then as well.
This is what drugs do to someone else mentality.
Why are you using the word allegedly here? It&#39;s literally in the video we&#39;re watching.
Your sister came there to &quot;save you&quot;? 🤨🤣🤦🏽
The absolute stupidity of some people is amazing 😂
He did pull a gun on her. That was messed up. He quickly switched to the TASER.
Lmao that woman police officer was beyond useless
I cant stand watching anymore! No wonder shits out of hand!
Tinnitus. how many police officers have Tinnitus after an intervention like this😵‍💫
I thought pot was legal in Ohio? Kayla definately needs some!
"Dang, someone got her pregnant. Poor guy."
&quot;He needs to stay away from me&quot; <br><del>points at the female officer</del> <br>😂 <br><del>lady officer proceeds to turn into a super hero in GTA</del>
"NOW, SHE REALLY HAS PTSD"
Im glad i dont act like this thanks to my family teaching me acting like this is wrong and to act civil with the police
"Wow, how sad! My heart goes out to this young lady who obviously has some sort of mental issues. I sincerely things work out for her. I also want to commend all the Police Officers and EMS involved for their professionalism and patience while dealing with her."
"Bro literally pulled his gun on an unarmed civilian at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=328"">5:28</a>. Totally unacceptable."
Nobody’s laughing at you!  (I am! )😂
I have no clue why he wants to take the kid away.....
"Gee, I can&#39;t imagine why she thought she deserved a pass on ramming a police car!?"
"I think the new police moto should be...&quot;Act like a toddler, you&#39;re ridin&#39; with us!&quot; 🤣"
lol last time too … SHE NEEDS to STAY HOME
"She&#39;s completely unhinged,  caused this disaster of a scene with damage,  won&#39;t take accountability, and wants her kid as if thats safe. And then tries to say it&#39;s the cops fault. I don&#39;t blame the dad for keeping the kid safe. Crazy."
i guess you cant say &#39;&#39;only in ohio&#39;&#39;
What planet of delusion were these two women raised on? Just ignore and refuse orders from police and behave any crazy way you want with no.consequence?  Parents did a great job with these two. Is it too late to charge them?
"“so she’s got attempted vehicular assault, obstruction,..”<br>“YOURE LYING it’s on your bodycam!!”<br>“…yes.”🤯"
"I hope the father shows this video to the judge , they take away any custody from her , only be allowed Supervised visits  ...   OMG to have a parent like this  !!"
"Highlight of the video<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=528"">8:48</a> LOL thinks if she keeps saying &quot;LEMME GO&quot; that they will listen hahaha<br><br>Says &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything wrong&quot; after disobeying lawful commands and rammed into a police vehicle... and wrecklessly driving over a crub..   <br><br>After all that... &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything wrong!&quot;"
I seriously dont understand the screaming woman in the background?? She is literally causing herself personal trauma by freaking out..
Christ. Arrested emotional development. Our society seems to promote that.
"idk about y&#39;all, but i find it very telling as to what shes like as a mother when she says &#39;he needs to give me my son&#39; &#39;i want my son&#39; &#39;you can&#39;t take my son away from me&#39;. also, her insistence that she&#39;s not on drugs when nobody even MENTIONED drugs or alcohol is the cherry on top of what you need to know. hope her little boy is safe and okay.<br><br>update; oh she literally tattled on herself mentioning drugs before she even got charged with OVI lmao."
"31??? I clocked her at 51, easy. <br>I guess being that awful ages you."
The colored hair tells me everything I need to know about this suspect.
"You’re about to be tased, and your window smashed. What a great time to hve a conversation on your phone! 🙄"
&quot;get him away from me!!&quot; while she is the one keeping him trapped... the delusion is insane
Bad rendition of Let Me Go which was originally done by Joan Webber.
Wow and she didn&#39;t get shot and she&#39;s still alive? 🤔 Imagine that. So the police don&#39;t always have to use lethal force when their lives are actually in danger.
"What kind of a demented simpleton replies, &quot;No I&#39;m not!&quot;, to the statement, &quot;You&#39;re under arrest.&quot;?"
I&#39;m thinking her visitation with those kids didn&#39;t increase
"What I can&#39;t get is HOW would she have been able to block someone from calling the police, as alleged? I think I smell a walloping great RAT."
They really need to reopen mental health institutions
"It&#39;s funny when they ask,&quot;what did I do?&quot; Or I didn&#39;t do anything wrong&quot;."
This girl lives in a different reality. Thank you for your service officers. Sorry you have to deal with these lunatics and then go home to your normal family after that.
"welp, she&#39;s never getting her kid back now"
"This cop has anger issues, entitled or not"
&quot;you&#39;re under arrest&quot; &quot;NO I&#39;M NOT&quot; &quot;oh sorry my mistake&quot;
All this i dont trust or are afraid of cops. Is really getting old. I bet u though if she needed them for something. She wouldn&#39;t be afraid of them. Only when u r 8n trouble
When the police say to you I promise you lol your going FAFO
So we have to have adds plus listen to dude talk also. Not worth watching this channel.. extra
"I think this girl is having a nervous breakdown, it always seems like when a couple breaks up they always use the children for leverage. I really don’t know what to say but her behavior isn’t making the situation any better. It’s the children caught up in this madness that will suffer."
"Shame on that Mother,she almost hurt the officers."
Sharing a video online of a person&#39;s worse day benefits no one.  All to make a few bucks.
This is how to dig a deeper hole. Don&#39;t comply with a single order.
It&#39;s almost a guarantee that anyone who says &quot;I know my rights&quot; certainly does not.
"It’s like these people have never heard of police before, or the idea that you might be responsible if you commit a crime."
That ladycop (Olivia?) is badass. Reminds me of my sister before she quit the army and got married.
"She likes the drama and the attention of all these people, which is paid for by the taxpayer. That is why she should have to pay fines that cover the cost of all this."
Delusion is a powerful problem in that family...
Wow. She should never be left alone with kids never mind have custody over them. Mental case.
"Lol tbh, those are some cool body cams..  Friggin FPS view haha"
Somebody had a child with her. The nightmare.
Why is it okay for the officers to use the F bomb?
The male officer seriously  gave that other women who interfered a critical learning experience 👌 that situation would have been bad- super bad
"Why are they picking on that poor,  innocent lady? She cooperated with all your commands. I want your badge #.......<br>😂"
"A law firm as a sponsor for these police videos ---- gee, thanks."
why do the Officers waste that much Time with Psychos ??? that &quot;Entity&quot; shouldn´t even be allowed to drive ... or vote or have Children
"Bad girls, bad girls, whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?"
I wish you needed to pass exams and gain a licence to procreate
she needs to be locked up like right now
You ran me over.  You hit my cruiser? lol  She&#39;s nuts but neither of those things happened
That poor man dealing with this crazy lady
"Rams cop cruisers and says get away from me, smh"
"&quot;you&#39;re under arrest!&quot;<br>&quot;no, I&#39;m not!&quot;<br>&quot;oh ok, sorry ma&#39;am.&quot;"
Holy Crap.<br><br>You Block Out The Tazer<br>You Block Out The Car Ramming<br>You Block Out So Much<br><br>WTH Happened With You Guys?
I believe this is why handcuffs and duct tape were invented.
Nothing is EVER her fault is it!
and she wonders why she cant see her kids
That woman is a couple of sandwiches short of a picnic.
Sooooooo avoidable. Do you really need to make a bad day a worse one?
I hope they don’t give that baby back to her! Smh
The judge says who gets custody of the kids.
This is how I behave on GTA 5 🥴
"people today cannot release the phone, its like a cant live without body part"
The sister crying 😂😂
Just one question why are people like this
I love these head mounted body cameras btw
31???? She looks 48
Who should stay away from who?
I wanna see the court hearings!!!
when keeping it real goes wrong
"This is not fair. she is afraid and scared. or she might just be insecure. this is insane. i hate this. tell me if im wrong, in fact she did nothing, she did not touch any car. this is insane"
I can&#39;t imagine how she lost custody in the first place.
bro stop advertising mid video
Why does she keep repeating every word?
I want to know where all these people came up with this idea that they do not have to listen to the police when they’re pulled over for committing a crime or anything else. There’s nothing in the constitution that says that they do not have to give their information to the police nothing but yet they all say it’s  in the constitution is not.
"Kayla, kayla, kayla. You want your son back? This is NOT how its going to happen. If anything youve just prolonged that one. Now on top of stopping your sons dad from filing YET ANOTHER COMPLAINT against you, you have resisting arrest, assault on a police officer, as well as using your vehicle as a weapon basically. Idk who her therapist or what they told her today but surely it wasnt &quot;Kayla go down to the court house and act like a fool&quot; she dont need no more of her medicine bc ITS NOT WORKING!!"
It’s always the tears for me!! Why not do as asked immediately?!
How do  people get this psychotic to begin with?   Jeeez.
Did I just here her say don&#39;t try and turn this around on me?
"The American police!<br><b>Simply, always, and EVERYWHERE!</b>"
Allegedly?
"Dang, it was like trying to get a witch into church!"
Allegedly?
Because of videos like this I no longer take any woman crying seriously. Always fake and for their advantage.
The drama with this one is strong. . .
Choose your partner wisely folks.
And that people is called &quot;privilege&quot;
yt trash
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=782"">13:02</a> - no lady, YOU have to understand not to act like a fool"
Where do people like this come from?
its not &quot;allegedly&quot; when its on 4k video
Bring back mental asylums
"Always, everyone else&#39;s fault!"
31? she looks 41
My hometown hasn’t changed much
UNBELIEVABLE!
It&#39;s always Ohio or Florida 😂
Get on your belly ! Which one?
She should’ve just complied!!!!
&quot;life&#39;s choices&quot; had me rolling lol
"If she’s really going through what she says, she’s going through, I feel sorry. But unfortunately, you have to adhere to the police, and what they’re asking you to do. You have to get out of a car. You have to listen. Otherwise, unfortunately, we just cannot feel sorry for you. And you look like the guilty party."

No wonder she can&#39;t see her kid
Officer was pretty cool....
I know how the Father feels. He is embarrassed and humiliated because he is on display to the whole world as the guy who got involved with this maniac. This is what happens when little head vetoes the brain. Lots of men have been where you are. Me included.
31 years old? Meth is hella drug.
I couldn&#39;t do this job.  Kudos to the men and women in blue!
All look how they deal with them when they act crazy and misbehave 🤔🙄
"Caught a $100,000 bond."
These videos just infuriate me. There are so many in our society that contribute nothing but require everything.
Another ignorant Karen
Trailer nonsense
They so use too being privileged so when shiz happens they can’t handle it
I hope they show the kids this video.
"&quot;But at least she didn&#39;t cause a scene and went peacefully U Guise!!&quot; 🤔<br>Yeah, uh, right. What an immature womyn."
"i fully believe she got tackled and roughed up the week before, what did she think happened when u acted like this towards cops"
"Criminal crying victim, you need to follow instructions from the police"
I feel SO SORRY for LEOS!!
I do not understand why people say they dont trust cops when all they have to do is listen to them! Just do what they say and it wont escalate.  What are peole thinking
She is the perpetual victim. Everyone is abusing her. No accountability for her own entitled actions.
Perpetual victim.
&quot;tasered me&quot;
"It&#39;s everyone Fault but hers, right?<br>I bet she was a well pampered Child who doesn&#39;t have faced any Consequences for her Action, and now she is a &quot;grown&quot; &quot;Adult&quot; who thinks the World resolve around her.<br>To sad."

That&#39;s most of Ohio woman ♀️
Trying to keep the phone in her hand was just absurd.  She’s crazier than a loon.

"OMG, some people really think they&#39;re the eternal victim. Wow. Lady, please get some therapy. You need it."
i hope everyone she knows sees this.
i&#39;m not doing anything.. famous last wrods
"She says, &quot;You guys do this every time....&quot; as if regular run-ins with the law like this are the norm for everyone 😂<br>Girl, the longest interaction I&#39;ve ever had with police is when one happened to be driving behind me which resulted in a surge of anxiety and my bum remaining clenched till I pulled in my garage 😅 (... and no, he never pulled me over. I think he followed me for a total of, 8 - 10 seconds before he turned off the road)"
"Cop: Get out of the car or you will be arrested”<br>Woman:No<br>Cop: repeats it 100 times <br>Woman:No<br>Cop:Ok<br><br>Wow, a minority dude would’ve been pulled out after the 2nd request and had knee on his back for 30 mins…"

You lost me with the ad.
Why did you do this? Real narcissistic statement. I didn&#39;t have anything to do with the situation so ome one else made me do it.. Crazy!

"I’m always excited when I see you’ve uploaded a new video, you never disappoint!"
"There&#39;s NOOOOO way, she isn&#39;t suffering from some kind of mental health situation... <br>Like really, I&#39;m not being mean when I say this, but I just Can&#39;t see a sane person thinking this wasn&#39;t the consequences of THEIR ACTIONS."
Why is entitled in quotes in the title? The title also states &quot;Allegedly&quot; after IT&quot;S ON VIDEO!!!!!! Hahahahaha! SuperSimp away! Hahahahahah!
The many ADS made this video unwatchable... LESS ADS NEXT TIME
Police Horror. To much crying. Unprofessional police officers. Never would happen in an European country.
"I&#39;m not familiar with OVI, what is it?"
"That male cop failed miserably the De-escalation department, bigtime!!! 🤨"
"Videos like this make the sale of MOTHERS DAY,&quot;THANK YOU&quot; Cards skyrocket way before mothers day."
"“Keep him away from me”, “keep him away from her”…lady you blocked HIM in while HE was trying to file a report. Probably cause you’re a massive psychopath. If there were ever a way to ensure that the ex you hate keeps custody, this would be it."
"Die  ist doch  selbst Schuld  ,was hat ihr  das ganze  Theater  gebracht? Außer  das sie im Internet  ist"
The thing in the red car is A COMPLETE WASTE OF EVERYTHING THAT MAKES A HUMAN A HUMAN.
Liberals.
This mental health act is ridiculous! She just wants everything her way!
I’d like to know what meds she’s on.
"You smashed into two police cars and almost ran over an officer, but you’re not under arrest? Seems legit.🤦‍♀️"
She made things worse. I don&#39;t understand why she didn&#39;t get out the car when the officer asked.
By no means is any fit to have custody any child her own parents failed her
"I truly feel sorry for all the service Personel involved with this Violent, abusive woman. The screaming and the  waste of Public Emergency Services and Law enforcers is ridiculous and she needs to be accountable and do pay back in Community Service. She thinks by screaming and yelling , its OK. I am glad I am not in the Forces . The sheer stress she created on the Law Enforcers is unacceptable. How do the Law and Emergency Service cope at the end of the day. I couldnt cope with that disgusting woman. John (Australia)"
"Pretty obvious that she is very scared of the police from previous interaction with them. She might have mental issues. Contrary to what you all people think, the way the police are treating her is NOT the way to treat a person with mental problems. Then the other woman tries to help her and the police treat her badly too. She needs to take medication prescribed by a Doctor, she is also denied this. I&#39;m sorry to disagree with all you people but I think that the entire situation was NOT handled properly by the police, and then the police tell her they will drag her out if necessary, she is already very scared of them."
No wonder he don&#39;t want her around their kid (which it sounded like was the case)
"And trust me, she doesn&#39;t want her son. She doesn&#39;t want to pay child support. She wants to punish this man, get child support, and turn the kid against his father. Adding another unhappy person to an unhappy bunch of people as it is. She is a sad example of the mother.....shame."
W T F is her problem &amp; theirs for even playing with her for that long?! Just goes to show… nvm.
&quot;You are under arrest!&quot;  &quot;No I&#39;m not&quot;  New rules guys! It&#39;s only to adjust the law.
"Congrats Kayla, now you never kid your and this video lives online for ALL your family, friends and future employers to see!"
"As a teacher, this is why I try so hard to teach my kids to take responsibility and move on. Everything is not worth a fight. This could’ve all been prevented with a little compliance. No need to admit guilt, but being aggressive isn’t gonna get you anyone."
"She said “you guys did it again!” as if she did nothing to warrant being tased. 😂😂 Girl what?? If she just got jumped on a week prior by law enforcement, she was probably behaving the same way then too."
Where are ALL the anti-cop YouTube subscribers yapping about this woman&#39;s &quot;rights&quot;? HAHA!!
Adventures with the &quot;WHACKO SISTERS&quot;!   &quot;Goodbye!&quot;   I feel very sorry for her husband and son as nobody deserves her in their lives.
Entitled woman. This was completely 100% your own fault and I guess the previous altercation was too.
"Every time a video starts with someone saying they don’t trust cops cuz of bad past experiences, I know they are going to resist arrest and blame the police. <br><br>Say it with me “Ther-a-py.”"
The number of people who think legal procedure is dictated by their perceived comfort level is astounding.
"I don&#39;t know how the police put up with people like this on a daily basis. The cop says he has dealt with her a million times...but of course, this isn&#39;t her fault"
"Officer: Your under arrest<br>Woman: No I&#39;m not! <br>Officer: OH OK then , have a nice day"
"K-9 • first the sister, then the lunatic. My goodness, the lunatic has a child. That’s a Code-10 travesty."
I don&#39;t think her auto insurance company will pay for the damages to the police vehicles.
She got tased twice and it&#39;s like nothing!!! Aren&#39;t tased people a bit druggy after ?
It was hilarious 😊when they told her they would cut the handbag off her when she screamed “No!  It’s Baragoni!”😂
"I feel very sorry for her young child..  Seems as if mental illness may run in that family... What a totally over the top disgraceful performance.. The Police officers all showed extreme patience, and acted professionally.. ..  She certainly needs her &#39;medication&#39; as she claimed to the medics.."
Raty than promoting yourself you might start to think about your own safety.<br>Advertising crap.
&gt; the sheriff says you can’t do anything<br><br>Im gonna guess he probably didn’t say that
They should have rock paper scissors who she goes with
"The main take away I’ve gotten from any of these videos is to just listen and obey with the cops. Don’t spiral, just follow instructions. Most people don’t like to do that. 🤷🏼‍♀️"
what she really thinking when she said to cop staying away from me???????
Screaming like that in public should be a misdemeanor at the very least. Causing unnecessary alarm with the result of bringing about public discomfort.
"Poor kids, they should have been sent to their room. Not thrown out into the cold. It was late, why were they so hungry. Parents withholding food as punishment too.<br>Hope the court orders regular check ups on this family to protect the kids.  Thanks Officers!💔⚖️"
"MAYBE if she had taken her meds when she was supposed to, this incident MIGHT have been avoided (but probably not)."
Allegedly!? Really.  Body cams DO NOT lie. Like it or not.  That&#39;s why they are  worn by the most scrutinized.
"Men you better pay attention, do you think if this was you, you would have had this level of patience? Would you think the video would have edit you being tased?"
"CDC, Peer Support, Trauma Informed Care…nothing is more important to someone entering into recovery than the confiscation of their cell phones. It’s a tragic loss of priorities. Grow up. I’ve seen people beat heroin sooner than their phone addiction."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=358"">5:58</a> Allegedly? My brother in Christ I watched it happen"
I&#39;m guessing the therapy/counseling didn&#39;t work.
"When a suspect refuses to get out of a car, I always wonder why the officers don&#39;t just leave them in there.  If they sit there for a couple of days, they will eventually come out to get water or food, won&#39;t they?  Chocks could be put under the wheels so that the car doesn&#39;t go anywhere.  Voila!  They get out."
She’s 31?!?….Yikes. Looks like a bad 10 mi of broken RR Tracks
"If Kayla &quot;pinned him in&quot; his car by blocking his driver&#39;s side door, I am wondering if he could not have just slid over to the passenger side door to get out. Inquiring minds want to know.<br><br>A note about the cops:  I have noticed that in a lot of these types of videos, officers are swearing quite often - isn&#39;t that considered unprofessional?   If things are getting out of hand, swearing and insulting people is not the way to de-escalate situations.  That seems like common sense to me.  No wonder so many people absolutely loathe the police."
"To my surprise, the young officer who appeared in the video was a police sergeant. At first glimpse, I thought he was a rookie."
&lt;watching video&gt;<br>&quot;Hey everybody...&quot;<br>&lt;Skip ahead&gt;
Why is that cop screaming like that? The lady did it almost run the female officer over that’s all BS. That cop is screaming. Like an unhinged lunatic. He has no business with a taser or a firearm in his hand. Acting like that he supposed to D escalate not escalate Screaming at the top of his lungs. What does that accomplish? I mean the girls should be arrested but I don’t think it helps matters with him yelling at her like that. He definitely needs more training on de-escalation or he needs to find another job because he’s gonna hurt somebody And he’s a liar that woman was nowhere near running someone over.
&quot;You can&#39;t take my son and my dramamine&quot;. GREAT LINE!
"Such a crazy whack job.  Look at the damage the resources to control the nutcase, and the damages $$ all in like 20 mins of chaos.  I feel deeply saddened for emergency services having to risk their lives dealing with this type of risk &amp; attitude, the woman has clearly never been told no."
The entitlement on this lady. Blaming the cops after she rammed both cruisers and wouldn’t listen. 🙄
"Screaming not to let the male near her, you are not allowed to touch me, I don’t feel safe. All the tag lines of victimhood. Next she will claim she has ptsd so she is not responsible. Everyone has ptsd now which angers me because it minimizes the people who truly have PTSD from serious abuse, torture, and war."
Honestly don’t know how these police officers deal with this stuff
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=1264"">21:04</a> that&#39;s some sitcom comedy right there<br>Officer: &quot;...*sighs*.... it&#39;s my car isn&#39;t it?&quot;"
Reminds me of my ex sister-in-law another Ohio resident. Some people just don&#39;t see fair or think they should be responsible for their actions. I would hate to have to deal with her again if I were an officer there. Entitled doesn&#39;t begin to explain this.
I&#39;m confused. Where exactly does this video show what she &quot;allegedly&quot; did before cops came?
Uhhh...does she really think this is going to help her custody case? The entire episode&#39;s been filmed and will surface in any child custody case.
Is that a thing to just not roll your windows down and your magicly don’t have to comply with police’s
Also that other girl screaming bloody murder in the background is making things worse not better. She sounds like a psychopath
Obey law in for cement and you won&#39;t have any problems.
Gaslighting don&#39;t fall for the fake tears The get out of trouble escape clause playing the victim.
"She clearly can&#39;t be allowed to drive, if she thinks it&#39;s acceptable to throw a tantrum using her vehicle as a battering ram. What a clown."
This woman should eventually only have supervised visitations with her young child. Her behavior is dangerous and horrendous.
"Howard Stern show listerners, its Morgan &amp; Morgan! Ronnie, you out there? You on scene? lmao"
"I like how determent the officer acts, avoiding endless discussions. Well done. 👋"
"Definition of &quot;entitled&quot; is really starting to branch out, huh? Usually it means rich people who think laws don&#39;t apply to them. Not mentally unstable people who need a dose of their medication asap"
Is the &quot;allegedly&quot; just for legal reasons or is this ongoing? Bc im pretty sure we saw the whole thing
"She almost makes me reconsider my stance against police brutality. (Also, I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be getting her kid back anytime soon!)"
"&quot;Lady i did nothing, i didn&#39;t run try run into anyone&quot;  yeah lady plenty of proof proving otherwise.  That being said i do hope she gets help in the future because i do think their&#39;s somthing wrong with her."
People are so f&#39;ing spoiled....how crazy 😧😧😧
Playing a victim doesn’t work well when you have child custody!
"She does all that and blames the police. Kayla is a professional victim who’s parents never told her no. “This is what happens every time”.  We have a generation of people who can’t function in society, don’t contribute and never will."
"If she is trying to get custody of her son, I think she just blew it big time. She was acting crazy. Any judge or jury is going to see this video and deny her custody. She is complaining about getting the same treatment as she got last time. What does she really expect? What is the definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and over but expecting a different outcome."
Poor upbringing.
I find it hard to believe she doesn&#39;t have custody of this child. Anyone wanna guess how many kid&#39;s she&#39;s lost custody of. I know for a fact how many. <br><br><br><br>Everyone that slid or fell out.
What country would tolerate this anarchist behaviors.  The police in other countries would have dealt with this very violently. Nobody tolerates this bull.
This is like the 4th video I&#39;ve seen of this woman. I&#39;m pretty sure the situation she was talking about being &quot;tackled&quot; by police before is also on yt somewhere.
This crazy woman shouldn’t have custody of a goldfish let alone a child.
👮- you&#39;re under arrest<br>Karen the 🤡  -no I&#39;m not<br><br> 🤦‍♀️ do they grow people like that?
Listen up he’s informing you to get out of her car.  People are so ignorant today.  Absolutely no respect for the law incredible.
"Umm. I&#39;m pretty sure everything the officers said was a lie. When did she assault one of them, I must have blinked during that one.She didn&#39;t try to run from the police, she didn&#39;t try to run any of them over, and she didn&#39;t actually hit either of the cruisers. Oh yeah, and her sister wasn&#39;t interfering with the investigation, as soon as the officer told her to back up, she did right away. There is nothing the sister did that was illegal, she was a safe distance away from anyone, and never tried to attack, or run up on anyone. The police car that actually did get hit, was the officers fault. she moved her car over so her ex couldn&#39;t leave, and the female officer was standing on the side of the car when the suspect tried to move her car. Then when the male officer shattered her window, she jumped away from the glass and was scarred, all while the car wasn&#39;t put back into park yet. so when he scarred her and she jumped to the other side, she took her foot off the brake, and ended up rolling forward. So it&#39;s kind of his fault. And she didn&#39;t hit his car, he&#39;s just adding that on, to make her look bad, and give her more charges. Probably didn&#39;t help the situation that she was pregnant also."
I’m confused what the initial issue was with all the commotion 😂 What happened last week?
YAY to that officer not taking any BS from I think Kayla? Great Job at getting it done proper!!!!❤❤❤
You know what I&#39;ve learned from these video&#39;s? If you keep insisting your not under arrest the cops get baffled and just let you go.
Sister&#39;s cut from the same cloth. Seems like it runs in the family!
&quot;Allegedly rammed a cruiser&quot;?<br><br>Did the narrator not watch the video?
He can’t take my son she says. Lady he’s not just your son it’s his as well. You don’t own your child. Your child is not property of as a lot of women think.
I like the cop that was no playing. Didn&#39;t talk gor 30 mins he just moved her. Give him a promotion
"Morgan and Morgan are just a clearinghouse for calls. They take your info and send you to a local law firm. I worked with the lawyer they sent me to for 9 months. After that time, they said that the amount of compensation they would get wasn’t enough to continue with the case.  Rip off."
"lol, ask a cop if he/she knows what common sense is...<br>i am sure, they never heard the words &quot;common sense &quot;!"
I’ve been through this with my ex attacking me during custody battle. But back then the courts look at the father as just an atm no rights. The cop just laughed at me when I tried to file a complaint.
&quot;I am not doing anything&quot;. A constant refrain for perps actively resisting arrest. Somebody should turn this into a rap song.
You know the ex husband wished he pulled out years ago…! 😂
They need to learn how to de-escalate. And sometimes it simply by not interacting and talking with the person you&#39;re arresting..
&quot;Entitled woman gets tased&quot;<br><br><b>Law and Crime edits out the footage of the tase</b><br><br>This channel sucks.
Calling the cops abusers when she could have killed someone is a wild accusation.
"Talk about delusional, it just never ends with these people.  What part of reality do you not understand?  🤔"
If this kind of thing happens to you every week then maybe it&#39;s you
She refused to cooperate and then got tased and played the victim. The cop asked her to get out of her car for 5 minutes. He was quite patient with her already.
That dad needs to warn the son&#39;s school about her. Wouldn t put it past her to try a kidnap. How did she know her ex would be there that morning? Is she stalking him?
My daughter’s 15 yo best friend has a therapist to have to deal with having a mother like this.  Do better as a parent!!!
"That&#39;s not &quot;allegedly&quot; we all saw it happen, it&#39;s not like it&#39;s up for debate."
I had to go back bc i thought he said &quot;Unfortunately i havent shot anybod&quot;
Tell sister to obey ..the police manipulator …sister needs to go ..BS
"Oh man, I just wanted to scream at her “Shut the F up!”<br><br>I hope her sister learned her lesson and appreciates she was allowed to leave."
"I am sorry, but the other girl running up to the cops when things got heated and escalated. When she was in the cop car freaking out and the cop said &quot;Did you learn your lesson?&quot; I lost it xD"
What a couple of lovely sisters! Their parents must be so proud.
What mickey mouse department is this. Once the cuffs go on thats it. You don&#39;t let the sister go.
"Too many warnings. The woman was a loose cannon which could result in unknown outcomes. Simple, follow direction or go to jail, full stop."
No woman should be a frontline officer always yelling commands from behind the male officers..
You know what the funny thing is in the end? The innocent guy filing the report probably went and filed the report anyway. :P
She actually thinks that she gets to go to jail with her phone. She thinks she is just entitled and the victim when she faces the consequences of her actions.
I see privilege. Nothing happened to them/her just talked to fussing back and forth even after hitting police car she is still her to see another day with all her entitlement
If she&#39;s currently in therapy and she acts like this.....what is the therapist doing?!
"She is definitely unreasonable and terrifed and dangerous, but the officers need to take some deescalation courses.  Arguing with her is not going to get you anywhere."
Morgan and Morgan literally are the public defenders of lawyers.
The lady cop keeps saying the perp tried to hit her cruiser. So why did she gate to run in the opposite direction to get her car? I didn’t see anywhere to show the sauces was assaulting the Frankie cop. Freaking ridiculous.
I dont think that guy needs to file the police report now.  Its very obvious she&#39;s guilty<br><br>Also i really hope he kid wasnt in the car with her to witness all this.
"Olivia&#39;s bodycam is awesome, getting to see her perspective."
Cant show us the tazer moment and you add an ad right before it...? Dislike.
unfortunately there are too many people that are nuts. And unfortunately cops have to deal with them.
"I&#39;m sure I just watched this woman in another video, where she ran into the back of another vehicle, wasn&#39;t that bad of a crash, but she screamed at the officers &amp; was totally unhinged!"
How&#39;s she having a driving license? Or the car? She&#39;s an accident waiting to happen.
"I understand, that the police broke the window, but why not on the passenger side and why are they using their gun instead of a taeser of pepperspray!?"
"The more I see of those vids from the americans, the more I&#39;m surprised the cops seem to be able to contain themselves lel.<br><br>Some people, oh boi. Our species sucks."
What a mess. My gosh. Like what are you even doing. She better stay single forever. This is scary. I hope my son stays away from these girls
never getting her kid back. and rightfully so.
Shut the door quit talking to her ..make her stand accountable..
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=330"">5:30</a> notice how quickly she opens the door after getting that THANG pointed at her"
"Yep, typical - act badly while simultaneously screaming lies about it the whole time."
Comical how some people would defend this women purely because they dislike cops
"Didn&#39;t the male cop overreact, they are always so quick to get violent.  She seemed to have mental issues and the female was deescalating, then old macho male cop gets violent."
She was acting like a spoiled brat and wouldn&#39;t let go of her cell phone
She belongs in prison. She is a danger to society. She is even harassing the medics.
What a perfect role model  for her son.  The sister obstructed and also should have been arrested.  Funny how the guilty always turn the blame onto the wrong person.  One characteristic of a narcissist.
"She thinks drama and tears, while acting like a threat to police, is gonna matter. This generation is just ridiculous."
These people are nuts..
"My goodness, this women"
Young people have no respect at all and these lawyers are helping this world become so unsafe.  That woman is so wrong how she is acting.  She needs a year on jail.  That is what really needs to be done.
"You are resisting, if she just listened to the cops, there wouldn&#39;t be a problem. Never resist the cops."
"From seeing this incident that she created all on her own, I don’t feel she deserves to have responsibility for a child. She was more concerned about her medicine than the fact that she most definitely won’t get her child back."
"While she&#39;s is crazy and in the wrong, the cops did a terrible job of apprehending her."
Anyone know what Camera&#39;s and Voice Recorder&#39;s that they use?
Do the cops get paid extra for wrangling up cows?🤣
as a Woman in America it is extremely hard to lose custody of ur child. I was curious why the son didn;t want to talk to her as she mentioned in the first few minutes. Now it all makes sense
"&quot;You guys knew what you were doing the whole time!&quot; Yeah, their job 😅"
Lol😮😂 they always turn into toddler&#39;s 😂
She was charged with OVI so she was intoxicated or high on drugs.
REALLY DECENT FOR LETTING THE OTHER LADY GO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES...
Police have got to stop babysitting. Their inaction could have turned this into a very serious matter.
"the female police officer was handling well, then the male officer just completely lost it!"
&quot;This is what happens every time!&quot; Yeah lady I bet! 😂😂😂
"I almost thought the cops had her son at the beginning , “stay away from me” girl they gotta talk to you 😂😂😂 like you have absolutely no say in this matter"
Does anybody know the brand/name of that &quot;headcam&quot;? I&#39;ve never seen one before in use by law enforcement
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=329"">5:29</a> my favorite part cause she wanna play games and I get to see her scared shitless cause of it 🤣"
Not finished with theraphy-dede.
Why do the cops continue to argue with a distressed crazed person? Let her go on and on. Do not participate in ongoing nonsense rebuttals
What a sorry sad person. U won’t get your child back acting like that
The emotional trauma this father has been going thru dealing with a crazy ex wife
I don&#39;t know the law. Is the officer allowed to break her window just because he wanted her to step out of the vehicle?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=174"">2:54</a> non obbediscono perché sono traumatizzati da poliziotti violenti: in tantissimi casi succede questo, mi sembra evidente che da parte dei cittadini non vi sia nessuna fiducia verso la polizia, e considerando le immagini hanno ragione al 💯"
That is one sturdy dress. Not one boob popped out 😂
Cops have a lot of patience cuz I couldn&#39;t deal with that crazy s***
She was so willing to hit people but wants them to baby her.. people have become so entitled and thank they are above the rules and laws.
The way that lady cop was running...how did she pass the exams? lol
"&quot;This always happens to me&quot;<br><br>Well yes, because you always act like a this 🙄🙄🙄"
this is what happens when drugs become more and more common. and schools teach students to fear the police
Its so funny when the cops say “get on your belly” and the belly is big lol
This woman is priceless. She’s either off her meds or taken too many
But I saw on Facebook I don’t have to get out of the car if ordered by police
"First rule: don’t argue with someone who is out of control. Bring her to magistrate, get her in jail."
"“You need to stay away from me” <br><br>Sure ma’am, sorry to disturb you, we are going on our away. You have a great day now ;)"
"Props to that female officer, she was so composed and did everything to de-escalate"
The epitome of chutzpah: She rams cop cars and still plays the victim.
"Another frequent flier, gets situation escalated to a felony charge."
LOL why was she holding her flip flop while getting outta the car 😂😂
Over n over n over. Enough. I hope your as patient with your wife.
Alliance is not a big town. This is half the force I think.
Horrible to hear. TRAUMA TRAINING GET IT -
Colored hair indicates the high probability they will be resisting arrest.
crazy thing is she will prolly get the kid back when she gets out with how the court system is
“its my cruiser isn’t it” bro was in disbelief 😭😭😭😭😭
She just won her husbands case for him. Hope the husband got a recording
I bet she calls herself a &quot;Christian&quot; too! She has no clue she has done anything wrong and never will 😐
Why when they are on the ground handcuffed and the officer says you are under arrest they always say no I&#39;m not.
They listen to bad YouTube lawyer.
This is a disgrace.  We wouldnt handle a woman who is so disturbed like that in the uk .😮
What is wrong with people. They don’t pay cops enough to handle this nonsense.
What a bunch of losers.
You know sad thing is other colors would’ve been shot
Do not let her have unsupervised visits I would think she would be the type to harm her son.
Amazing how long cops let these people throw a fit before taking action.
You just lost all your children in this life and the next. You won&#39;t even be able to say words that start with c anymore
&quot;You&#39;ve delt with me a million times.&quot; Tells us all we need to know.<br><br>Hope little sis learned her lesson. 😔
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=342"">5:42</a> I don&#39;t think getting on her belly is going to help these LEO&#39;S. She&#39;d still be close to eye level with them."
"I feel sorry for the guy, She&#39;s clearly an abuser who then flips it onto her partner."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=310"">5:10</a> bro hit his best Homelander impersonation 😂😂😂"
Those are the consequences for doing your own will.
"You’re under arrest. <br><br>No I’m not. <br><br>Oh. Off you go, then."
"&quot;They busted my face&quot;  No ma&#39;am, it was already like that."
&quot;This happens to me every time..!&quot; Well.... duh.
&quot;Allegedly&quot; ramming? We all saw it...duh!
I call BS
I think this kind of people are lacking in emotional support
just show the full video. we dont need ur explanation and u keep rewinding it jeez!!
So glad the child is hopefully safe from that fruit cake
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=1280"">21:20</a>. <br><br>&quot;its on your bodycam&quot;<br><br>stops mid sentence &quot;yes&quot;"
entitled princess
You&#39;re going to jail....NO I&#39;M NOT !!🤣
after witnessing this does anyone need an explanation as to why the guy was trying to file a police report?
she almost hit OLIVIA. yeah where ??? XD
She doesn’t need to have any custody of her son. Perhaps not even supervised visitation at this point.
What a weak generation.
They cant tase her for refusing to lay on the ground🙄These cops are power hungry
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=136"">2:16</a> the crying strategy is called upon..."
lies to me that female officer were nowhere near being run over. americans like over reacting
"All you had to say was Ohio,  I didn&#39;t need the whole story."
Cant imagine why she would loose her kids....
They need to stop arguing with her tell her her rights and then do your jobs
She&#39;s well qualified for some prison time.
Is it me or did the initial  5 knocks on her window tickle you? 😂😂😂😂😂4
I wonder why the husband left her
"I hope she gets felony charges. At the very least, one year behind bars."
Lol. Telling the cops what to do. She is acting like a child
Why do people make it worse on themselves? All they have  to do is cooperate!
"It is a sign of late thinking on her part, really it is obvious!"
She is reacting to trauma. You are cauausng cause she is trying to save her son
72 hour hold for 5150 evaluation!
What&#39;s with all the tats on the cop?That looks so unprofessional.
I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t let her go when she told them she isn&#39;t under arrest
This is so sad but no way she&#39;s in the right state to be around any person let alone her own son. It&#39;s so sad man.
No wonder her husband don&#39;t want her to have the kid she&#39;s crazy
I swear these resistant and entitled people live for the drama.
"It seems the more rights people get, the worse they behave, what a waste of time having to deal with crap like that"
She aimed her phone&#39;s paralysis beam at the officer to no effect.
Yooo that cop was on 1000 since the beginning he didn&#39;t deescalate at all
well its pretty clear why you don&#39;t have your son
"Folks in Ohio, have went,Kra,Kra!!!;"
she probably tells everyone she meets about this.
Im pretty sure the police DO NOT want too touch her.
She brought all this on herself. She&#39;s no victim here
Someone is actually married to that? Maybe a mom?
Cops are awesome when they are given their rights to enforce
Let’s face it. Cops live for a day like this.
No meds
wonder how the dad (dads do not get custody easily) got the custody
imagine this level of insanity im sorry for the man in this relationship
Allegedly?
This was handled so wrong all of it...small town cops show off.
I&#39;ve never seen an entitled man. Wonder why.
That baby daddy must have been out of his mind drunk!
"That poor officer: &quot;This is MY car, isn&#39;t it?&quot; 😆"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=141"">2:21</a> shes already going for the razzie!"
I think i know why she cant see her kid.
"What kind of medication has she got, that she hasn&#39;t been taking?"
this is what it must be like for zoo keepers to put elephants back in their cages
"She was panicking, i heard the child in the back screaming i need to calm her down. I know she&#39;s in wrong here but wtf man have some humanity"
GROW UP! STOP SCREAMING 😱
Omg is the car ok?
BS
Sister should have been arrested.
Better than Netflex.
Stand there and repeat yourself officer ..please ..making you look weak…please ..freaking manipulate the situation…dictating the situation the women …know what they are doing ..repeating yourself over over over over over over over …finally doing what you said …
i would taken both of them too jail the other one girl will do it again and interfering makes it dangerous for us officer&#39;s
"I am not doing anything, you guys did it again. I need my medacation its not working"
Police brutality the second tase her hands were behind her the police also ignore that she said she was cut
OF COURSE ITS OHIO
"No sé qué habrá hecho esa mujer,pero la profesionalidad y el abuso de la fuerza por parte de la policía,solo delata su falta de recursos profesionales y nunca podrían ejercer en un estado de derecho como Europa."
How did this nice cool guy get tied up with that horse?
"Get away from me, get away from me. Stf with that!!"
Fine police work!!!
He wanted to taze her. But I don&#39;t blame him
why waste all your time on her when other people need help who are mentally stable
"is it me but people with color in there hair seems to be out of it , they need help"
why were the taser sectioned skipped?
Her sister is cute I don’t see how the other one looks like that lol 😆
Drama Queen..
Generations of substance abuse...
The key is don&#39;t resist. But I love it when people try to resist.
You guys there is at least one other video of her causing a ruckus!
The cops are 100 percent right  said  over 10 times get out of car
This can&#39;t be in Ohio - she wasn&#39;t Haitian or even eating a cat.
How many cops n police cars does it take to arrest one women 😮
Maaaan Safelite autoglass is making a killing from these.
👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾
Not one time have you heard them say stop resisting  😂😂
<b>Rams her car into his</b> then acts scared for her life😂😂
"Careful where you put it, fellas. Some of them have teeth."
She seems more scared of the teaser than the firearm 😅
"Didn&#39;t she tell him when he walked away, to keep her away?"
"Best part was &quot;is this a learning experience?&quot; at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=790"">13:10</a>"
Oh drama queen 😂😂😂😂you should not have your son...
What part of open the window did she not understand 🤔
We have raised a bunch of children to be terrible adults.
Cop should just do his damn job and not play mind games.
Not really a surprise they took her kid from her 🙄
Her sister says a lot about that side of the family. Lol
"She did do a lot wrong, but that one cop also went too far."
The most unsatisfying taser video on the internet.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=1266"">21:06</a>  &quot;this is my car isn&#39;t it?&quot; Is so hysterical 😂"
and this is why shes not allowed to have her kids LOL
These last two generations are a serious problem
She said you can’t take my son and my cat from me 😂
the term &quot;entitled&quot; truly is justified here....
this woman is out to lunch
People like this have no respect for authority.
She’s such a poor victim boohoo 😂😂😂😂😂
thats someones mother jfc
Well i guess we know why she doesn&#39;t have her son
She has “interesting reasoning abilities….  😮
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Allegedly? I guess I can&#39;t trust my lying eyes.
And she wants her children!  I think not!!!!
imagine being 31 years old looking like that.
"With women(?) like that, who needs toilet paper?"
WTF happened to Ohio?
Of course it is in Ohio.  Crazy people there.
She&#39;s gonna be calling Morgan and Morgan!
My son is dealing with a psychopath like this. Unfortunately the courts aren&#39;t much help until it too late.
She definitely ain’t getting her son back …
Omg the sound editing made this horrifying
Pink hair. Psycko. Which political party?
He would have been tased me n bust the windows
"I was considering moving back to Ohio from California but maybe not. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=138"">2:18</a>"
Since when are duty weapons yellow? 🤔🤔
The eye of the tiger and the IQ of a peanut
"When the cops call for backup, its a bad sign"
Trash don&#39;t fall far from the trailor park
What happened after her arrest? Any update?
Feeling a lot of contempt for this woman rn
Quick thinking by cop lady to block her in
Those Karen tears didn&#39;t work this time.
Wow crocodile tears for the female officer.
I don’t think that dress is working for her
"Well, that didn&#39;t go as she planned . . ."
Imagine you have to come home to this...
She is a poster child of why drugs are bad🙄
Your son doesnt want to talk to you😂😂😂
These people sometimes
that&#39;s sad she just wanted her kids... 😢
Straight jacket and padded cell......
Is this what participation awards gets us?
i guess now she loses custody for sure now
snowbunnies are so entitled and spoiled
Tell me again...why can&#39;t she see her son?
All she had to do was just get out of the car.
Since police officers are part of family called society. Then we clearly see trend of entitled people on the raise including officers. Try to talk one after his shift he/she will act like entitled ken/karen as well. Problem is we are going high-wire for some reason and it&#39;s unstoppable process :&gt;
Somebody has never been told no before.
cop with the beard is not helping anyone
They will let you go once your charged.
Entitled kids become entitled adults
greasy nightmare as the tpb would say
That man is lucky he got away from her
I&#39;m not buying her story for a second.
I see those fake tears dried right up 😂
this is what happens when you do drugs
😂😂😂😂 SHE did it again.
She should NOT GET HIM BACK
Suspect&#39;s LOOKS are a felony.
This ain’t helping your cause
She is EVERYWHERE! Lock her up!
Pink Hair. explains everything
Do the judges ever see any of this?
One psychopath woman and 64 cops.
“Get on your belly!”<br><br>“Which one?!”
Absolutely unhinged!
&quot;Is this a learning experiance?&quot; 🤣
Right now you guys need a priest
Why dont they show the actual tazing?
You opted to Hold the highlight of the video hostage and interrupt it twice at a climatic point…. I opted to Stop watching. My first time in many years of watching youtube videos that I’ll be researching how to block a (your) channel. Congrats!
I love this no fks given attitude of the cops.<br><br>From where I am there is a female pampering culture.<br><br>A female cop must be present and only a female cop is allowed to arrest a female suspect.<br><br>And in most cases the female plays the gender card and a poor man gets in trouble although being innocent.<br><br>We need this cop system in my country.<br><br>Because we are fed up of this female blshit drama.
Hope the ex got custody of their kid.
People stay in California!
"Oh Karen, you&#39;re so entitled."
Imagine this being your sister..
Allegedly rammed two cruisers
lol &quot;is this a learning experience?&quot;
"La violence ne sert a rien, la police n&#39;a fait qu&#39;aggraver la situation..."
Why don&#39;t people just listen?
The only psycho here is this “mother”.
"Therapist,  that says it all!  🤷‍♂️"
Don&#39;t forget to send her the bill!
She&#39;s got Karen syndrome.
Dang. I feel bad for her son.
She&#39;s some kind of special! 😂
Keep her away from that poor child!
that female officer is Gold
Soo glad I dont live in america.
Make ASYLUMS Great Again!
Man I am so glad I didn’t have kids.
"Hi Dennis, how’s D and Charlie ?"

Omg she&#39;s exasperating 😳
"german polize <br>ask ,once"
Drama so fake its sickening.
Silly moo..not so tuff now😂
Must be some kind of bad drug
That is one sick woman.
I hope she doesn&#39;t have her kids.
The male cops a real one forreal
Take your Meds people!
Why give her so many chances!
That tazer needs new batteries.
Just lower the window!
These cops all so dramatic
how hard is it to cooperate
how did she escape the sow farm
A really sad situation  .
Weird that she’s not haitian
Only in America
The entitlement of some people
Probably should stay away
Ok im done people r crazy
That was so unnecessary 🙄
In short the &quot;Modern Wormn&quot;
The officer ran behind a car backing up thats not on the crasy lady
This girl IS PSYCHO
She is in the wrong 100%
Kings of escalation

The fact that they think they&#39;re being quiet during their pranks when there in the same room.
They need a therapist.

"I wanted to tell you that if you give me an iPhone 11 that my parents have not been able to buy me one, I ask you from Rhodia, please, I beg you"
