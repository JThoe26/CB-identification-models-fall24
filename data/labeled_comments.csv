Colleen  YouTube is a harsh place to put your life on  Ive watched you for years and every day since the start of Covid  I just want you to remember and know you are loved  You are going through a very difficult situation and I know from experience in my life that when something you love and something that defines who you are as a person gets ripped from you because of a mistake or rumors or hateful people it can be so overwhelming and feel so awful that you start to question who you are as a person and what is your purpose for being here  Let me tell you in case you havent heard it from anyone but the people closest to you  you are worthy of forgiveness for your mistakes  You are worthy of love and not just from those closest to you right now  You have touched many people and done so much good  Dont let other peoples agendas and need for gossip define who you are right now  Let them cancel you  You dont exist to make them happy  I feel like from being a part of your life for the past few years that the mistakes made in the past are just that the past  Im still rooting for you and your family and I know Im not the only one,Not Cyberbullying
Your voice is so amazing,Not Cyberbullying

If what she did was sooo terrible then why have charges not been filed against her  Its been what five years since this happened  There has been PLENTY of time to get her in court  That has not happened why  There is nothing here  You think you have all this evidence with screenshots There are two sides to a story  Quit judging her without knowing all the facts  Does she deserve to lose her job over this  If so why didnt that happen 3 to 5 years ago  Why now,Cyberbullying
I love this ,Not Cyberbullying
things will get better  people make mistakes amp sometimes things go over ppls heads  thanks for doing this,Not Cyberbullying
Points for creativity,Not Cyberbullying
this is fucking great lol,Not Cyberbullying
People complaining this is not an apology dude she did it 3 years ago,Cyberbullying
I mean to be fair she did already apologize years ago It just saddens me to see how people are so quick to attack when no one knows the full story or intentions of anyone I just think she has 3 beautiful babies at home that are probably sensing something is wrong with their momma Everyone has a life outside of social media guys Most of us dont even know the half of it,Cyberbullying
You are an amazing person and please dont let these fucking no lifes ruin your life with something they dont know about you are an amazing person and made my childhood Amazing ,Not Cyberbullying

So glad to see you  I have missed your vlogs Praying for you ,Not Cyberbullying
This is tragic on both sides Fans who got hurt and a performer who was monetized on YouTube and sold tickets with all these stage performances recorded and never said anything about it until now and the very thing ppl were entertained by is now evidence against them what does that make ppl who paid to  watch it volunteered to be on stage The whole thing is twisted on every side and sad and even worse forever connected to her name for her kids to see later  Humans are a complicated creature and fame is fickle  u can be entertainment until later its decided its perverse I hope everyone can find healing on both sides eventually,Cyberbullying
Yooooo she got bars tho lets gooooooo,Not Cyberbullying
I havent watched the video yet but she has already spoken about this YEARS ago Somehow it resurfaced Leave the poor lady alone Shes a great mom and is thriving,Cyberbullying

This was genius I love you and I hope your vlogs come back soon ,Not Cyberbullying
Omg Just leave her alone No one needs thousands of people saying the same negative stuff about them No human can handle this amount of hate Let it go and mind your own business She has three innocent children to be a mother to and your words are not helping She didnt commit a crime otherwise she would be convicted of one but you all act like she raped or killed young children Im not a Colleen super fan and Im not invested in this but Im old enough to know that all this hate will just break Colleen and her family will be greatly impacted If you Dont like her unfollow her and take your negativity else where,Cyberbullying
this made me cry,Cyberbullying
LMAOOOO,Not Cyberbullying
her vocals are actually very nice,Not Cyberbullying
Although this might not be the best way to come back and apologize if you actually listen to what shes saying She is saying sorry and she is apologizing And although this is a little strange and I dont fully understand the situation I feel like she went into detail and is actually trying to apologize and tell the truth Yall will just ignore and make jokes and not actually listen to her and then call her out for being a bad person Maybe listen you might actually see that she is trying,Cyberbullying
Colleen youre a real person and this whole thing is such a nonissue for so many of us I wouldnt even address it at this point if I were you Youre beyond all of this You may lose a few followers in the short term Let em go Your talent will give you new ones to replace them So Please stop all this nonsense  its beneath you to participate I cant wait for your next normal video please dont make us wait too long  Saw you in St Albert with my niece and sister We loved it Your show is fantastic,Not Cyberbullying
I miss you I know youre not doing well right now Nobody would be thriving in your shoes What youre going through is difficult AF I feel like you probably arent reading comments anymore because the hate really overpowers everything else right now but I did want to break up some of the hate and judgement with positivity I wonder if this pain is motivating you to be more creative I know thats what happens to me To me you singing with your uke is genuine and very creative  you turned your pain into art I dont like your lyric about you not surviving the crash though you will survive this It wont be easy but you will survive thisbrbrYou are surviving this,Cyberbullying
I was here before everyone else was,Not Cyberbullying
Alright I personally think this was very well said I do think that some specific addressing needs to be done but her message about taking the proof and receipts and adding to them to gain more views and ruin her reputation was LOUD and CLEAR Also why does everything need to be shown on this platform To gain more views its disgusting and unnecessary to have this drama out for the whole world to see,Not Cyberbullying
,Not Cyberbullying
I honestly feel bad because we all know whatever she dose to make up for it it will never be enough for you guys I honestly believe her Shes a human we all make mistakes even if they really really bad She only human after all let her live,Cyberbullying

Well she is undeniably talented,Not Cyberbullying
Oh Colleen s,Not Cyberbullying
I love you Colleen Hang in there ,Not Cyberbullying
You look annoyed angry and frustrated and I enjoyed watching that immensely Good on you girl   I like seeing this side of you,Cyberbullying
Everyone needs to sit down and take a second If she would have sat there and made like a 25min video apologizing you guys would call her a liar say you dont care and say quotshes only responding because she got caughtquot If she never responded you guys would say shes guilty If she completely stuck up for herself you guys would also say shes a liar and say that youve already seen the facts So now she gives you a response not meant as an apology just kind of saying quotdont believe everything you seequot because guess what theres two sides to everything I have been a fan for years and yes what I have seen is really sickening and it makes me really sad but Im not going to bash her before Ive even heard her side This whole cancel culture shit is really fucking annoying I swear people arent even fans of her and are bashing on her Chill tf out,Cyberbullying
Please dont stop your videos,Not Cyberbullying
I liked your song ,Not Cyberbullying

Guess what everyone It wouldnt have mattered how or what she said It wouldnt have mattered if she apologized the way you or anyone else wanted Shes absolutely correct No one is going to care what she has to say They wont believe it anyway So why not do it however she damn well pleases,Not Cyberbullying
Seems like people forget there are two sides to every storybrWhether you have a platform or not NO ONE deserves the amount of hate both sides have received brPeople can heal from trauma privately instead of making it the entire internets business Getting revenge amp trying to tear someones life amp reputation apart from someone who hurt you DOESNT provide long term healing Instant gratification yes But not healing brIf youve suffered from any sort of trauma amp expect everyone to feel for you yet you turn around amp hurt the person who hurt you back you are just as guilty of the person who caused you harm brEveryone is responsible for their own healing brAnd everyone deserves to move on amp gain healingbrLeave Colleen alonebrLeave those affected by Colleens mistakes alonebrStick around for her content or leave if she upsets youbrJust quit spreading hatebrAnd actually have the strength to walk away from what brings you down instead of arming yourselves with pitchforksbrWhether youve made horrible mistakes or not you deserve healingbrAnd you deserve peace brBut no one can give you peacebrThats YOUR responsibility brNot anyone elses,Cyberbullying

this is the most disappointing comment section Ive ever seen lol yall gotta get outta here internet culture is so weird shes responding the only way she knows how singing Singing is her thing Yall wouldve said these things not matter how she resonded,Cyberbullying
I vote this the BEST APOLOGY VIDEO of all time this is a future Youtube CLASSIC in real time brBut im a sucker for musicals and i dont know what the fuck happened or care to find out beyond this video,Not Cyberbullying
Having just heard of her and not looking at all into the allegations she sounds pretty reasonable sure its snarky and a non apology but shes right cancel culture is BS  Defining someone entirely by a mistake they made BUT cancel culture s the reality so you have to deal with it,Cyberbullying
This is great I was never a fan of Colleen but Im so glad Colleen made this video its perfect Well done for calling out the toxicity of all these chronically online bored people,Not Cyberbullying
No one is perfect we all make mistakes You arent evil for making mistakes even really bad mistakes Being 20 25 30 doesnt make you immune to mistakes,Cyberbullying

yall fr needa hop off her back She was just trying to be a good person like grow up and quit spreading bs lies Ive followed colleen for a good 7 years and shes has been nothing but kind So hop off her back and worry about your own damn problems,Cyberbullying
I dont understand why you are receiving backlash for posting this Why people feel this wasnt enough I dont understand why there is so much toxicity and hate Anyone who really knows you would know you would never do the things they accuse you of doing No matter what know there are those who stood by you and will continue to stand with you no matter what Hate will not prevail Thank you for posting this Know that this will only solidify who you are as a person not define you this will strengthen you and lead you forward You got this Colleen We love and support youbra hrefhttpwwwyoutubecomresultssearchquery23stopthehateStopthehatea,Cyberbullying

BRAVA BEAUTIFUL SOUL I am sorry for the torment you are experiencing brbrThere are those who will never truly understand how harmful throwing horrible words like p around and others will suffer due to this brbrMiranda is a character based on humor of the 90s and if people dont understand her thats on them Personally its a genius character and I hope to see you on stage soon brbrThank you for this perfect reply I look forward to seeing you vlog every day again ,Not Cyberbullying
I support you,Not Cyberbullying
Kinda iconic tho,Not Cyberbullying
I think you have addressed this and should just go back to doing your normal content now like nothing happened   Dont read the comments  The people who will watch will watch and eventually the attacks will subside  There is no accountability that would be enough for the people who are angry,Cyberbullying
Awe Colleen This is so sweet Im not sure what the rumors are exactly but keep your head high,Not Cyberbullying

Ok Im done Leave Colleen alone Everyone in entitled to their own opinions I get that Her Miranda character is supposed to make strange commentsTHATS HER JOB Her content is for adults Anyways the rumors are sadif the rumors that are being spread didnt come from her or you dont have concrete proof that she did ANY of thatIm with her I have been watching Colleen for almost 4 years So stop holding her to her past NOBODY IS PERFECT How would you like it if someone were to go and TEAR apart your past Colleen I am so sorry for these rumors that are not even being told as the truth I truly love you and your content Some peoplearent meant for your content I love you ,Not Cyberbullying
I mean song kinda slaps though,Not Cyberbullying
These comments my god Listen to her it would be so easy to just say sorry and let it all blow over but shes sticking to her truth and being strong in the path that she never did anything intentionally to hurt anyone People are so mean and run with anything they hear also that was then and this is now obviously we have ALL grown to know what is right and what is wrong Back then so many things were accepted that arent now but we still drag things up from the past for absolutely no reason These are real people with feelings in a messy situation its none of our business to determine whos right and whos wrong in this they all need to move on and heal,Cyberbullying
HibrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrHi,Not Cyberbullying
Love u and miss u,Not Cyberbullying

It is sad how everything shes worked for her life is crumbling down People make mistakes and it sad that some are publicized,Cyberbullying
Toxic Gossip Train sounds Great   Hope all is great,Not Cyberbullying
I genuinely do not understand why yall are so angry at her Humor in her own way is literally how she handles bad things Have yall learned nothing over the past 15 years of seeing her I dont get it shes very visibly hurt and trying to cope with it Get over yourself,Cyberbullying
Shes made an apology video years ago for all of this stuff Why is it all coming to the forefront again I applaud her for taking another route Sure its cheesy but at least its something different,Not Cyberbullying
,Not Cyberbullying

Just wanted to let you know that the whole internet might be in rage about this song and the whole situation but you are still someone I look up to as a strong af and truly loving momma I followed your vlogs for the past two years while I became a Mom myself Never really commenting but now I felt the need to because everyone deserves love and support as a human being and you might have screwed up in your online past but you do so much in your personal Life for your children and Family and thats worth so much if Not even more You might not be welcomed back in the online community for a while but I wish you only the best and all the love from your close Family and friends and you as a Human being are okay Just the way you are  with all your flaws and mistakes Cause lets Not forget weve all got them Difference is ours are not presented and talked about all around the world best wishes and cuddle the kiddos  M ,Not Cyberbullying
i mean its catchy ig,Not Cyberbullying
Colleen hasnt used her music because she is trying not be disrespectful if you have watched her its how she gets her feelings out through her music Im so sorry people have a past but the only thing different between you and her is you dont film your entire life so people cant point out everything you did wrong,Cyberbullying
Dont get me wrong she kinda ate the song HEAVY on kinda but Im not gonna say nothing bad Im not like that,Not Cyberbullying
Yall arent listening to a word of this and it shows,Not Cyberbullying
I will admit my bias because Ive been watching Colleens YouTube videos for almost 6 years now for context I never really liked Miranda Sings Ive frankly never watched Miranda sings content unless it was for Colleen because I liked Colleen I always loved their familys channels and I watched Rachel Colleen and sometimes Chris The whole Ballinger family thats what I grew up with Only recently had I started watching Colleens Vlogs less consistently Because Ive been busy with college However when all of this came out about Colleen a few years ago I remember believing the person that said it and when Colleen originally addressed it everyone universally came to the understanding that she had made a mistake The irony is all of this drama thats coming back up is it is the same thing that people tried to cancel her with years ago Now by no means am I trying to justify any of her actions but what Im saying is for this video specifically I appreciated the apology I have grown up feeling like Ive known Colleen and known her personality and she always turns to art when she doesnt know how else to express herself thats some thing I quite liked about her because I end up doing the same thing in my personal life The point Im trying to make here is this apology is perfect for her in my opinion because this is an example of who Colleen is and how she deals with problems I think its beautiful frankly when an artist pours their heart into their work I know some are saying that they would prefer for her to have been more professional in this video but contrary to popular belief when all of this came up years ago she did address all of this and made a formal apology years ago So now when people are bringing up the past again and trying to cancel her with the same old thing I think this is a perfect way to respond and I understand if you disagree thats all right I could be wrong and I could be blinded by my own nostalgia but its my opinion Colleen if you happen to see this comment just know that one of your fans has forgiven you and still loves youbrbrbrAlso just bring a little bit more perspective into this I really dont appreciate you guys calling her a pedophile because I am a sexual assault victim I was raped by a 30 year old man when I was six years old he was a pedophile Colleen making a few out of taste jokes and weird comments does not make her a pedophile Please dont label people with such horrific terms when they havent done anything to deserve it,Not Cyberbullying
points for creativity,Not Cyberbullying
why is this kind of a bop,Not Cyberbullying
I love you COLLEEEN stay strong,Not Cyberbullying
Haters back off ,Cyberbullying
What do yall want from this woman She said she made a mistake Honestly though what do yall want her to do,Not Cyberbullying
Colleen I hope youre doing ok Just know you do have people out there who still want the best for you You have made me laugh for years gave me happiness as a depressed tween with no friends helped others in their journeys to stardom are accepting of the loser kids and gay kids and weird theater and art kids outcasted kids poured your heart into your work prioritized your fans over your own health many times youre talented and seemingly a wonderful mother sister daughter and wife The way people have berated you threatened you and body shammed you over this is so vile and toxic If the goal for this was accountability all of those other things didnt have to happen This was a smear campaign I dont argue with there being inappropriate jokes made I dont want to diminish other people feelings about their experiences This whole situation to me has been more about hurting and humiliating you and tearing apart your character with irreversible allegations that arent always presented in a truthful way Calling someones groomer is a very serious and legally punishable thing and implies sexual abuserelationships or other illegal activity with underage people Its not just talking to joking interacting with and being friendly with young people or every celebrity Daily vlogger YouTuber Tiktoker influencer would be considered a groomer The YouTube community was really just beginning in 2012 and most of these YouTubers we know now had ever had experience on the platform or even much with the internetsocial media altogether MySpace was the first real social media and it was very common for larger accounts to communicate with fans of all ages in groups and messages and pen pals with younger people like an olderyounger sister type relationship That was how this generation of YouTubers grew up on the internet Having boundaries with internet followers wasnt something they knew they needed until they blew up enough that they had probably already crossed the boundaries most have in place today How are you supposed to know the limitations as an internet famous person if no one had ever been internet famous before The jokes ColleenMiranda have made are sometimes inappropriate or even bad taste but never with ill intent never with the intention to coerce manipulate or groom,Not Cyberbullying
Honestly preach,Not Cyberbullying
Colleen I know you wouldnt see this but I wanted to spread some love with all this hate your getting I believe you and understand what your saying Your admitting to the things you have done and have admitted you didnt think what you were doing was wrong at the time No body is perfect and everyone is just trying in this world You just wanted people your fans to like you and didnt know the right way to go about it at the time You were young and made mistakes we all do Everyone who attends your shows and watchs your videos need to understand what they are getting themselves into you have always made it clear what they are about and that it is inappropriate and all jokes brbrI just want you to know that I support you  love you and have missed seeing your videos because I think of you as my friend I wish you all the best and hope you can still see the positive messages you are getting through the hate ,Not Cyberbullying
kinda a jam tho,Not Cyberbullying
Fire song ngl,Cyberbullying
So your telling me she has been online for 15 years and all the sudden these things start coming up I mean ok believe what you want,Not Cyberbullying
Yall cant be mad that she didnt apologize when youd just make fun of her for that too I dont think you REALIZE how much things like this can ruin a persons life in almost every aspect Ive been a fan of Colleens for almost 10 years and have even met her Shes genuinely the sweetest human I have ever met She agreed that what she did in the past was weird and you have to keep in mind that she was very young herself when she started Miranda Sings She has grown so much and learned so much as we all do Please think about how this is affecting her and her mental health She has said all that she feels she wanted to or could to defend herself its not right to make fun of her for defending herself Shes not just some youtuber that everyone wants off the internet Shes a wife and mother Think not only about her but her family,Not Cyberbullying
I mean Tbh I dont know much about the situation but everything she says here seems extremely genuine Thats just my take on it It seems like everyone is just shitting on her for just doing this in music form when in reality its much mote genuine than 90 of any Youtubers apologyexplanation video,Not Cyberbullying
Look yall need to calm down ,Not Cyberbullying
Not me in my head playing that office gif of Michael screaming omg its happening everybody calm down CALM TF DOWN  But you have no idea how EXCITED I AM TO SEE AND HEAR YOUR VOICE QUEEN Its like that feeling when your friend has been grounded for 3 weeks and then they finally get to come back out and hang out with you again Everything in your song is what your army has been saying all along We love ya weird auntie bff cousin sister all the things you are to us  Also the ending literally made me throw my head back and cackle laugh ILYSM ,Not Cyberbullying
Guys YN she is a comedian its her job to make videos like this and try r thing with her sending stuff to fans shes a comedian and like tf is she supposed to do idc what the internet is were all humans and if she did do bad stuff its in the future everyone makes mistakes and although people make bigger ones Its sad to think of people who see her that way bc I still love Colleen,Not Cyberbullying
Im kinda half and half on if Colleen allegations are real but one thing I do want to say is why didnt she post this video on her main channel this channel has been like her safe place and she just introduced it to almost all of her haters and doesnt she want more people to like know her opinion on this matter,Not Cyberbullying
thank you so much you are so brave,Not Cyberbullying
hello,Not Cyberbullying
Wow,Not Cyberbullying
I will saybrbrWe dont know whats happening behind closed doors We dont know how things played out All we can do is trust our instincts that there are trustworthy people out there,Not Cyberbullying
Its sad that some people feel they need to put others down in order to get ahead You are a kind and generous person Coleen I enjoy watching your videos and seeing your beautiful family Wishing you love and strength during this difficult time,Not Cyberbullying
There have been some terrible comments on your video but just know your fans love you,Not Cyberbullying
Honestly best response ever,Not Cyberbullying

You obviously care a lot,Not Cyberbullying
Yayyy Shes back,Not Cyberbullying
Ive been watching colleen and stopped but still sometimes watched her videos but if you people actually watched colleen and Miranda yall would know colleen anit like that cause now the Genz is so sensitive and snowflakes because 1 person did a mistake and all these things were back then in the 2010s and the humor and status were different then like people could take jokes and the thing with Adam if u watched the stream he SPECIFICALLY asked for the panties because she was unboxing random things and was giving it away and with the girl who was quotexposedquot on stage she wanted to get called up for the corn challenge but got called up for yoga and she couldve denied it and didnt go up but she did so its basically her fault for going on stage knowing her outfit was revealing and with the kid and cheeseballs he couldve said he didnt but that was all an innocent act u can hear the parents and children laughing in the crowd so all this is absolutely bogus because when something comes out and you realize colleen was right and innocent yall gonna look real dumb and if those people were victims Im sorry but everyone should not be jumping on colleen like this cause yall loved her and now all of sudden hate her make it make sense because if you were a fan youd defend her and not accuse her so what is this like all these people are so invested in someone elses life and making a big deal out of it and now that technology is advanced theres things that can be fake and generated so yall shouldnt be riding colleen like its the toxic gossip train so yall really need to calm down with all this she made an apology and you guys are upset about it this is wildddd,Not Cyberbullying
YES COLLEEN I LOVE YOU FOR THIS I LITERALLY LOVE YOU SO MUCH MAN,Not Cyberbullying

Colleen Im so sorry this is happening to youyou are a beautiful wifeincredible mother and these are the things l seebless you,Not Cyberbullying
I completely unrelated to what was going on remembered watching Miranda sings and your personal blogs back around 2015 and I remembered how much your content made my loser days a little bit better dealing with the hell hole that was public middle school Thank you for sharing your life and thoughts online it made me feel less alone then and it does now We carry on with our heads up ,Cyberbullying
Everyone is just picking this apart without actually listening and thinking about what was said Which kind of is her whole point with the video People want to pick apart every little thing and not actually put things in perspective She did admit her mistakes and feels awful about it But people only want to see the bad and cant look through one side of things,Cyberbullying
everyones making fun of her for quotsinging an apologyquot but honestly if you just read the lyrics as it is it makes lotsa sensebrbrall i can say is who am i to judge ,Not Cyberbullying
Colleen it will pass you just have to wait,Not Cyberbullying
I miss you You are a positive vibe,Not Cyberbullying
I love the song,Not Cyberbullying
I love that this is her response People are blowing this out of proportion Enough with cancel culture She apologized years ago get the fuck over it brThere are real criminals out there and you are canceling a woman who apologized for this in the past supports kids with cancer every year on her birthday makes lighthearted videos about her sweet family Give me a break Yall need therapy,Not Cyberbullying
Im trying to understand this timeline of eventsbrThree years ago she was accused of inappropriate contact with underage fans One in particular came out and made a video She took accountability and apologized for her inappropriate choices and has grown and changed since then brMeanwhile the person who made a video was doxed bullied and harassedbrNow more corroborating evidence about her inappropriate contact has come to light and people want her to apologize again I dont understand that She has already apologized If anything its the people who bullied that one person who came out with the allegations that should apologize brbrI think that maybe singing this wasnt the best move but she is a human and people are emotional and flawed and thats kinda ok I dont know what glowing saint person you want to see on here but I always felt like she was honest about her missteps and mistakes and took strides to learn from thembrbrIm 40 and it would kill me if people still judged me based on who I was 15 years ago Anyways Thats my two cents,Cyberbullying
I am so sorry Colleen you are going through this It must be really hard You are a mom a wife a sister a daughter a niece etc At the end of the day we all mean well Theres so much stuff and I really hope one day you vlog I have always enjoyed seeing your videos and vlog about your life,Not Cyberbullying
Haha the Internet is so cool,Not Cyberbullying
what shes saying low key makes sense yall dont want her to apologize you want her off the internet for good and probably wouldnt be happy unless she was put in jail any apology she could make wouldnt satisfy people Glancing at you penguinz0 ,Cyberbullying
You guys dont understand she took accountability in private Which explains why the fans that called her out with screenshots powerpoint presentations video clips written accounts with a timeline  never referenced this accountability Because it was in privatebrbrI bet you all feel silly Not silly enough to go against your managing team that apparently told Colleen to not respond at all wonder why that is And certainly not silly enough to pick up a uke and construct a song that seems more practiced than an apology directly to the people who brought this to light to begin withbrbrI bet you all feel very silly,Not Cyberbullying
You are a star  and you shine  as bright as day,Not Cyberbullying
colleen i have been watching you for 10 years and i have not been on social media for the past 5 years other than youtube because i just realized that life can be lived without it i have seen a lot of what has been said on youtube and to me  i completely understand that you did not recognize in the moment that you were crossing boundaries because you really do make your viewers feel like we are your friend and that is what we love you for i can also see that you recognize now that it was doing harm to some and you want to make it right just regardless of what is happening on the internet remember that in the end you are a great person and have an amazing family who love and support you and your kids have an amazing mom that they are looking up to love you girl ,Not Cyberbullying
This just looks like a mental breakdown to me imagine having millions of people express their opinion on you on a daily basis its going to get to you which it clearly has her,Not Cyberbullying
Even if all the gossip were true youre still not a bad person and deserve some basic respect I feel so bad for all of the unwarranted distain aimed your way Hang in there I hope you have some support around you you will always have me as a fan at least,Not Cyberbullying
I pray you are not in agony right now because we all know how hard you take things and how much you overthink There are still people out here who love you Colleen Im praying for you and your family Everything will come out in the wash Stay strong and please eat something ,Not Cyberbullying
and dont forget nothing is all white or all black and this is true for everybody,Not Cyberbullying
  ,Not Cyberbullying
obsessed,Cyberbullying
WE LOVE YOU ,Not Cyberbullying
Hope Youre okay ,Not Cyberbullying
Yes Get MAD More people love you than hate you  F the trolls,Cyberbullying
She is completely true people have made rumours about stuff she has done Yes she has made mistakes but that was in her past we all have made mistakes in our past Being mean and saying things that are not nice will not fix anything She has children now she would never do anything like that stop making up lies If you believe those lies and dont like what she did Then leave She is trying to make videos doing what she currently loves we know her intention she is simply trying to make us happy Showing us her lives her kids growing up giggling laughing singing living her life Just because she is famous does not mean people should be angry at her If you havent made a mistake on your life then there must be something wrong with you And if you made a mistake years ago how would you feel to have millions of people going after you saying mean things making up lies Be real people think how you would feel and start being real Now if you dont like Colleen anymore leave That is fine with her I am sure probably better Go,Cyberbullying
This is genuinely a good song tho,Not Cyberbullying

You guys are all so fucking brutal She made MANY mistakes She was inappropriate but I believe in my heart she didnt try to groom children Like its a stretch Shes unwell clearly and yall wanna see her suffer until shes gone for good So fucked up this cancel culture How did James Charles survive but Coleen got lit right up,Cyberbullying
i have never in my life expected colleen to ever be attacked and harassed like this or canceled ever ever ever everyone is making fun of her for making a song out of the situation but if you actually knew her shes a singer she sings for EVERYTHING thats who she is shes always made songs for everything her actual genuine supporters know this im not trying to account for her mistakes but she is addressing it in the way she felt most comfortable idk i have been supporting her for more than 10 years and still love her shes a good person with a huge heart who has made mistakes but so has the rest of the world,Not Cyberbullying
COLLEEN I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUU FUCK THESE PEOPLE YOU CANT SAY IT SO I WILL FUCK EM KEEP DOING YOU AND MAKING PEOPLE LIKE ME SMILE AND HAPPY  I lOVE YOU SO MUCH,Not Cyberbullying
I have been around since the Josh era I have essentially grown up WITH uim 36 I do know theres a huge difference from what we SEE on youtube vs quotreal lifequot But i have watched u go thru so much We have been pregnant together Cried together U have cried far more than i have lol but when Flynn was born i balled my eyes out When u posted ur pregnancy announcements and ur old house tour after u bought ur new home i cried with u Most recently the death of ur chickens U cant FAKE being a good person We all make really shitty mistakes When i first heard about this drama i started watching one of those videos and i stopped almost immediately I just wanted to know what was happening I simply didnt believe and i still dont that u harmed anyone intentionally I hope u make it thru cuz u are one of the only people i still watch faithfully and it breaks my heart Mostly cuz i feel like i know u and i know how much this is hurting u I can only imagine the anxiety and stress this is causing Ur poor fingers must be worn raw Chin up friend ,Cyberbullying

Cancel culture sucks Everyone makes dumb mistakes in their lives Unfortunately for people well known it ends up being smeared everywhere Yes she made a few silly mistakes but it was very clear she was never quotgroomingquot Adam and didnt have any sexual interest in him whatsoever The only people that can throw a dagger in Colleens direction are those who have never made a stupid mistake before and Im sorry to burst your bubble but thats no one,Not Cyberbullying
I LOVE YOU,Not Cyberbullying
Y is this kinda good,Not Cyberbullying
Colleen sending you and your family so much love The internet has really shown what a nasty place it can be here recently brI know you are a kind compassionate woman and mama I hope your family and friends are wrapping you in love and support in this timebrWere all human and it seems so many people have forgotten that I hope to see you in this space in some capacity in the future but if not Im wishing you the best,Not Cyberbullying

colleen just keep on keeping on in spite of the storm float above the noise embrace the turbulence,Cyberbullying
Love you Colleen So sorry you are going through this,Not Cyberbullying
I mean we all gotta calm down She chose to expose herself but no one is perfect I really think shes changed people change and try to be better We should all try and be better than yesterday seriously who are we to judge people by their past,Not Cyberbullying

yall clearly didnt watch this video through and are just paying attention to the singing part listen to the words shes genuinely sorry,Not Cyberbullying
I support you Colleen people do make mistakes,Not Cyberbullying
Lets be honest no matter what she said or did in this video she was going to get ripped apart for it anyway All everyone wants to do is cancel her anyway without realizing people change,Not Cyberbullying

Colleen just hang in there people do make mistakes ,Cyberbullying
Colleen you are an absolutely amazing human being period and I adore you for this Im so glad you spoke out about this stupid toxicity on the internet,Not Cyberbullying
Guys she sang the song because it looks like she couldnt get the words out otherwise Shes clearly distraught and doesnt deserve this Nobody is perfect but were not on show for the world,Not Cyberbullying
For what its worth I do not think youre malicious,Not Cyberbullying
No one is perfect All of the allegations are from 10 years ago Move on and mind your own business   I dont think she owes everyone on the internet an apology The only apology owed is to the ones that what has happened proteins to So for the love of all that is good get off her back and find someone worse to attack,Not Cyberbullying
lol everyone in this comment section is mad because she called you out for having nothing better to do with your lives than dig up stuff people did YEARS ago and hold it against them,Cyberbullying
i love u colleen,Not Cyberbullying
I have been so worried about you I may get attacked for this but I believe you didnt have any bad intentions and we are all human and I dont think you deserve all this I may get attacked but idc i still love you,Not Cyberbullying
what she did was not ok but maybe the only way she can apologize is through music so instead of being mad at the apologized through a ukulele be grateful that she apologize at all,Not Cyberbullying
Love you so much and always will,Not Cyberbullying
Absolutely brilliant ,Not Cyberbullying
Bro yall thought all the shit she was doing years ago was funny but now everyones upset bc we live in a social media world of cancel culture yall are wack ,Cyberbullying
I love you Colleen The internet is a scary place and I cant imagine having it has my job I have missed seeing you and the kids Stay strong,Not Cyberbullying
I love you colleen I dont care about what people are saying you are amazing and keep your head up high gurl ,Not Cyberbullying
Yall are really just looking for someone on the internet to be upset with go get involved in your local communities and get mad at the peoplepoliticians who are actually hurting humanity No one should be this distraught by an internet personality who in the grand scheme of life isnt really a monster,Cyberbullying
No apology would be good enough for them Good for you for not putting up with this All of these allegations were already dealt with 3 years ago and you apologized People need to move on People make mistakes people change and youre real fans will be here when you get back,Not Cyberbullying
This is amazing I love you Colleen ,Not Cyberbullying
YESSSS,Not Cyberbullying
The fuck me right at the end hurt bc Colleen you are my childhood and ilysm so dont give up ,Cyberbullying
I LOVE YOU FOR THIS,Not Cyberbullying
Look I understand that there have been more than small mistakes made in the past and that Colleen should take a little more accountability for that However as she said people make mistakes at the end of the day and I dont think it is on the public to constantly scrutinise her about itbrbrIf you dont like it simply dont watch brbrHer actions with fans in the past went over the line however that doesnt mean that she is a terrible mother I have watched her vlogs since she got pregnant with the twins and didnt have any doubt about her love and devotion for them Sure they are displayed in videos but what person online doesnt do that Its not only her and its something to look back at for memoriesbrbrAgain I say if you dislike it dont watch it I will never understand how people think that it is ok to harass others She is well aware of her mistakes and leaving harassing comments wont change that,Cyberbullying
Well this was iconic Everyone wanted her to speak and there you go I like her,Not Cyberbullying
Good for you for talking and defending yiurselfbrLove you so much PERIOD,Not Cyberbullying
I love you so much and i will always support you you help me through so much,Not Cyberbullying
were all human I still love you,Not Cyberbullying
I LOVE THIS IM SORRY COLEEEN,Not Cyberbullying
honestly the most real response to drama iv ever seen always here for you for colleen ,Not Cyberbullying
At the very beginning of collens yt career she has been sharing with us how introvert shyloner  little girl or even up to now she is This yt thing and popularity is not even her intention why she is making yt videos up until now So if we come and think of it she is not used to having a lot of attention from anyone We should all be understanding and give everyone a chance to grow from their mistakes Our generation is far different from theirs it is nice to see that young people are making a change but we should not shame anyone for making something wrong especially if its the past and that person is trying to have a life and change for the better,Not Cyberbullying
I love you although the singing wasnt the right way to approach it Im on your side,Not Cyberbullying
I keep singing this song in my head i love it,Not Cyberbullying
You need to read THESE comments and not the HATERS commentsbrThey are just making videos for views and clout,Not Cyberbullying
im reading comments and some of you definitely came here to just hate she said her team do not want her to speak about it they never said she cant sing it she obviously wants to say her part but her team is stopping it which is why she turned it into a song im not justifying what she has done or what others in this situation have done but you all seem to pick and choose what you want to hear,Cyberbullying
Awww hugs ,Not Cyberbullying
I missed u Colleen stay strong,Not Cyberbullying
Brave and Strong,Not Cyberbullying

IVE MISSED YOU SO MUCH,Cyberbullying
Colleen did take accountability for what happened in the past and explaining the show is PG13 Apparently everyone is tone deaf because she is explaining everything she has done was wrong and how she fucked up Im not making a excuses for her because honestly she is a great person but shit everyone does wrong especially really hurting people Nobody is perfect She is not manipulating no one,Cyberbullying
I still luv you Colleen,Not Cyberbullying
Look around you Colleen there is more support for you than you think Supporters arent as loud as the jealous zealots Look after yourself and your family first ,Not Cyberbullying

This slaps,Not Cyberbullying
People suck its ok Keep your head up,Cyberbullying
Sending so much love ,Not Cyberbullying
She has some good points but she is a mom so I do think she is going through it Im so sorry Colleen hopefully you take time for your mental health and you have been on the internet for so many years so a break is good for you And I hope you do reach out to the people that felt abused in this situation The internet is a scary place but hope everyone gets there peace ,Not Cyberbullying
Is nobody realizing all this stuff that she did was in the past EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES,Cyberbullying
I love you Colleen I miss you videos I watched every single one since before Flynn was born I hope you come back,Not Cyberbullying
hi,Not Cyberbullying
even if she would cried and fell to the floor and said sorry a million times yall would of still said  shes gaslighting us she is still a horrible person and she every possible thing to keep on just HATING shes changed and either way little kids shouldnt be in her shows since u can clearly tell her character is for older audiences NOT 78 yrs olds so if the parents take them to her show they shouldnt get mad since everything she does is part of her ACT,Cyberbullying
Omg she made some mistakes in her past I bet everyone who is calling her namea never made mistakes to and havent taken accountability for it Think as if this is happening to you wont be funny if it did Leave her alone,Cyberbullying
I dont know the entire story with what kind of messages she sent to fans But what I do know is it was forever ago Theres way worse wellknown people still out there Idk why this apology is hated when she could have listen to her team and not acknowledged anything but she felt as if she needed to Shes come so far from where she started she helps more then shes quothurtquot since then Like she said people say things and everyone feels like they want to be part of something by hating her Your not just hurting her but the family shes grown and the loved ones that have to see her in distress Its really sad and Im not trying to validate anything that she has done But Im sure u guys have forgiven friends and family thats done more then just text people trying to be funny in an inappropriate way Sorry ur going through this love I hope u come out on the other side and u have the strength to carry on despite The internet is a cruel maze of funhouse mirrors Its hard to navigate when everything so distorted But its easy to follow somebody elses lead when they think they know whats real Just carry on and youll find ur way out of this mess You still have fans,Not Cyberbullying
Colleen you dont need to apologize Anyone that thinks youve done something horrible I can bet if we looked through that persons phone they too could have something taken out of context I would think people would be very careful with accusations now say as we know a lawsuit will punish those that are lying Im so sorry Colleen ,Cyberbullying
She still ate,Not Cyberbullying
,Not Cyberbullying
colleen the ones who know know I love you,Not Cyberbullying

Hi Colleen and who ever else will read this brI am so glad you made this video and I think you need it to I have always been a silent fan I rarely comment but I watch every single one of your videos not exaggerating I started watching what other people were saying about you and I began to question if it was true but then I would see some wild things For example one creator made a video about you and he had never even watched you assuming you are a family vlogger when you have said explicitly you are not Videos of your past of you saying not so kind things have resurfaced What irritates me is people refuse to see your growth and the fact that you are an advocate for so many people You are a best friend to strangers on the Internet who need you when they have nobody else youre a mom who reminds other moms that they are strong too you have have mental health issues and advocate for the fans you love to accept their mental health issues as well and everybody who watches you knows theyre not alone What people fail to realize is that your fan following is not a cult we are people who have made mistakes too and admire your willingness to grow as a person and learn new things about life that you once didnt know You teach others to open their minds just as you have learned to Please never quit posting Please keep being the inspiration you are  please keep being the amazing mother you are please keep being the fun kind creative person you are,Not Cyberbullying

yall are so annoying shes a person too anything can be screenshotted and take out of context she could have handled the situation better but she is right she has changed her ways and she is openly admitting that it wasnt appropriate to say to her fans if this was a man everyone would be over this within a day yall are so bored with your own lives that you involve yourselves in someone elses,Cyberbullying
Im so sorry this is happening to you right now  Please take care of yourself  Things will get better Your babies need you to be happy healthy and strong Unfortunately the internet sucks and people jump on the hate train Just remember that you have a ton of amazing people in your life that love you and know the real you Just focus on the beauty in your life and let the negativity wash away Sending positive vibes to you and yours,Not Cyberbullying

I love colleen I grew up watching her I dont think she is a groomer or predator She has always been my favorite person I like that she has made this into a song I get bored watching people apologize for 30 minutes and not mean a thing She has turned this accountability and song into something else that will take the pain away for her and makes it a little light hearted She has talked to her fans but a lot of tubers call their fans their best friends and Colleen actually made initiative to talk to them I see where she is coming from with that Colleen is just the aunt that is trying to be there for the kids so they have someone safe to talk to I love and support Colleen always have and always will,Not Cyberbullying

I Hounestly wish people could really see what shes saying like shes gone a strange way about it but it draws attention to a valid point  if everyone was world famous on the internet for most their life there would be things from everyones past that could be dug up to cancel them  people are so quick to be vile on the Internet and it adds up  all hate and facism is wrong but poorly made jokes in a time where no one called people out for these things dosnt mean these celebritys need to kill themselves to equal justice,Cyberbullying
Spot on Cancel culture is so dumb just a bunch of people getting high on hating together brbrI truly enjoy your content as one of the last youtubers that still dares to share as much as you do And as an awkward person myself its so sad and scary how people gang up and prescribe intent behind other peoples actions and defense seems futile brbrI hope that hate wont win this time,Cyberbullying

As a long time viewer of Colleen music is therapy to her and shes made a bunch of reading mean comments video on her channel and I think thats the idea and vibe she went for It backfired because people judged her based on this one video instead of analysing knowing her behaviour for years as a subscriber and a narcissistic boy on the internet who gets way less views on his personal content lol brAnyway we have all made mistakes in life as humans they may not be as public as celebrities go through Forgive dont forget and continue living life The sooner you get out of your bubble of life should be fair it isnt so move onbrGlad youre back Colleen ,Not Cyberbullying

I enjoyed the song and it is built to the brim with truths about our society A lot of people from my experience likes to formulate a thought based on information they learned without grabbing the concept that all information received isnt 100 revealed As time progresses incremental information will be discovered if the individual is vigilant and ready to absorb the information they are oblivious of noticing from their previous experience Most people like myself prefer not to wait and would rather be noticed now versus being noticed some time in the future People who put contemplative thought with the content they create eg books movies etc release their media weeks months and maybe a year before they release their content for public viewing yet people without the experience of being patient and will reply based on their current life situation and hopefully learn from their actions if it is a mistake Their are two common phrases Im feeling is relatable with my perception trying to gain fame andor notoriety clout quotplayers going to playquot and quotany publicity is good publicityquot,Not Cyberbullying
People these days are never happy and find a problem with everything she has a good point and everything she said is valid,Cyberbullying

I just recently learned about this ad and I gotta say that I can kind of see why people think the way that they do If anything the marketing team was just too politicized and incompetentbrbrLook I can see that the goal was to target sexual minorities to sell expand the customer base but the large part of the customer base was probably ticked off by the focus being on someones celebration of their transition and this advertisement being in a halfassed way linked to march madness Some people also say that this person Dylan is her name has an audience which includes a decent amount of minors It is highly inappropriate to do advertising via her channel in that casebrbrSo whether right or wrong a company has a customer base and ideally they should respect that customer base Some people disliked the advertisement Alright so stop taking that advertisement route and do it in a more honest and less provocative manner next time after a long while Apologize and do advertisement strategies that appeal to everyone or most peoplebrbrAnd this is the issue if bud lights marketing team was honest about doing their work they would do the above and actually submit to their customer base looking to continue to increase their companys sales A wrong thing to do would be to proceed to say that your customers are out of touch Thats not marketing Thats politicization and a bitter aggression against the majority of your consumer base for not being politically brainwashed into accepting anything that is progayismbrbrThere is nothing wrong with gay people However there is something wrong about expecting everyone to feel the same way about gay people being promoted as gay people and leaving the beer as a secondary promotion while the collaboration should be secondary to the productbrbrSome people will like the ad some people will dislike the ad and some people dont care either way Its disgusting to expect everyone to think the same way It just doesnt make sense and it would be biased to say anything else other than AnheuserBuschs marketing team is bad at marketing and political maniacsbrbrBy the way I would say this if it went the other way but theres usually a progressive skew to these advertisement regressions Companies should respect their customers or crumble They exist only because the people work hard most of the time and spend their money on said products Customers are venerable And companies can only have a little bit of that venerability if they acknowledge that,Cyberbullying

I dont hate anybody but if Bud Light was going to legitimately support LGBTQ Id like to think that they could have done a hell of a lot better than this I mean all BS aside look at the presentation This looks like its marketed directly towards elementary school students Associating alcohol and sexuality with children is not okay I can vividly recall the Bud Light commercials from the 90s when I was a kid and it showed a frog with its tongue out sticking to the back of the beer truck We all laughed at it Since then theyve had pretty mainstream and lame commercials That didnt really matter at the end of the day because they had neat merchandise bowling pin shaped bottles and a decent product Now those old neon signs and clocks are going for dirt cheap This just wasnt a very good commercial from any perspective,Not Cyberbullying

Getting over the obvious cringe this commercial is i think one of the more unspoken cringier things is him acting like a lot of girls dont know what March madness is at the beginning,Cyberbullying
Seriously why do people always talk shit but never talk about they feel It doesnt feel like the wokeness is the problem It feels like people are using their trans status as excuse to bully them instead of just telling them that the way the ad is presented just comes off ignorant Seriously why is bullying and the norm instead of proper feedback,Cyberbullying
With all the talk about this I really though they were going full woke with rainbow cans and transgender discounts or something I dont get it this isnt even close to what netflix and countless others are doing While I couldnt be further from ever sideing with lgbt stuff I see no issue in whomever to drink shit beer and even promote it,Cyberbullying
I dont get why people are so mad about this Yea its obviously a company that has too much money to give a fuck about what gender someone is but you see that with all companies now so I dont think bud light should get any hate for it,Cyberbullying
When the boycott began i asked anyone to give me their Bud light cans they dont want anymore since then i have not spent a penny on buying BL and have even sold quite a few six packs to people who dont give a fuck about this dude sponsorship all they care for is the beer and i recovered quite some money from the beer I bought before this boycott and i still have lots of BL stocked,Not Cyberbullying
Putting aside anything about trans people the ad is just bad I thought that it might at least be something creative or at least not look like a video some random shot on their iPhone They couldnt do better,Cyberbullying
Im just curious about what this Bud Light boycott is more over The fact they asked a transgender person to do well what i would not call an ad or the fact they put Dylan Mulvaneys image on 1 can which is a souvernier can for Mulvaney alone,Not Cyberbullying
ahhh the old quotim a woman i know nothing about sports tee heequot its insulting brFor a community that doesnt like stereotyping and labeling they certainly do a lot of it,Cyberbullying

Part of the distaste for this ad is it basically mocks the sports industry Bud Light is successful because of sports fans and this person doesnt care about sports at all  go team What sport is March Madness  Know your audience  99 are sports fans and this persons ignorance of sports being featured on a national campaign is going to torpedo the product,Cyberbullying
Ridiculous the outrage from this simple video lmao People need to get a life There are more important things to lose your shit over than this,Cyberbullying

Eef Hoos Ik heb alles verkankerdbrbrBud Light Hou mijn bier en wokewaanzin vast,Not Cyberbullying
hard one to understand this move from Bud why would the brand do this I get that you might want to diversify your brand I get that you want to move away from beer guzzling frat boys and redneck image at the BBQ no not stating beer drinkers are always this just making a point relax  But youre then going to target the audience that is in the VAST minority in the world but for some reason heavily catered to brNot only are you targeting a negligible audience when it comes to possible sales  but at the same time that new audience and the spokesperson that you decide to use arent quotsupportedquot or accepted by a significant portion of your current consumers how else did Bud expect this to go down  nonbeer drinkers arent all of a sudden going to start drinking beer  but your current consumers will certainly stop drinking your brand when you change the quotimagequot of that brand from ordering a bud light to have a beer now ordering a bud light is a political woke statement that noone wants to take part of when ordering a beer  same as how the Ford Raptor now quickly became the car to quotrepresentquot trans simply because Ford put a rainbow on it  Ford Raptor owners clearly the most woke people out there why would you mess that image up,Not Cyberbullying
Just now seeing this The thing that gets me is the can design Its really poorly done I think they were maybe trying to rattle peoples cage with this at least part of their base demographic only why would you do that Its a really bad design,Cyberbullying
Soon there will be no more bud light or any bud because of this insulting video There should be a statement about who was responsible for this and the person they sponsored like Mulvaney could care less about saying about this meltdown,Not Cyberbullying
Why is everyone blaming him for the troubles the company ran into because of this commercial He did the job he was hired to do The company didnt get taken down because of DylanThey got taken down because of their own decisions to make this commercial and not test it with a control group and air it,Cyberbullying
 So we have a multibillion dollar product and need an ad to consolidate our position in the market any suggestions br Yup I was thinking we could employ one of the most controversial personalities in America who knows nothing about sport has a really awkward fake smile and ask them to record something on a mobile phone It will be dirt cheap and save us a packet by not using an advertising agencybr Excellent idea get that done will you,Not Cyberbullying
Even if he was a genius nobody could see that nobody can see anything about his personality because he keeps making his sexual identity his whole identity Hes cultivating that himself Thats why nobody recognizes anything else about him except for one single thing which is that hes transgender If thats what he wants to be recognized for thats what he got Stop complaining,Cyberbullying
It really isnt that offensive Sure shes not that likeable but I cant see anything offensive about it at all Who gives a shit what other people do with themselves anyway Im less concerned about her and more concerned about the amount of people who seem to be obsessively concerned about the sexuality of somebody else I expect some backlash for this post but I dont drink the kind of beer bigots drink  and I drink with people who arent preoccupied with thinking transexuals all day ,Cyberbullying

This is not how a grown adult apologizes  What are you sorry for Who are you saying sorry to What behaviors are referring to This is performative insincere and just as vague as any other apology shes ever offered anyone,Cyberbullying
Its horrifying how easy it is for terrible people to absolve themselves by wrapping their wrongdoings in a pseudochristian cover,Cyberbullying

Thank you Gabbie im happy to see you in a better place now lt3,Not Cyberbullying
Until you personally and privately reach out to RO and apologize this will ring pretty hollow Repentance is followed by a change in behavior and by continuing to insist that you have nothing to say to RO you are showing that you are the same exact person as you were fourfive years ago And Im saying this as a Christian like an actual Biblereading follower of Christ As your sister in Christ I would really advise you to reach out to RO in a compassionate and humble way,Not Cyberbullying

Yeah no I dont like this at all There were some good apologies to some people but jeez the people you really went after did not get the care and time they deserved with this The pivot to religion makes me uncomfortable and its weird to bring that in when are apologizing to people you self admittedly traumatized The apologies to your fans is good and probably will help them and obviously Joey accepted your apology but the amount of energy you put into tearing some of those people down is exponentially larger than the effort and time you put into the apology brbrIn general this feels weird Like why are you apologizing to your family on YouTube Do we need to hear it too I understand the fans and maybe some former coworkers but it was weirdly personal and impersonal at the same time Admitting youre wrong is hard and I understand its probably easiest to put it all out at once but Im just a little confused about the goal of this video as a whole Is it for the people youre apologizing to or for you,Cyberbullying
Tell me why you ranted ONCE AGAIN about RO in your oxford interview after you apparently reformed yourself Shes one of the people you owe an apology to the most but youll never let yourself make one to her because you have just as little self awareness as you did before ypur long break Youre the same as you used to be but just wants us to THINK youve genuienly changed,Not Cyberbullying
quotsorry to anybody I hurtquot is such a worthless blanket apology Then again Im sure this wasnt posted to be genuine it was a desperate attempt to get her abysmal view rate back up and I guess it worked because I watched it,Cyberbullying
A very rough watch You are apologizing to everyone Everyone but the people who you fell out of favor with That pride and ego are definitely still rockin My partner and I used to like some of your music and we were looking forward to the come back but this made it 100 worse for the few who liked you and wanted to see a change,Not Cyberbullying

Takes a very shall we say interesting mind to interpret James 516 as quotRecord a video apologizing to nobody in particular in the most generic of terms humanly possible while also adding snide sorry you feel that ways for good measurequot Nor do I think it meant absolving yourself of all responsibility simply by claiming you quotforgive everyonequot and with mealymouthed halfhearted quotsorryquots into the voidbrbrAnyway as always Gabbie Hanna makes a video about her favourite and only topic herself  Later on in the video she says she used to be selfcentered vain and prideful making meaningless content  which is exactly what this is  Working quotlike a robot work pay attention to me get moneyquot  this is exactly what is still going onbrbrIf deliberate andor outward lack of selfawareness was a religion Gabbied be one of the patron saints,Cyberbullying
Rachel deserves an entire apology video to herself The absolute VITRIOL you showed toward her was abhorrent You were cruel on a deeply personal level She was objective and honest Its clear who was in the wrong there There is treatment for narcissism Gabbie and being a narcissist doesnt have to make you a bad person but it will if you dont actively work on it and you allow it to make you project all of your own faults and wrongdoings onto everyone else,Cyberbullying
This is such a none apology Apologise to Rachel Oats properly,Cyberbullying
Gabbie God is way more forgiving and accepting than you can even fathom The God you speak of sounds judgmental and condescending and sounds less like a vision of the Lord and more like a reflection of yourselfbrbryour faith will always be lacking bc you project so much of yourself on a pedestal to worship instead of truly listening to His words and teachings of compassion and selfless care brbrstep outside yourself and become a member of Christ that He can be proud of,Not Cyberbullying
I worry that Gabbie believes she has found herself when in reality she has lost herself Not sure if its some kind of trauma response or what But all the overly religious content and intense worship of god and jesus feels forced and makes me uncomfortable The prayer at the end was a lot Ive lost myself in religion as a young adult so I get it I really am rooting for her Ive been a viewer for a decade and hope she can find herself and that shes truly happy ,Not Cyberbullying
Who else was here and watched the WHOLE damn video waiting to see if she would ever be a truly better person and apologize to JS directly Sad that this was such a waste of words and 0 accountability,Cyberbullying
Using Gods name in vain is when someone calls themselves a Christian but does not live like Christ The people who go to church every Sunday and call themselves good people and boast about being devout Christians but show through their actions that they actually arent good people are the kinds of people who live their life in vain of God They would use Christianity for their own personal gain materialistically and socially instead of personally or spiritually They forget that religion and spirituality is a deeply personal journey and not a social or status symbol A person who lives their life in the way of Christ does not judge or impose their beliefs onto others yes Jesus traveled and spread his message but he did not force anyone to believe in him and his words and he did not judge them for their beliefs or circumstances is selfless and kind has respect and love for all living beings speaks the truth not harshly but in a kind gentle way and without fear when youre the only one who speaks up is patient slow to anger and forgiving and has humility being able to put others before yourself and recognizing that youre no more important than the person beside you brbrWe dont need to see an apology video we need to see a change in your behavior,Not Cyberbullying

She knows that turning to religion will shield her from responsibility Its great that you are apologizing and I do think that should be recognized but the apology did not go into detail  Its not a full apology Yet since you are turning to God now you have all of these religious NPCs who will praise you and dismiss your horrible past just because you mention God It doesnt come across as genuine Im sure there is some real remorse and reflection there But you have a LONG way to go I hope you take more steps to make things right instead of absolving your sins with religious bs,Not Cyberbullying

Honey I can forgive your past mistakes but I personally take offense at the way you choose to correlate a lack of religious practice or just the fact that not everyone is a Christian with tragediesbrThe reason why tragedies like the holocaust 911 and 107 happened and so on all happened because of fascists Its not an act of god but the men who committed these atrocities have done what they did in the name of godbrAnd when Christians are actually suffering and facing persecution whose fault is it if not of their tormentors who are inflicting harm on christians because theyre christiansbrGabbie I love you very much Despite all that you regret and despite all i disagree with you on youre still someone I will always look up tobrWhich is why I think youre taking it too far and your faith just seems like fanaticism at this point Religion is not everything no matter how much you believe in it,Cyberbullying
See I love the growth but the constant quotGod here Jesus thatquot and saying that quotI was an NPC before Jesusquot Im a fully functioning human being without any faith and Im very glad that you Gabbie found faith and love that you needed in your life But please also respect that there is a lot of people that arent religious I loved seeing the transformation youve been going through but IN THE WAY things were said it feels like a Jab and really disrespectful towards people that dont believe in the same thing brbrI guess this is where I will take my leave Ive loved supporting you and I know youre going to do fantastic things but I dont feel like getting disrespected or feeling like someone makes me feel less than I am,Not Cyberbullying

I mean this with all kindness Im happy youre growing and acknowledging the hurt youve caused but I really hope you take a moment of stillness to ask yourself why you made this video I do hope that youve actually apologized to these people one on one Additionally if you are genuinely dealing with guilt the best apology is changed behavior and the very first step towards changed behavior is owning your fuck ups without any shame attached to them because youve forgiven yourself brbrAnd I know this following statement may sound harsh but I think you should step away from the internet and make your spiritualgrowth journey more personal than public Because as people have stated this seems a little icky,Not Cyberbullying

This is genuinely the most preformative apology I have ever seen You have put on the clothes of Christianity of the love of Christ but you do not display His love or His compasion You are a pharisee I hope you heal but I hope everyone you ever hurt heals first brquotDepart from me for I never knew youquot,Not Cyberbullying
RO,Not Cyberbullying
also quotget my lick backquot means you got your revenge essentially lol I understand that you meant you learned your lesson lol,Not Cyberbullying
Ummm Two quick little things At a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv8svKhRBAkqYampt7201200a asking for apologies from others when you are apologising is not the time or place Secondly its hard for a video to seem sincere when its got midroll advertsbrBut Keep growing and getting better if Jesus is showing you the way keep following his example and his spirit We all stumble but he forgives us far more times than we ever forgive others,Not Cyberbullying
Is this satire,Not Cyberbullying
I also want to say that if the whole entire internet had the same opinion that you were in the wrong and that YOU were being absive and toxic towards RO and JS that should be a clear sign that were right There will rarely ever be a situation where the whole entire MAJORITY out of thousands and thousands of people have the same opinion on a situation and be wrong We all said you were in the wrong in how you treated those women because you objectively were Get rid of your insanely high ego and just apologize Tell them youre sorry Directly,Cyberbullying
offering up your forgiveness during an apology vid like you expect apologies are owed to you is WILD,Not Cyberbullying
I wonder how many dislikes this video has,Cyberbullying
You have not changed at all  still as toxic as ever,Not Cyberbullying
This video is givingggggbrFill in the blank ,Not Cyberbullying
sorry as a youtube apology literally means nothing your apparent growth should be shown through actions your actions show you to not be sorry and incredibly self serving amen,Cyberbullying
Yeah pro tip laughing obnoxiously after every quotapologyquot really doesnt sell it in any way as something genuine and meaningful it completely cheapens it and makes it meaningless You still speak and carry yourself like a highschooler a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv8svKhRBAkqYampt347547aa hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv8svKhRBAkqYampt356556a holy shit this is so dismissive and what an insulting and underhanded attempt at an apology If you actually had any real integrity and guts youd be ashamed by thisbrbrThis entire video is quotI treated you like shit I used you gossiped about you didnt compensate you emotionally abused and took advantage of you and only cared about myselfand Im sorry that you seem upset about thatquot There is not a single ounce of sincere remorse for doing any of these things all you did was halfheartedly throw around vague platitudes,Cyberbullying
If you were sorry and had learned anything you wouldnt be shaming women for what they wear and calling Rachel Oates dumb and uncreative in a very recent interview While I understand mental health struggles and I hope nothing but the best for you in your healing I very much stand with the women you harmed,Cyberbullying
When someone gets their quotlick backquot that means they got their revenge against someone who wronged them It does not mean they got a taste of their medicine or learned their lesson iNot being a jerk but I would want someone to tell me if I were unintentionally saying Id gotten my revenge against multiple people Im trying to apologize toi,Cyberbullying

I want to support you but unfortunately a lot of hateful Christians has made me skeptical of religious people Do you love and accept LGBTQ people Do you believe being gaybeing in a gay relationship is a sin Do you believe in a womans right to choose I just need to know to fully support and be happy about this and Im sorry about that Many people have a hate the sin love the sinner mentality and Im not sure thats fully accepting either Ugh I just want more public examples of progressive accepting loving Christians,Not Cyberbullying

The god stuff is getting kinda tired it would be nice if you did a video without mentioning religion,Not Cyberbullying
This is great on the surface but she clearly has not changed if youve seen her new TikToks shes completely flip flopping between this new narrative shes trying to portray and between the old Gabbi with very wrong and messed up views on how the world works in her screwy little head Its a very lazy attempt of trying to convince people of who she is when really she has not changed and thats very evident with that questionable Oxford interview You can see how bitter she STILL IS over getting negative criticism over her book  Bro get over it not everything that comes out of your mouth is pure gold,Cyberbullying
Is this an apology or you sidestepping accountability,Not Cyberbullying

Gabbie I really wanted to support you Especially after the release of Where did I go  its such a strong song and I was so excited to see your growth But to make this tone death apology video when the other day you were called R achel Oat es a talentless loser is so unbelievably out of touch Gabbie its time to let the past go You did bad things but you can move on Focus on your art leave everyone alone But the work into your art like your poetry but make it good Not Instagram Rupi Kaur trash You can do well you prove it with your lyrics Lets get something out we can all be proud of,Cyberbullying

I can say from experience  letting go like this whether you are apologizing or accepting apologies brings so much peace to your soul What a great place for you to be at in your journey ,Not Cyberbullying

Matthew 524 first be reconciled with your brother then offer your gift at the altar Rachel Oates pointed out that you did not reach out to apologize so what you are doing with this apology completely contradicts what you believe in As a Christian you should probably listen to what Jesus says If you are claiming to be a Christian act like one and actually try to apologize to the people youve hurt,Not Cyberbullying

Hi Gabby I just wanted to let you know that get your lick back is actually from African American Vernacular English AAVE and refers to getting ones revenge I am not sure this is what you mean in this context as it seems that you are referring to karma coming back onto you,Cyberbullying
Hi Gabbie I would like to say I completely understand that youre embarrassed by some of your music I would also like to remind you it was a time in your life that ultimately put you on the path youre on It also means something to your listeners including myself brFor those reasons I dont think you should delete music ,Not Cyberbullying

Gabs Ive been here for a while now and I love how much you have grown  On the topic of you saying you werent the best role model I just want to say even though you may not believe it you have actually raised me through the years I am who I am because of you You literally made me a better person through the years Fr  Ive looked up to you since I was 13 And Im 20 in 15dayswhich sounds crazy tbh I love you  Youre doing great I hope youre having a wonderful dayweek ,Not Cyberbullying

I LOVE YOU GABBIE I WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT YOU,Not Cyberbullying
Look is this a better apology than a hell of a lot of other YouTuber apologies Absolutely yes But coming from someone who isnt religious it feels insincere If you have gone through a spiritual journey and have had a turn in faith good for you If that journey taught you that you have a lot of apologies to give great The problem comes in mentioning that you realized you need to apologize BECAUSE you turned to Christ rather than apologizing because you wronged peoplebrbrThe thing that a lot of people who are religious dont understand is that we dont subscribe to any of the same beliefs If Jesus has forgiven you thats fine But just like my last point saying that makes it feel insincere It makes it seem like that you dont actually care if WE forgive you because Jesus did so we dont matter Whether or not you want it to come across that way mentioning religion so heavily in an apology makes it really easy for it to come across as insincere selfactualizing and non personal,Not Cyberbullying

It would be great if you name people because obviously a lot of sorry have to definitely have names in mind  But i guess this is he best well get i do have to say there is now some self awareness but i feel like the next phase hopefully isnt the born again Jesus psychosis phase if Jesus saved you great love it but dont try to make that your whole new personality your more then that,Not Cyberbullying

Ive read a few comments here saying this wasnt genuine because it wasnt more specific and initially I agreed but when I thought about it I understand why you didnt name names Those people probably wouldnt have wanted that especially if theyre still upset over certain situations I do have two small criticisms though Regardless of your beliefs bursting into song in the middle of an apology video probably wasnt the best choice The last person to use their musical talents in an apology video is still being side eyed for it You probably should have edited out the giggles too You were heading in the right direction You just veered off course As for the rest of it it could have been worse,Cyberbullying

Nice growth Gab,Not Cyberbullying
Oh wow I got here fasttttt,Not Cyberbullying
This is so inspiring ,Not Cyberbullying
You look so much happier and Im happy for you ,Not Cyberbullying
This is a little much it seems ur just apologizing for being a teenager ,Cyberbullying
Im gonna say a few things as I watch brbrFirst off I like that you took notes and in my own opinion and viewpoint took the time to really think about who you owned apologies tobrbrI like that you didnt name names showing that you respect peoples right to privacy and anonymity Watchers of your channel arent entitled to know who exactly your apologies are for brbrI dont know if you have apologized in private I can only hope that you did Its not for me to judge brbrI will say that i can tell this is rehearsed so to some it feels inauthentic but again youve obviously put thought and care into these apologies and some people expect some tearful emotional apology when real life isnt always like that sometimes as humans we get smacked in the face with our bad behavior and have to realize how we messed up  the important thing is to grow and move on brbrIm glad that you have found Jesus and are in your own time making these apologies and we as watchers of your content are allowed to go on this journey with you we arent entitled to any of this but you Gabbie chose to sharebrbrAnd for that I thank you God bless,Not Cyberbullying
,Not Cyberbullying
I never liked you or your content but as a fellow Christian I believe you and can see that there is a change happening To everyone judging this girl just because someone becomes a Christian doesnt mean that they will suddenly do everything perfectly Yes she hasnt apologized to anyone directly but shes acknowledging that she has done wrong to people Past Gabbie would never say such a thing Change takes time I think the fact that shes aware of her past wrongs and that she needs help is progress in itself If you dont believe that Jesus can change people just watch He will prove you wrong Jesus loves you Gabbie and forgives you As long as you continue on this path He will change you from the inside out,Not Cyberbullying
Just seems like she got a new therapist,Not Cyberbullying

Omg could we see Gabbie on the JustTrish pod ,Not Cyberbullying

In a lot of this youre apologizing for being human I dont want to take away the importance of holding yourself accountable in life but I dont think its fair of anyone to expect humans not to post about their human day to day experiences Whether that involved someone else or not Perhaps you can choose to post more thoughtfully and  or choose your words more delicately but humans are allowed to speak on experiences that impacted them,Not Cyberbullying

Okay this is not a comment for Gabbie This is for people who wanna talk theology If believing in religion doesnt make you a good person thats great Youre soul is grown amp youre capable of self trust Im happy for you  Getting to this level means you should understand empathy kindness and compassion There is no reason to hate Godbelievers Christ lovers are trying to find meaning outside capitalism which a great step towards building a world we can live amp love Hate is for them to channel at sindevil Love is ours to spread,Not Cyberbullying

hi gabbie ive been a youtube watcher since 2015 and watched you on and off since the beginning of your channel brcan i pop in and give my point of view of the whole thing if thats not too muchbrwhile i  and im sure EVERYONE  appreciates SO MUCH the thought put into accepting the past mistakes and owning up to it and putting it out there wouldnt it be much more appreciated by everyone involved if u directly attached names to the apologies bru cannot apologize to someone that is faceless and nameless everyone will wonder is it for me and no one will truly FEEL the apology 100 brwhile i feel u may not want to throw names out there for everyone involved im sure everyone involved wouldnt mind your fans WILL wonder because im sure some names youll apologize to arent a public feud like others and chit chat but you can just let them wonder away for why youre apologizing to some of these people brthat would be my suggestion brim sure my comment will get lost in the sea of comments but if it doesnt do a new video titled a long overdue apology revised and im sure everyone will be much happier ,Not Cyberbullying
Wow Seems like people dont understand forgiveness like at ALL I think this was a great and important thing to do Gabbie  May Jesus be glorified,Not Cyberbullying
Gabbie youre more beautiful than ever inside and out,Not Cyberbullying
its wild it took religious fanaticism for gabbie to finally apologize im glad she feels healed but her version of religion reminds me of the one that gave me and my friends and family religious trauma,Not Cyberbullying

You all are way too negative Shes growing In the video she mentions being anonymous on stories but still feeling awful about it Why the hell would she flaunt everyones names publicly Even doing this is vulnerable Youre upset bc shes trying to be light hearted and uplifting about the whole situation Just bc shes not groveling and begging for forgiveness does not mean shes not sincere Its a message to everyone she hurt thats shes sorry and shes a changed person to hopefully allow conversation in the future With all your negativity you should be taking the time to find the thing that allows you to want to apologize and feel more uplifting Hers just happens to be jesus brbrGabbie i see you i see that youre trying As someone with a personality disorder seeing someone that has those characteristics trying to not diagnose but had been worried about it for years now i know its hard but Im happy for you that you found your peace,Cyberbullying

Being homosexuality is sin 1 Corinthians 6920brNew International Versionbr9 Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God Do not be deceived Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with mena 10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God 11 And that is what some of you were But you were washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God Repent turn to Jesus he will forgive you god bless you all god love you,Not Cyberbullying
Encountering God in the Bible is one of the most fulfilling parts of the Christian life Learning how God loved and led the people of Israel in the Old Testament helps us to understand salvation historybrMeeting Jesus in the Gospels and experiencing his love mercy and compassion is often at the heart of a persons faith And reading the Letters of St Paul and others in the early church encourages consoles and inspiresbrThe Bible is the treasured friend of billions of believersbrBut for many LGBTQ Christians the Bible can feel like the enemy In the Book of Leviticus homosexuality is called an abomination a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9m13e3Uydjwampt11021822a a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9m13e3Uydjwampt12132013a And although Jesus never explicitly condemns homosexuality thought he could have he is hard on divorce for example St Paul does 1 Cor 6910 The few biblical verses that address homosexuality are used against LGBTQ people over and over in the political sphere by religious leaders on social media in oneonone encounters and perhaps worst of all in homilies and sermons in the very churches where LGBTQ people seek to encounter a loving GodbrBy the same token the Bible proscribes many laws moral codes and ethical guidelines that modernday Christians ignore dont follow or have rejected completely For example even though they honor the Old Testament Christians dont stone people who work on the Sabbath Ex 352 We dont sell people into slavery Ex 217 And if someone curses God we dont execute them Lev a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9m13e3Uydjwampt14502410a16 In the New Testament St Paul told slaves to be obedient to their masters Eph a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv9m13e3Uydjwampt385625a29 He also said that women should be silent in churches 1 Cor 1434 A nowfamous online response to the verses against homosexuality points out even more biblical practices that any thoughtful person would reject today Besides Catholics are neither literalists nor fundamentalistsbrSo one response to what are often called clobber verses because people use them to clobber LGBTQ people is to see them in their historical context and remember that even devout Christians shouldnt do everything that Old Testament commands Likewise for the Epistles in the New TestamentbrThe questions though remain How can we best understand what the Bible says on homosexuality What did these passages mean then and what do they mean todaybrAnd for LGBTQ Christians perhaps the most important question How can we square these verses with Jesus who reached out to those on the margins How can LGBTQ people their friends families and allies read these Bible verses,Not Cyberbullying

What is love baby dont hurt me In all seriousness though love is patient love is kind it does not envy and it does not boast True love is respecting people being selfless and having no hatred or jealousy towards them The ultimate example of love is when God himself put his spirit into his own creation and lived a humble life He couldve chosen to come here and make himself known to the whole world but no he loves us to the point where he puts our wants and needs ahead of his own this is why God gave us free will the ability to do whatever we want because he will never force us to do something we dont want to do He suffered an extremely painful death the death me and you were supposed to suffer for our sins And on the third day he was resurrected and will now live forever My friends this love is the love which Jesus was referring to when he told us to love everyone He was not talking about the human definition of love an intense feeling of deep affection he was talking about the love he himself showed us My friends if you love Jesus copy the entirety of this comment and spread it to those who need to see this May the Holy Spirit guide you my friends,Not Cyberbullying

Please dont interrupt meafter shes already asked the question and repeating it And she insists on showing her ignorance and rudeness instead of walking away after embarrassing herself about the link between the black crime rate and abortion,Cyberbullying
People do not listen to understand They hear to respond,Not Cyberbullying
I like how her entitlement allows her to cut him off when she was pretending to have a civil two sided conversation to firmly say Please dont interrupt me and then proceed to repeat the exact same sentence she has already said several times Refusing to advance the conversation forward and just repeat until he submits This is how these people think Also according to studies how schizophrenics think As they also like repeating patterns of thought,Not Cyberbullying
The girl in the Malcom X shirt is the brightest one in the bunch and seems to be open to real conversation  Kudos to her,Not Cyberbullying
Charlie is EXACTLY correct on affirmative action  I have been passed over for promotions and job positions in MANY instances because Im WHITE  Idiots going to college havent even entered the quotworkingquot word and have ZERO experience on the matter  Try passing testing for CHP Sheriffs Dept and being on jobs with  longer employment time and qualifications and getting passed over for someone less qualified just because they are of their quotcolorquot   The best qualified for the job regardless of skin color or ethnicity should be the standard otherwise you have safety problems and rogue authority like police that should never be police  Being 62 I have experienced it A LOT,Not Cyberbullying

I admire Charlie for putting up with the stupidity he faces with these indoctrinated kids  Bravo Charlie,Cyberbullying
The young black lady actually gave me the impression that she might even be willing to have a thoughtful and truthful discussion about the nuances of historic racial issues if not for the other exhaustingly immature and misinformed young people around her Maybe just a couple more years on her would help but good for her Good for you young lady At least youre thinking about this stuff critically and even asking questions still,Not Cyberbullying

I love when they ask a question and then immediately follow up with quotDont interrupt mequot when the person tries to answer it,Not Cyberbullying
Everyone rapid firing at Charlie and he takes it with openness and willingness to engage and have an actual conversation Its too bad that once these assholes are proven wrong then they try to talk over him and when he takes a second to pause and collect his thoughts when asked a question they immediately try to discredit him and tell him he doesnt know what hes talking about This ladies and gentlemen is what bigotry truly looks like That is a double standard I can spew whatever bullshit I want without any sources or facts and thats okay But you have to answer our questions immediately without gathering your thoughts or youre lying Look at all the people surrounding him and look at the smug or hateful looks on their faces They arent there to be taught or have an open discussion theyre there so that they can defend their fragile egos and misguided information on political topics Ive never seen so many closeminded people attacking someone for stating facts They want to jump down his throat without having any evidence or sources to backup their outlandish claims Im glad Charlie stands his ground and carries himself with such respect and believes in what hes trying to do Educate America,Cyberbullying

What charlie said about affirmative action lowering standards is so true Were seeing it in action today There is a situation in a state where black social workers were not passing the social worker test so theyre talking about doing away with the test so that more black people can become social workers That means that any standards that  you used to have to meet are no longer in place Its honestly the worst thing that could happen to our country I dont care if youre white and black brown if you cant pass the preliminary test then you dont get in It means you dont meet the qualifications or standard set,Cyberbullying
i cant help but cry a little inside when people say quotmy truthquot or quotyour truthquot those people clearly have never learned what the word truth means  very obvious these college kids havent done any homework,Not Cyberbullying

What they dont know is that every person creates their own truth based on their belief system Someones truth can be that smoking cigarettes is healthy if their belief system supports that idea and another persons truth can be that smoking cigarettes is deadly Both can be right and both can experience a confirmation of their truth because their belief system is strong enough to support it no matter how different is for others So debating about whose truth is more truthful is NONSENSE because truth is subjective and can override collective truths For example if most of the people experience a certain situation in a certain way this is how science creates studies and theories there can be someone or even a few people who dont experience the same results of the same situation simply because they have a very different belief rooted in their subconscious that dont allow the collective truth to be brbrWe create our truth and its made out of our beliefs and our beliefs are made out of our experiences brbrThese guys are wasting their time There is NOOO universal truth brbrHumans can fly humans can be invisible humans can grow limbs The only reason we havent seen any of these is because no human has managed to make any of these things part of their belief system but we will see it eventually,Not Cyberbullying

I think my one gripe with Jubilee is that when they bring one side in to chat they dont tell that one side to leave to give the other side their respect to chat their points I think they should give each side their respected times and then after they make their points both sides could come together and debate on points which would help to keep the topic on track without distractions,Not Cyberbullying
Its super disingenuous to say that you dont know what a candidates policies are They are easily accessible to the public If you dont see them Its because you dont want to see them so you can keep going back to your talking points that the policies dont even exist,Not Cyberbullying
I enjoy the concept of these videos but it seems like the quotwinnerquot of the argument is the person who is better at debating Lots of tactics to catch the other person slipping often talking over the other asking classic strawman arguments etc It seems like the focus of the debate devolves into who can win the debate not who has the stronger pointsbrbrWould love to see the 1 conservative in this video debate the 1 liberal in the other video,Not Cyberbullying

I take it most of the people who commented in the past have never seen or heard the original musical CATS by Andrew Lloyd Webber Most of you have been overly judgmental to those who like it who cares if they like something diff than you World would be a boring place if we all liked the same thing Anyway I also take it you missed the core of the story which is basically being accepting of others for their appearance and differences in general  seriously not sure how I missed that this came out in movie form though I may not watch it as I prefer it on stage The art form and dance is beautiful though,Not Cyberbullying

"Foreign Gangs Take Root in Americas Sanctuary Cities America can no longer ignore the consequences of its failed experiment with sanctuary cities and unchecked illegal immigration The problem has metastasized beyond our southern border and now threatens communities throughout the nation
br
brThe latest outrage is happening because of the loudandproud sanctuary city of Denver Colorado where foreign gangs have found sanctuary alongside the illegal immigrants Mayor Michael Johnston the thirdworst sanctuary mayor in America has championed an effort to fund myriad programs for illegal aliens at the expense of police public parks and Department of Motor Vehicles budgets among other legitimate concerns of citizens As a result nearly 40000 aliens have arrived in the Mile High City since December 2022
br
brDenver is not the only sanctuary city where Tren de Aragua has set up operations In New York City the gang has masterminded a crime ring that steals New Yorkers smart phones uses the financial data on them to plunder victims bank accounts and then sells the phones in South America The gang has also used the citys migrant hotels as places to extort money from residents and to recruit new members
br
brIn sanctuary Chicago a 911 call has gone viral detailing a Tren de Aragua takeover of an apartment building by 32 gang members that sounds almost identical to the incident in Aurora In response a video posted on X by a Chicago resident suggested that further takeover attempts by Tren de Aragua would be met with violence by homegrown gangs So in addition to all the other bad consequences of sanctuary policies cities like Chicago should now brace for shootouts in the streets between American and foreign gangs Is this part of how immigration makes us stronger as sanctuary mayors have told us ad nauseam",Cyberbullying

"SELLING LIES HATE ASSASSINATIONS FOR PROFIT BY MSNBC AND CNN
brExperts agree that the near assassination of Former President Donald Trump by troubled and mentally disturbed teenager was caused by the constant irrational attacks on Trump especially constantly referring to him as Hitler To an irrational mind like the shooter there is a moral justification to shooting Hitler since Hitler killed 12 million human beings including the gassing of 6 million Jews The Democratic Convention proved that the Democrats have no policy or position to solving any of the huge problems threatening the survival of todays America and Americas Middle class and lower class The only platform they are running on is hating Donald Trump and mentioned his name over 300 times on just the first night again calling him Hitler and a threat to American democracy MSNBC is not about Journalism but is a leftist organization that  leads the nation in promoting lies and hate speech and simply parroting  the daily scripts given to them by the Democrats and the deep state MSNBC is owned by NBCUniversal whose CEO is a person named Michael Cavanagh NBCUniversal is owned by Comcast whose CEO is Brian L Roberts The question is why Cavanagh and Roberts allow MSNBC to continue spewing this hate and divisiveness that twice almost killed Donald Trump Trump is a compassionate man with a loving wife and wonderful children and grandchildren whose lives would be severely impacted by his death The answer could possibly be that Roberts and Cavanagh put money and profits ahead of morality and are selling lies and hate for profit How can they live with themselves Is this the example they are proud to show to their families and friends Is there any decency left in corporate America Do they send their children to schools that  put Tampons in boys bathrooms as signed into law by the  democratic nominee for Vice President who makes fun of people like JD Vance who went to Yale University a condemnation of Yale graduates which is repeated frequently on MSNBC Is Yale university happy with this Does Cavanaghs and Roberts salary and stock options if any derived from MSNBCs constant lies and hate speech that almost resulted in the death of Donald Trump  These are questions that should be answered regarding the management of MSNBC and Comcast In my case I would advise parents not to send their children or contribute to Yale University not to watch MSNBC or NBC and do business with any company owned by Comcast MSNBC and CNN are failing as Americans wake up to their lies Cavanaugh and Roberts should be brought before congress to testify under oath why MSNBC is ignoring traditional and investigating journalism and just parroting daily talking points given to them by the democratic party and the deep state in order to create havoc divisiveness and attempted assassinations Shame on them",Cyberbullying

Cong Emmer thinks that Trump should stick to Issues  There are three reasons he doesnt  br1  He doesnt actually know anything about the issues except those that might pertain to him personally like tax cuts for the rich  Otherwise he wouldnt talk about anything but very targeted tariffs not slapping them on all importsbr2  Hes too lazy to care or find out about the issues so when he came up with the idea of what to do when he is miffed about the leader of another country everything is personal to Trump hes just looking for a simple way to punish that leader  You can bet there will be exemptions for imports from Hungary and Turkey for examplebr3  Since Emmer is helping Vance prepare for the debate and Buttigieg is helping Walz how about the two of them have a debate too  Emmer and every Republican knows that they cannot win on the issues  When you leave out the racism and authoritarianism Republicans know that they are onetrick ponies and that flawed as they might be Democratic programs and proposals are popular and theirs arent ie Republicans since 1932 have almost never been able to win in Congress on the issues  When Republicans did win on trickledown economics how many voters actually believed that rich people would use the windfall they received from Republican tax cuts to benefit workers as much as themselves and how many voted Republican just to change to anything else from DemocratsbrbrThese are the reasons Trump makes completely vague statements about the issues using the adjectives of a sixyear old  igreat terrible wonderful fantastic awful horriblei  instead of giving the voters details  So according to him crime will disappear if we just allow the police to get tough for one day for one hour and act like thugs mob enforcers instead of encouraging them to be positive role models for our children  Respecting respectable police officers is not necessary  Only fearing them isbrbrThats life in an authoritarian state with one ethnic or religious group dominating another and finding brutal ways to keep them in their place  Its not like this is an original idea with Trump,Not Cyberbullying

So what are they supposed to do lie to you Its true that certain illnesses wont be cured if you lose weight but I rather be at a healthy weight and manage it versus being obese and dealing with it If anything there are major benefits in losing weight such as not struggling to move fitting into clothes a lot better lowering your risk for obesity related risk and you even save more money when you control your portions at the supermarket She sounds like that doctor Kat that basically said and wrote the same things but she died from complications of being obese,Not Cyberbullying

Michelle you know that exercise can cause the weight gain  if you do anaerobic exercises a lot your muscles will grown but you knows it already Also diet also cause the weight gain because  diet is the sum of food consumed by a person but dieting means the change eating habits to lose fat tissues  For example the anaroxic persons get a diet and an exercise plan my close friend went through that to gain weight So by my opinion fatdoctor just manipulates the terms It is like if I have a lot jellyfish and can say that I have the fish tank by term it is correct but jellyfish are the medusaphase of certain gelatinous members of the subphylum Medusozoa medusas and not fish an aquatic anamniotic gillbearing vertebrate animal I am against the trend to see fatness as something good and positive I simply use the my professor in the human physiology method to understand why someone has wrong conclusion from the facts,Not Cyberbullying

Showing a mini version of Goosebumps is legends behavior As a 26 year old I loved how I got to be in the final years of that era Like in The Netherlands this era includes a horror society of children literature writers and some of the writers like the late Eddie C Bertin eventually stopped printing their childrens horror works so kids even a few years younger then me missed out To this day I want to petition to his relatives if I can translate the Valentina series along with a copy of the final book because its such a rare gem in secondhand stores He was primarily an adult horror author and it showed in the maturity levels as well as the fact it goes against childrens commercial writing as spoiler alert but the heroine Valentina dies at the end of the series which is supposed to be a huge nono in childrens books and the story ends with her best friend visiting her grave and context he messed around with magic in book 5 as hes looking for a love spell to cast on Valentina and it ends up going apocalyptically wrong And the biggest tragedy of it all was that Valentina was beginning to return his feelings because he always had her back when fighting the occult even after they killed her mom and he would have gotten together with her if he hadnt made that stupid and toxic decision typical of an impatient 14 year old It lowkey ages so well precisely because as an adult you can see how well horror movie  logic and the many stupid actions of the characters go well with the gripes of being an annoying or insecure teenager and how dark forces are preying on those and their naivety to get what they want Like its a whole lot less dumb and contrived to have 14 year olds fall into the trap of a monster then a grown adult who should have seen the red flags If I could Id honestly recommend it to anyone who still loves their old Goosebumps novels and people who like horror centering children precisely because of their young mindset like the It movies did the book shall not be named I will forever be cautious around Stephen King after THAT scene,Cyberbullying

I think the very first point about doctors telling people to go on a diet for anything is a real issue that happens to people Im not saying they dont need to lose weight im not saying the doctor doesnt know what theyre talking about but the doctors that are being criticised in such videos are the ones that completely overlook someones symptoms and ignore their pain because of their weight Fat people go in for anything and get told to lose weight Its wrong its unethical it SHOULD be criticisedbrbrSecondly diabetes type 2 isnt always someones fault thats sort of an insensitive thing to say There can be many causes and factors that put someone at a risk of getting t2d without it being their fault The doctor telling the commentor that they shouldnt do anything to prevent diabetes despite being pre diabetic is wrong but you too shouldnt spread misinformation considering the entire video is about the fact that the doctor is spreading misinformation,Cyberbullying

Being fat isnt unhealthy right up to the moment your arteries seize up,Not Cyberbullying
How do adipose cells fat cells get fat   Excess glucose in the blood triggers an insulin response  Insulin drives glucose out of the blood and into adipose cells through pores on the surface  Inside the adipose cell the glucose is combined with glycogen and become triglycerides  Triglycerides are too large to pass through the pores of the adipose cells and are trapped or stored inside  The adipose cells can expand to accommodate an almost unlimited number of triglycerides  The craving experienced after eating too many carbohydrates that become glucose in the blood is caused by the drop in glucose levels due to the insulin response This sets up a continuous cycle of craving eating spiking insulin release crashing  If left unchecked the result is obesity  The problem is not fatty foods not inactivity nor calories  it is a carbohydrate rich diet  This is why diets like the carnivore diet work so well  There are no carbohydrates at all  Without glucose in the blood another reaction takes place  Your body breaks down triglycerides into ketones and your body functions perfectly well using up all that energy stored inside your adipose cells  This is biology folks,Not Cyberbullying

You cant reverse it once you have type 2 diabetes you will always have type 2 diabetes excess sugar will always be a threat to you The good news is that excess sugar is under your control You can get addicted to sugar no sorry you can get addicted to the taste of sweet so artificial sweeteners can contribute to your addiction If you are addicted your mind will insist you are hungry which can turn the difficult task of losing weight into an impossible task The good news is that once you get your addiction under control you can now satisfy your body with a healthier diet and exercise and weight loss now becomes easy The sad news is that while new damage from excess sugar can be stopped much of the damage already done may be irreversible This takes not a diet but a drastic change in your diet every day The real secret is not to go hungry and not to eat foods you dont like but to eat the healthiest foods you find acceptable The sooner you get your type 2 diabetes under control the better the outlook I was borderline morbidly obese and suffering from many of the health issues that come with type 2 diabetes I am in my 8th year of having my blood sugar under control Life is better,Not Cyberbullying

Ive been a type 1 diabetic for almost 18 years I know a lot about it but also about type 2 Just cause someine has type 2 diabetes does not always mean they inherently caused it Excess weight does impact the likelihood of developing it but its not even a main factor The biggest factor is genetics Ive met type 2 diabetics who were very healthy and fat people who werent diabetic If someone is genetically predisposed to develope it being overweight doesnt help But please do not claim any diabetic brought it on themselves Its medically inaccurate spreads stigma about an already stigmatized disease and shames those suffering with it Also Michelle for the rate that you talk about diabetes people might start assuming your an endocrinologist I can barely watch your content because half your videos are just spreading misinformation about diabetes,Cyberbullying

As a former morbidly obese person I can confirm that stepping on a scale and being talked down to because your fat does not feel good makes you more insecure and depressed and leads to some weird eating escalations at least for me But what bothered me the most was the fact that non of those medical professionals ever offered any real help or had suggestions how to lose weight as I clearly was struggling to help myself And if the weight gain stems from mental health issues and addiction those need to be recognized diagnosed and treated then weightloss is actually possible So yeah I wished doctors were less judgmental and more helpful But that former doctor was just delusional harmful and outright dangerous Fat people fear the scale and those lectures because deep down we know they are right about us If there were not even a tiny spark of understanding in us we would not feel so afraid and offended I was fat for decades and know many big people so this comes from experience In the end I started losing weight out of a weird coincidence and kept going slowly but with a strong will Now after years of struggling I finally got help for my mental stuff and it turns out I have ADHD which was the reason for some of my food related problems I am on medication sober and I can manage my snacksidents If a doctor actually listend 20 years ago my life would have turned out differently,Cyberbullying

Uh yes it is Its called visceral fat Where did this chick get her medical degree Why is the Q community so weird Also it isnt just the medical community telling them to embrace their fatness There are a lot of bleeding heart liberals out there whining about fat shaming and shaming people who shame preaching acceptance diversity and inclusion and that includes obese people theres far too much coddling going on in this world today,Not Cyberbullying
So when I was going in for my gallbladder surgery my blood sugar was high and I was like yea it has been The nurse then let me know that a lot of people on kidney dialysis are there for complications due to diabetes I didnt even realize I could ruin my kidneys Terrified me,Cyberbullying
Ya definitely way out there Would not listen to anything they say brbrI do agree to an extent there is some prejudice against obese patients as soon as they walk in I have been brushed off many times and told to just lose weight really I had no clue br Had a doctor prescribe me blood pressures meds and diabetes meds without blood work results and only said you are fat w Dark arm hair I passed out at work bc the meds crashed my system bc I didnt need thembrbrBut as a doctor you should definitely bring up losing weight for extremely overweight patients I just dont agree with pushing fad diets and not doing testing first before prescribing meds,Cyberbullying
This person would rather spread misinformation and harm other people than admit that theres something wrong with themselves,Cyberbullying
as a disabled person ableism isnt mentioned also that has to be top 3 and fatphobia is not top 3 brbrI gained 5 pounds in like a week and I asked my doctor about it and she wasnt concerned at all There wasnt a bit of phobia of my body and I am a size 14 and my doctor is tiny Because I am a healthy weight  5 pounds I went on lexapro and dropped the 5 pounds just as easily I was concerned I would gain weight but it turns out I eat a lot gummy ropes and sleep a lot poorly when Im sadbrbrAlso weight is obviously related to health and the concerns you are being seen for it increases your risk for all kinds of things and the doctor has to do more to rule out that you havent had a clot or cancer when something is wrong because no matter your age obesity makes that much more likelybrbr I struggle enough in a healthy size body You cannot get migraines under control when overweight I know what having a migraine you cant stop is like even getting it treated is miserable I could not bathe myself I was like a big baby If my body gave me more migraines I would be knocking on the door of insanity,Cyberbullying

Im surprised that being confronted with their fatness is the issue they have with doctors Id be more concerned with the fact that some doctors write your complaints off because youre fat when there are actual issues that need to be addressed,Cyberbullying
Ive never had binge eating issues except when theres THC involved lol I tend to eat when Im hungry but because Im also on the autism spectrum that means I frequently forget to eat until I realize that I hate everything and everyone to an abnormal degree I can literally eat just one Dorito or five cheetos and then put the bag away I dunno if its good genes or what,Cyberbullying

It took me so very long to figure out who you were talking about because you kept saying he when there was that fat woman doctor on the screen ,Not Cyberbullying
As a person recovering but still struggling with an ED I do actually sympathize with people who have horrible anxiety about having to step on the scale at the doctors office I always tell them beforehand that Im an ED survivor and if the number on the scale is even slightly too high for my liking it can send me spiraling back into a full blown dangerous crash diet like 200 calories a day or less that can last days or even weeks so either dont weigh me or keep the number a secret So I do feel the girl who does not want to get on the scale Maybe for slightly different reasons but the fear is valid,Cyberbullying

I work in the medical field in the US Im NOT a Dr but the main reason you step on a scale at the doctors office iswait for itmedication Most medications that your doctor prescribes you have a kgmg dosage scale This means in order for them to correctly prescribe your medication and how much you should take they need to know your weight Getting bent out of shape saying you dont need to get weighed is the same as saying I dont need my meds Everything from Tylenol to mental health meds has a kgmg dose scale Its not that deep,Not Cyberbullying
 this world is full of cwacks ,Not Cyberbullying
All these people spewing fat acceptance are just people that lack acountability its easier to blame all your problems on externalinternal factors that had nothing to do with you and your choices in life They just want to live their lives indulging in their addiction and never be taken accountable for what they did to their bodies,Cyberbullying
Their message at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvtDOIfELaAot470750a bothers me because medical misogyny is a HUGE issue but coming out of the mouth of someone like this along with a bunch of nonsense it invalidates everyone working on resolving this longstanding problem Also for the life of me I cant figure out what pronouns that thing is supposed to use and Im getting mixed messages Apparently trans people will just pass with flying colors once they get to be a humansized chicken nugget because obesity lets men and women look exactly the samea blubberloaf Why bother with feminizing surgery and test when you can just change your gender with mcdonalds,Cyberbullying
With that acceptance movement Its just a movement to try to make yourself feel better for not having control over your health When I went from 200 lb to 40 I felt freaking fantastic I had more energy and stanma and motivation I felt healthy and I felt strong I gained weight back and now I feel miserable and as if I cant even jog a mile Being fat is torturous to your body I dont want to be crazy skinny and Ill probably never have abs But I want a healthy weight again and Im trying hard to get to that Because being healthy is being good to yourselfbrbrEdit Also just because this doctors a moron doesnt mean people in the comments can be transphobic They use the pronouns hehim Its not that hard to use it The doctor isnt a she they are he Even if I think this doctor is ridiculous and needs to be stopped with their false information We dont need to be transphobic,Not Cyberbullying
I lost 220lbs from my biggest weight Back when i was in the 380s i couldnt see my feet I couldnt tie my shoes without losing my breath I couldnt walk 2 blocks I couldnt fit into some chairs desks and whole ass cars Do i feel better now Is this body easier to LIVE in DUH HELL YEAH IT DOES People just want to eat So eat Why lie about it being unhealthy,Cyberbullying
funny how diet and exercise brought my dangerously high blood pressure down to normal levels and improved my sleep  its almost like losing weight made me healthier but that cant be true,Cyberbullying

Wheres the pug  The mini verse needs the pug,Not Cyberbullying
sadly there are problems with this but its really due to the quality of doctors and a sign you should see a better one if your condition is being dismissed due to weight this predatory doctor in this video is just as awful i used to be about 300 pounds now 125 and i went in with pain in both knees and was told to lose weight and no scans were ordered years later an MRI revealed i had inflammatory arthritis as part of my crohns and had lost most of my knee cartilage im 27  so i was frustrated with those doctors and sad in retrospect and this is the kind of shit that results in people seeing a fat doctor,Cyberbullying
So we have to stop the use the word obese and obesity Those are medical terms Should we stop using diabetic or cancer Obesity is proven note the word proven to be harmful to the health Thats why it was given a medical term,Cyberbullying
Visceral fat amount is VERY important I lost 86 lbs and was able to get my visceral fat rating to a 9  and is it not worrisome to have an overwhelming amount of fat around organs you need to eat drink breathe and stay alive brI do understand the annoyance of going to the doctor and being told to lose weight when what you have going on has nothing to do with your weight BUT this isnt your world and when you dont fit into the norm you kind of have to suck it up or lose the weight There are many ways to work around any health things PCOS to lose the weight,Cyberbullying

I work in a doctors office When I bring patients back I always try and joke when putting them on the scale Ill say something like Ok were going to start off by stepping on the liar or Hey I wont look just tell me what you want it say Had a guy recently try to get out of stepping on the scale saying he was 307 lbs I told him nope not going to get away with ithe was about 50 lbs heavier His history showed others putting in 307 lbs on previous visits That doesnt help him I get it sucks being obese but lets not lie about it It doesnt help you to not be honest,Cyberbullying

He doesnt believe in obesity let me guess she also believes in flat earth global warming being a hoax prn is good and vaccines bad Oh wait as dumb as all the other shit I listed also is its not trendy for pretend leftists at this point in time God these people are a trip and a half That said I wish these other doctors who are happy to talk about how antiscience she is about fatness diabetes etc would have the ballsovaries to talk about how trans ideology is likewise totally antiscience amongst many other things I know more and more judgments are happening in europe to try and curb said ideology but the average doctor is still too scared to speak up even when they know its bsbrbrAlso fix your racism sexism  LOL Sis you need to fix your internalized misogyny first before pointing the fingers at others Actually you know what guys you can have him,Cyberbullying
People are desperate to cling to the idea that weight loss doesnt solve anything but there are so many scientific studies that show the precise opposite The reason for that is simple even where an individual has a condition that is not weightrelated eg something they were born with being overweight bin additionb to that condition is an exacerbating factor 910 times because being overweight is an extra stress on the body And PSA many drug treatments have been demonstrated to be far less effective on overweight and obese people or to have much worse sideeffects This is because the increased dosage required to achieve the same results leads to higher toxicity andor worse side effects When doctors suggest weight loss its because theres a lot of evidence that it will help with the treatment of most conditions even if thats only by allowing regularsized doses of medication to be used,Cyberbullying
Ok since this does bug me Type 2 is genetic and isnt only linked to weight I say this because my 90 lbs grandmother had it for about the last 10 years of her life This is because she became less active when she lost her eyesight My mother and her siblings are all pre or type 2 My aunt who is as thin as her mom is pre while my mom is type 2 do to being in a wheelchair,Not Cyberbullying

Fat acceptance movement More like fat acceptance rollment,Not Cyberbullying
Doctors make everyone  every visit step on the scale Why Because a change in weight  in either direction  can be a clear symptom of something else going on I had 2 appointments the same week with the same Dr I was weighed both times and its a good thing because it managed to catch something that otherwise would have gone unnoticed until it was potentially life threatening  They dont weigh people just for the sake of it or to shame anyone  These people need to get over themselves and actually experience something that they havent created or imagined for themselves Must be nice to live in a world where your only problems are the imaginary ones you complain about on the internet,Cyberbullying
I do not understand how anyone falls for this stuff I am obese and I do not want to be I am trying to work on my eating habits because they are terrible and long engrained from childhood But I if lose weight I can do so much more I went out kayaking to a beautiful spring with friends today and it was fun but I can only handle short runs I hope to do longer runs eventually,Not Cyberbullying

the diabetes propaganda in the FA movement is soooo horrifying ive taken care of numerous patients as young as in their thirties who have many missing fingers and toes already a lot of them also fight doctorhospital diets to add onto that these obese patients tend to develop COPD and it is AWFUL we had a frequent flyer patient basically means they come in and out A LOT to where the hospital staff instantly recognizes their name when theyre in the ER and are being transferred to us we had a patient who came in weeklybiweekly and monthly at the absolute most with horrible COPD he never ONCE followed his diet except for 2 nurses who refused to tolerate his BS lol he would scream and complain until the kitchen staff literally doubled his portions until they were spilling off of the plate and yes all of these people are bitter and miserable especially the ones with diabetes if you dont want to prickle your fingertips daily to monitor your blood sugar until theyre extremely hard from all of the pricks diet,Cyberbullying

I have to go on a scale whenever I see my neurologist here in Ireland along with taking my blood pressure Theyve caught other underlying issues just by doing that I have a very unhealthy relationship with weighing scales so I just look up and they take down my weight Its normal and happens at every doctors appointment My mother had diabetes but she kept eating so much sugar to the point it developed into type 2 diabetes which was completely her fault Buying a giant cake at the shop and hiding it from my dad and eating it in secret They never want to take accountability I actually have muscles in my legs now from working out and it makes me feel so good Ive never been obese only slightly overweight when I was younger and I think life is too short to not have that cookie but at the same time dont have fifty cookies  love you Michelle,Not Cyberbullying

Fat around organs is very real Fat deposition is a way to store energy not immediately needed in regions like the cheeks breasts thighs abdomen some organs like the kidneys liver and so on Women do have fat pads in regions like the back too to serve as cushioning for carrying a childsupposedly Its a normal physiological process But when the body keeps recieving more of it and the levels of activity drop the body has to store it because it doesnt need that and cant let it circulate Uncontrolled this can lead to pressure on different organs like joints and internal organs deposit in regions like the forehead and when everything fails fat accumulates in the blood vessels causing CAD or PAD or increase risk for a fat embolism as a result of conditions like fatty liver or an orthopaedic injury Uncommon but fatal I can list many more complications of being obese but these are the main ones off the top of my head,Cyberbullying

He said if ya read it like you do sure It sounds like a broad condemnation of ALL gay sex Insinuating that some gay sex is not a sin correct Well since marriage was defined BY God as between one man one woman that means two men or two women could NEVER be married Right And that means ANY sex between two men would ALWAYS be sexual immorality It will always be a sin because same sex marriage is not a thing It doesnt exist to God We could allow a man to marry a tree or squirrel by our standard of marriage give them a certificate of marriage etc but that doesnt mean they ARE married in the sight of God There is not one example where two men or women can have sexual relations and it NOT be sinful In short since marriage isnt an option sex isnt either,Not Cyberbullying

Good debate   I would make one correction thoughGod does not give us each different temptations   Read James 113   The things that we are tempted with is simply the result of original sin   I have no doubt that there are people who are literally born was unnatural desires towards the same sex  When people say they are born that way I do not disagree that men and women can be born with a desire to be with the same sex  However to give into these desires is still a choice   The fact of the matter is we are all born sinners  This is why Jesus says we have to be born again  Once we are born again he will transform our hearts and minds back to the natural order that he originally intended,Not Cyberbullying

The part of this debate I dont think was done properly is how the two continue to interrupt Robertson If someone is giving their explanation you let them continue to speak without interruption That is how you not only save time by forcing the other person repeat themselves but you miss parts of what they say as you interrupt thembrIn a debate when you interrupt the other also shows you are not listening to the other debater you are locking and loading words to hit them with Therefore as you interrupt someone you are not hearing what they are saying you are mentally readying your word When you do this you miss words from your opponent you could later use as a foundation to reply tobrI agree that Robertson is a false teacherbrI have desires for wealth that is stronger than sexual urges That does not mean I can become a preacher and twist the words in the Bible that deals with monetary riches and wealth One who has what feels like a natural urge but that urge is against Gods word then one must fight day and night to resist that urge It is not to say This is what I find to be natural within my being so it must come from God or be a natural part of humanity no if you have a prohibited urge and desire you must fight it not give into that temptationbrThe more you fight and resist that temptation the easier it is to continue fighting and resisting until the temptation no longer holds power over you,Not Cyberbullying

Hes correct that you have to consider historical context Hermeneutics are INCREDIBLY important But not in this case It applies moreso in cases like when Paul writes to Corinth and directs women to be silent in church That appears ONLY in that letter despite him having written to many other churches The reason is because in that specific church there was a femaleonly pagan cult that involved screaming and ripping each others clothing off and having orgies Many young believers in the early corinthian church attempted to do this practice at first so basically Paul was like No no Thats bad Dont let them do that better to be silent than to cause disruption of that kind That is hermeneutics this is just justification,Not Cyberbullying

Hey layze I just wanted to tell you why they got married so fast but before that the guy in the video is doing sins and it is prohibited in Islam to do such things But the reason why Muslims get married so fast is because in Islam  Muslims are prohibited from dating and touching the other gender as in shaking hands and etc So instead the guy meets the girls family and asks for her hand and they get to know each other and after around 26 months or so they end up doing Nikkah religious marriage so that they can be married through religion and now can finally hold hands and stuff and then 1 month to 12 weeks later we usually have weddings,Cyberbullying

I visited a Subway here in Indianapolis if you want to learn the subways that are owned from foreigners Consumers beware  My son and I visited an establishment that was owned by foreigners we ordered are usually and I was shocked on the price thought it was a little pricey from my past visit to a subway just days previous so the next day I went to another location owned by 100 American and my son and I ordered exactly the same meals but from a different Subway the Price for the same meals was almost 800 differenceSo I investigated the foreigners will charge for single items instead of combo and they know what they are doing  I reported the dishonesty to Subway head office and I found that the subway that was dishonest was in trouble for leaving out items on a meal but over charging for them stealing from you If a 12 inch sandwich is supposed to have 10 tomatoes on it they would put half if you did not catch them leaving product off that was on you  the Office explained that the Subway franchise I visited was famous for dishonest practices and Subway incorporated fined and put them on warning  After this happening Ive caught several other companies owned by foreigners doing this dishonest practiceSince I exploited the Subway of corruption they have sold it and walked away I shared this story so others can be aware of this fraud businesses owned from foreigners are committing ,Cyberbullying

An excellent debate that has set a benchmark for future Presidential and VP debates The sustained focus on issues healthy acknowledgement of validity in the opponents points clear and meaningful attempt to respond to questions made it a very good debate Both VP aspirants batted solidly and articulated the policies and positions of their respective captains much better than Harris or Trump could Kudos to both Vance and Walz for that While Vance showed a clear edge with his astute knowledge and oratory Walz was on the back foot as his teammate is a cackling hyena and some of their policies are rather indefensible Yet another positive was both moderators were mostly professional unlike in the Presidential debate where Trump was debate a team of three,Not Cyberbullying
Interesting how much happier people are when we only have one party Two politicians whos interests align exactly for the political class and everyone is so happy about them being civil with each other We should just stop having elections and let politicians decide who is in charge by the youtube comments youd think that would make everyone a lot happier if they never had to confront anyone or work towards their own interests haha,Not Cyberbullying

unbiased opinion from someone with no skin in the game Vances Yale experience was on show last night  he is a skilled debater  I still feel we dont know the real Vance he definitely holds conservative values but I genuinely dont believe him to be as extreme and evangelical as many of his colleagues including Mr Trump  I am from a country where for too long the church and state were too closely connected and this has had dire consequences for the women and children of my country which are still being uncovered today I fundamentally believe religion and religious beliefs are personal and should not be used to develop policy and laws  on both sides I think Tim Walz is genuine solid and a fundamentally a good person not as articulate and sleek a debater as Vance but he stepped up and did a great job,Not Cyberbullying
I hope Trump wins because we need a populist and someone who isnt an employee to the corrupt state but rather working for the American people first With that said its a breath of fresh air to have someone with his policies carry himself in away that the American people can all respect This is why I wanted Vivek to win though that was never going to happen many people cant get past the way trump talks to actually focus on what hes trying to do for the country,Not Cyberbullying

This is just fucking ridiculous at this point some people are fat because the worst type of food for you is the cheapest option growing up keeping fresh fruit and vegies wasnt cheap for a snack but it was easier to buy a bag of chips and because ur a kid and u dont know how to tell ur self no so u eat till ur full and then u put the bag of chips away then a few hours later mama makes dinner and u eat till ur full again its not that parents encourage bad eating habits its just i didnt know how badly my habbits were untill i put some weight on shit happens u cant say fat is unhealthy because fat is normal its apart of animal kingdom we get fat to hibernate it just extra food storage just loads of people now dont need a diet they need to fast,Cyberbullying

For tens of thousands of years humans had to work very hard to acquire food For the majority of our existence we broke even in terms of energy gain vs energy expense with food The gain was slightly more give the fact that were still around obviously brIts only for the last couple of decades where food has become so widespread available in extreme abundance topped off with a capitalistic system whos single purpose it is to sell the consumer as much as possible and you got the perfect recipe for a global obesity epidemic brHumans are literally gorging themselves to death as a result of our own success Were not cognitively wired to resist our urges to eat its a result of thousands of years of habit and evolution What we can do however is become consciously aware of this phenomenon and teach our kids how to responsibly handle food Which is the exact opposite of body positivity,Not Cyberbullying

How do they afford this lifestyle,Not Cyberbullying
14 mins in I couldnt disagree more mate Unless you were raised in poor Britain in the 90s you have no idea how little we knew about nutrition Knowbody cared I didnt know fruit has sugar till I started a kitchen job at 16 My grandparents used to give us sugar sandwiches if we were hungry cause it tasted like cake and no one could afford cakes This is real life bro Im now 33 and go to great lengths just to maintain a chubby physique and not of over the deep end I will forever have issues around food now because of that time Thats why schools try so hard now to teach about healthy eating Also when I was a kid sugar was in no way a bad thing Fat was the enemy in all forms,Cyberbullying
Literally the only thing a man should and must eat is pure natural meat Veggies and fruits are just a gmo hoax People eat this crap since the end of 1940s event Back in history this was quotfoodquot for slaves to keep them weak but yet alive to do the work they were suppose to do Meat was only for the strong and rich,Not Cyberbullying
I agree that people should be allowed to do whatever as long as it doesnt hurt others HOWEVER this is harmful It gives the impression that being morbidly obese is fun and you will be happy It encourages people to not eat healthy or work out and to become obese Its not okay,Not Cyberbullying
No way hes happy in his body He feels like shit every single day has trouble going to the bathroom getting in and out of bed basic things we all take for granted,Cyberbullying
The problem here is that in the UK where this was filmed morbid obesity does hurt other people We have public healthcare and it isnt very good Every fat person who requires medical resources is taking those resources away from someone else who needs thembrIMO selfinflicted health conditions caused by things like obesity or smoking should not be covered by public healthcare,Cyberbullying

I think the moment hes had kids his obesity isnt only his personal problem anymore because obviously as a dad you are the primary role model for your kids If you dont have shame about something thats so negativly impactful to you weak people would give in easily Im confident shame is a driving motivator for many people to NOT become fat shame is good I think on  the topic of mental health in this subject would simply be representative if you asked a formerly thin person gone fat and a formerly fat person gone thin about how they feel about it and see whos gonna be most enthusiastic and inspirational speaking about their journey,Not Cyberbullying
Yeah I knwo everything that was bad in the internet since 1999 all the shit that was flowing in 4chan and lime wire and torrents you people dont know LOL,Cyberbullying

I weigh 110kg and have been overweight for many years I used to be slim but my current belly has significantly reduced my quality of life both healthwise and in terms of selfesteem especially around women I wouldnt wish this on anyone I believe those who defend this lifestyle are in denial unable to see their own potential to make positive changes,Not Cyberbullying
My wife is a doctor I can tell you that obese people cost everyone a lot They require way more care surgeries prescriptions and as such are part of why our insurance premiums are so high and our doctors are so stressed,Not Cyberbullying
such an L take on this we already have wayy too much data to know its a bad idea Just like smoking we put restrictions on it after over 50 years of data accumulated from hundreds of thousands of people I mean yes leave them alone to being fat but to assume that the market will correct itself when the media is selective about what is censored and reported on its like quothey casualties will happen unnecessarily because they have the freedom to hurt themselvesquot Change it from being obese to cutting yourself  blood letting like they did back in the day for whiter skin Its just like of course its a bad idea Which i dont think he denies but the way he seems to not only dismiss but to say leave them alone and celebrate their freedom to do it on a platform that they clearly accelerate the issue His take like many others is a very self centric way of thinking versus the community way which is obviously how humans live in 2 simultaneous parallels,Not Cyberbullying

people ofc should have the freedom to do what they want but that doesnt mean its good its objectively selfish for someone with kids to be that fat knowing theyll die young and leave their kids without a father  its great when you can be age 80 and your mom and dad are still alive and healthy as one can be at age 100 and your kids are 60 their kids are 40 their kids are 20 their kids are newborns its the whole concept of wanting to have kids when youre still young and healthy so you can go out and play football with them go on hikes etc and let them live most of their lives without the trauma of having dead parents brbeing 15 and having your dad die of obesity is terrible,Cyberbullying

See this is why Jenna Marbles is a good person She didnt downplay any of what happened that led to her apologizing she didnt blame anyone she didnt defend her actions she simply and earnestly apologized and sought to validate those who were hurt and better herself She did the right thing and she didnt victimize herself or blame anyone She knew what she did was wrong and wanted to better herself She also didnt apologize to gain good faith back she simply wanted to apologize to those she hurt and validate them She did it for purely selfless reasons Because shes a true philanthropistbrI really hope shes happy and doing well for herself,Not Cyberbullying

Super wierd Creepy No its criminal Calling it wierd creepy or cringe is shining a light on an action but being wierd creepy or cringe is also an excuse that the actions committed dont warrant full accountability An adult engaging with minors in a sexual discussion that goes beyond the realm of education or mentorship is criminal Im part way through this video of yours and I hope you call the spade a spade,Not Cyberbullying

The thing about children in her audience is because shes brought up children onto the stage during her live shows and done REALLY inappropriate stuff to them Shes had a little boy pat her crotch or smth dont remember that exactly and shamed a girl for wearing short shorts because thats like one of her common jokes and had her spread her legs to the audience,Not Cyberbullying

Colleen does not care she is going to be canceled so why bother saying sorry,Cyberbullying
Does she does she actually iknowi what accountability means This is a genuine question because I dont think she does The definition of accountability is to hold yourself responsible for your actions Someone who is accountable is someone who would realize they did wrong admit to doing wrong so as to not throw anyone else under the bus and then do whatever it takes to redeem themselves This is the definition google gave me quotYou dont blame others or make excuses and you do what you can to make amends when things go wrongquotbrbrLets recap She denies that anything happened starts accusing her audience of spreading lies for fun accuses them of over exaggerating claims that she is the victim and then changes her story to I did do it kinda for no reason than to accuse the audience of ignoring that she quotalready DID fix thingsquot Thats a lot of words and none of them are actually something an accountable person would say,Cyberbullying

Colleen does not care she is going to be canceled so why bother saying sorry,Cyberbullying
Does she does she actually iknowi what accountability means This is a genuine question because I dont think she does The definition of accountability is to hold yourself responsible for your actions Someone who is accountable is someone who would realize they did wrong admit to doing wrong so as to not throw anyone else under the bus and then do whatever it takes to redeem themselves This is the definition google gave me quotYou dont blame others or make excuses and you do what you can to make amends when things go wrongquotbrbrLets recap She denies that anything happened starts accusing her audience of spreading lies for fun accuses them of over exaggerating claims that she is the victim and then changes her story to I did do it kinda for no reason than to accuse the audience of ignoring that she quotalready DID fix thingsquot Thats a lot of words and none of them are actually something an accountable person would say,Cyberbullying

His argument is so fundamentally flawed amd juvenile It isnt quotpoor peoplequot that are profiting from fossil fuel extraction but the fossil fuel companies that have know about climate change since the 1970s covered up their findings and bribed politicians to continue with the status quo Fine if you dont care or want to believe in climate change but millions die and suffer from diseases related to the air and water pollution from fossil fuel extraction and processing but I guess that doesnt matter because it isnt sudden and in your face to see everyday China cares about climate change as it now the market leader in solar panels EV and other green technologies and installing more green energy capacity than any other country but facts dont line up with the beliefs you want to hold,Cyberbullying

"The Origins of Woke
brThe term woke originated in African American communities in the United States particularly within AAVE It was initially used to describe someone who was aware of and knowledgeable about the systemic injustices faced by marginalized communities especially people of color Derived from African American Vernacular English it emerged as a form of resistance against oppression and inequality brDisgruntled White Conservative Influences has refined WOKE into a white mans word They could not find another word for themselves the dumb asses hahaha",Not Cyberbullying

One point Id argue that Climate Change would be fairly high on XJP priority list China is a 4000 year old civilization and XJP doesnt have to worry about ruling terms and reelection its stewardship of an established civilization not the building of a new one There is a fundamental difference in mentality there which is important to highlight as the speaker illustrates a relatable scenario using relatable imagery for XJPs life brbrSustainability in that context would be an underlying principle and if one takes a look at Chinas adoption of sustainable measures the reality reinforces this statement,Not Cyberbullying

The problem with rewarding and then debasing quotvictimhoodquot is that it takes away from actual victims those who have been systematically repressed due to their disadvantages whether thats a disability their skin colour their social background or simply down to the fact they dont have a voice in the constant clamour that is the woke far left vs the nonexistent far right rhetoric  Thus we end up with an overprivileged brainwashed majority who think that their imagined struggles and first world problems deserve more attention and remedy than those who are victims of the generational oppression caused by the ancestral power of these privileged classes,Cyberbullying

Just to be clear about the idea that says that is good is that which works theres no moral content to that which works Pragmatism is a distinctly American philosophy that has some merit however if that which works is evil then that which works cannot be the good Pragmatism ism is a suffix for a life and worldview If an ism is attached an idea that idea is a philosophical assertion for truth If something works now will it work at all times No it does not That which works is often temporal and creates other problems exponentially Pragmatism is abscessed with solving problems but never considers the long term consequence Does that sound familiar in our government that keeps kicking the can down the road to later solve it when it creates a more serious problem brbrSorry people but life is going to be difficult and no amount of that which works is going to ultimately solve those problems That means we are continually responding to problems created a previous problems that created several more problemsbrbrNow for this super structure idea that is way over simplified To have some value are sacred then that value must be eternally true If a value is only of human preference it will not ever be an ultimate value All values must be measured by an ultimate source that has the power to enforce those values ultimately If there is no consequence ultimately then all values are temporal and I may pursue my own personal interest and use any means to attain it If the wicked prosper then wickedness works right Then again if there is no ultimate value then good and evil do not exist That which works has many avenues for that which is good The good is that which humans say is good,Not Cyberbullying
All of these woke ideas inclusion victimhood feeling good at all costs without actually being good They all stem from the women being raised to positions of power they will give up the fight for what is right for what is feels good every time To women the only thing that matters is dont be mean which means dont tell the truth dont look at problems dont point out anything thats abnormal Were all in this together were all love we need to cherish each others experience And none of this absolutely none of it as a position in the hierarchies of our society These ideas are meant to be at home in our families and carried out into the world and used in the decision processes for doing battle in business or life these are the underlying values that make us human they are not values that you can lead a society success Running a society with these values will lead to failure and destruction and dominance by others,Not Cyberbullying

Im not woke but Im a leftist And hes spitting bullshit that only morons would actually take for facts First of all making changes to the way we consume is what would bring positive climate change the west is the biggest consumer of Chinese products So the West is indeed responsible for China being the biggest polluter in the world And if the West had any good intentions they would boycott products that are not responsibly produced And that would actually make China prosper even more as they can start selling these products at higher margins These studies that show the biggest polluters in the world dont take into account when a country contributes to another countries pollution For example the biggest consumer of Chinese products is the US Therefore the US should be considered the biggest polluter and not China,Cyberbullying

so if I am going to distill his argument down it would read something like fix poverty through technology and that will do a lot to curbing the advance of what he perceives as the negative effects of climate change  Am I hearing him right and not getting myself all confused  greatthen he better hope that technology helps us skip the step where the poor of china and India get cheap carsIn the extraordinarily short history of the human race when have technological breakthroughs EVER been either CLEAN or CHEAP   This is a load of bollocks  I am nearly 50 and I have no love lost for the woke or the asleep or the rightleft or the republicandemocrat  it is all just a diversion and division tactic if you were to ask me but this speech is not so much inspiring as its a load of bollocks,Cyberbullying

His argument is so fundamentally flawed amd juvenile It isnt quotpoor peoplequot that are profiting from fossil fuel extraction but the fossil fuel companies that have know about climate change since the 1970s covered up their findings and bribed politicians to continue with the status quo Fine if you dont care or want to believe in climate change but millions die and suffer from diseases related to the air and water pollution from fossil fuel extraction and processing but I guess that doesnt matter because it isnt sudden and in your face to see everyday China cares about climate change as it now the market leader in solar panels EV and other green technologies and installing more green energy capacity than any other country but facts dont line up with the beliefs you want to hold,Cyberbullying

The UK outsources most of their production just like most 1st world countries I assure you that the UK is responsible for more than 2 of carbon emissions Theyre just funding it on different soil So yes there is more that could be done But they wont because its outsourced for the same reason the rich are not going to foot the bill for people working and creating to create CHEAP renewable energy money Cost and profit margins are the deciding factor Thats why we complain because those of us working and creating will have the ideas but most of us will never have the money to actually fund these endeavors The people who do and who will will do it for profit And unless many companies with the funds globally come together and decide theyre going to end world hunger provide clean water and provide renewable energy thats not going to change,Not Cyberbullying

"The Origins of Woke
brThe term woke originated in African American communities in the United States particularly within AAVE It was initially used to describe someone who was aware of and knowledgeable about the systemic injustices faced by marginalized communities especially people of color Derived from African American Vernacular English it emerged as a form of resistance against oppression and inequality brDisgruntled White Conservative Influences has refined WOKE into a white mans word They could not find another word for themselves the dumb asses hahaha",Not Cyberbullying

One point Id argue that Climate Change would be fairly high on XJP priority list China is a 4000 year old civilization and XJP doesnt have to worry about ruling terms and reelection its stewardship of an established civilization not the building of a new one There is a fundamental difference in mentality there which is important to highlight as the speaker illustrates a relatable scenario using relatable imagery for XJPs life brbrSustainability in that context would be an underlying principle and if one takes a look at Chinas adoption of sustainable measures the reality reinforces this statement,Not Cyberbullying

KONSTANTIN BEST INTERVIEWSbr,Not Cyberbullying
What a great conversation Thank You,Not Cyberbullying
Konstantin is so clear and has so much clarity in his words he says so much using simple and few words while staying focused on the point The host on the other hand says so little using complex words in a over drawn out babble of words that rambles on and on to the point of losing focus,Not Cyberbullying

The smarter a person gets the more evil he becomes,Cyberbullying
Just to be clear about the idea that says that is good is that which works theres no moral content to that which works Pragmatism is a distinctly American philosophy that has some merit however if that which works is evil then that which works cannot be the good Pragmatism ism is a suffix for a life and worldview If an ism is attached an idea that idea is a philosophical assertion for truth If something works now will it work at all times No it does not That which works is often temporal and creates other problems exponentially Pragmatism is abscessed with solving problems but never considers the long term consequence Does that sound familiar in our government that keeps kicking the can down the road to later solve it when it creates a more serious problem brbrSorry people but life is going to be difficult and no amount of that which works is going to ultimately solve those problems That means we are continually responding to problems created a previous problems that created several more problemsbrbrNow for this super structure idea that is way over simplified To have some value are sacred then that value must be eternally true If a value is only of human preference it will not ever be an ultimate value All values must be measured by an ultimate source that has the power to enforce those values ultimately If there is no consequence ultimately then all values are temporal and I may pursue my own personal interest and use any means to attain it If the wicked prosper then wickedness works right Then again if there is no ultimate value then good and evil do not exist That which works has many avenues for that which is good The good is that which humans say is good,Not Cyberbullying
All of these woke ideas inclusion victimhood feeling good at all costs without actually being good They all stem from the women being raised to positions of power they will give up the fight for what is right for what is feels good every time To women the only thing that matters is dont be mean which means dont tell the truth dont look at problems dont point out anything thats abnormal Were all in this together were all love we need to cherish each others experience And none of this absolutely none of it as a position in the hierarchies of our society These ideas are meant to be at home in our families and carried out into the world and used in the decision processes for doing battle in business or life these are the underlying values that make us human they are not values that you can lead a society success Running a society with these values will lead to failure and destruction and dominance by others,Not Cyberbullying

Zionism is more dangerous than Nazism because You cannot distinguish who is a Jew and who is a Zionist Who is playing offer who is ZionistbrThey exploit the Holocaust card and the antisemitism card Christian Zionists claim they are helping Jews Christian Zionism is an extreme ideology that supports Israel seeing it as fulfilling biblical prophecy for Jesuss Second Coming Armageddon and the judgment of nonChristians Jewish Zionists say they are a minority and the majority of Zionists are Christian Very few people have the time to understand what Zionism truly is The power of Zionism lies in its ability to corrupt representatives in Western countries with money making them support the colonialist state and even banning TikTok from criticizing Israel Zionists have big control over media from newspapers to radio TV YouTube and Facebook Israeli Zionists kill and attack any place in the West and then retreat to Israel Zionists can ruin your career almost anywhere in the West by labeling you as antisemitic,Cyberbullying

The idea that we are ruining the world is an old one  Even the Bible in Revelations God said he would destroy those quotruining the Earthquot  The problem is the way the quotwokequot crowd decides to do it  The fact is that they dont have real power to enact change they have no actual vote  They can pressure companies to go along for a short time but those companies will never change the fundamental core of how they pollute just to please this generations loud hippiesbrbr  Of course if the world doesnt act they cant complain if God does return to save us from ourselves right when we are about to go extinct for not stopping the global damage to the planet  Im not sure if it will happen in my lifetime but so far the world is getting worse more pollution can not be a good thing  The Earth is finite and it cant take an infinite amount of abuse without there being consequences,Cyberbullying

Im not woke but Im a leftist And hes spitting bullshit that only morons would actually take for facts First of all making changes to the way we consume is what would bring positive climate change the west is the biggest consumer of Chinese products So the West is indeed responsible for China being the biggest polluter in the world And if the West had any good intentions they would boycott products that are not responsibly produced And that would actually make China prosper even more as they can start selling these products at higher margins These studies that show the biggest polluters in the world dont take into account when a country contributes to another countries pollution For example the biggest consumer of Chinese products is the US Therefore the US should be considered the biggest polluter and not China,Cyberbullying

so if I am going to distill his argument down it would read something like fix poverty through technology and that will do a lot to curbing the advance of what he perceives as the negative effects of climate change  Am I hearing him right and not getting myself all confused  greatthen he better hope that technology helps us skip the step where the poor of china and India get cheap carsIn the extraordinarily short history of the human race when have technological breakthroughs EVER been either CLEAN or CHEAP   This is a load of bollocks  I am nearly 50 and I have no love lost for the woke or the asleep or the rightleft or the republicandemocrat  it is all just a diversion and division tactic if you were to ask me but this speech is not so much inspiring as its a load of bollocks,Cyberbullying
