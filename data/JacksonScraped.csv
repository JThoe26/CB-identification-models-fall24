‘Middle school relationship that lasts 2 weeks’ type beat
"u are really good at singing, but im much better at sarcasm"
The girl looks like she is in her 20s while my dude over here seems like he just hit 7
bruh we bullied this song to death back in the day 💀
2016: people came to listen the song<br>2020: people came to see the dislikes<br>same thing in 2021 i guess<br>oh- we’re already in 2022?
Why no one be talking about his weird ass sleeveless hoodie...
I’m so ashamed this is gonna be in my watch history
"No matter how bad you think this song is, life was fire when it dropped."
Third grade looks tough
”Sweatshirt&quot; By autotune featuring Jacob Sartorius
“No makeup with some sweatpants on.” <br>   <b>Girl is wearing overalls</b>
"As cringy as this song is, we all got fond memories of 2016 that we can’t forget"
Jacob don&#39;t listen to all the haters. Listen to me. I hate you
1 fucking million dislikes im so fucking happy
"Guys, stop making fun of this song, it saved my life! I was in a coma and the nurse turned on the radio and this song was on so I got up and turned it off"
You know what. Honestly. Respect to this dude for keeping this song up. I feel like most people would’ve taken it down
"Well, it&#39;s a no for me, Jacob."
"After keeping this song as my alarm at 6 am, I started waking up at 5:30 am"
Thanks to you Jacob the world has run out of bleach.
this a hood classic idc what yall say
She never wore his sweatshirt.
I didn’t know they had lockers in elementary school
<b>When he catches feelings for the teacher</b>
is it weird this makes me so nostalgic now and I miss this era badly 💀
Why does he look like he’s 10 and she’s like 17?
This really has 3 times more dislikes than likes. I’m dead
Even his clothes run away from him
Can&#39;t let gng know I fw this 💀
Let&#39;s get this comment to have more likes than the actual video!
Imagine being 15 and a 3rd grader gets accepted into your highscjool and forces you to put on his XXS swearshirt.
1000 likes and ill make this my ringtone...
Lowkey crazy nostalgia from 6th grade 😭 and a crazy amount of disappointment in me coming back to watch this
I’m surprised the teacher didn’t tell Jacob to put his hood down like cmon horrible teaching 0/10
my bleach killed itself before I could drink it. ..
why is a 1st grader hitten on a teacher.<br>what are these likes coming from
This is the greatest song ever made in the entire musical industry. I was going through so much but this song changed how my depression went. It only made me more depressed
I love the way she never actually put the sweatshirt on😂
"Who else came here just to read the comments, and not even watch the video?"
Me: Mom can we get kidz bop<br>Mom: no we got kidz bop at home<br>Kidz bop at home:
people were so mean about this song omg 😭
"Lyrics need some work, they&#39;re appalling mate. Good luck on your next song, not like it can be much worse."
<b>someone tell Willy Wonka that one of his Oompa Loompas escaped</b>
Who came at the end of 2019 to see how many likes and dislikes there are
Say what you want but Jacob has some hidden talent. KEEP IT HIDDEN 🔥🔥🔥
Even his clothes can&#39;t stand him....wow
I started dying when the sweatshirt started crawlin&#39; around then i went to go read the comments to laugh even harder and here&#39;s what I found:<br>-he must not wash that thing because there&#39;s enough bacteria for it to just get up and walk<br>-why does a sweatshirt dance better than him<br>-everybody&#39;s gangsta until he sweatshirt starts movin&#39;<br>I&#39;m crying lmaoo
Its so sad how i can no longer see the dislikes
we were crazy in 2016 this isn&#39;t thaaat bad
my mom walked in on and i changed to porn because it was easier to explain
My dad walked in and I switched to porn because it was easier to explain.
This made me go to Justin Bieber - Baby and undislike it.
It’s kinda fucked up how much cyber bullying this kid went through back then
Lol the ad I had before the video was a bleach ad... I wish I didn&#39;t skip it
This song is actually pretty good.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>If you mute it.
Lets make it to 2 million Dislikes
i’d do anything to go back to this time
that shirt has cleaned the floor more than the janitor&#39;s mop and he still had the audacity to give it to her
Jacob legit sounds like spongebob going through puberty

"Well, time to clear my history"
Life was simple when this came out
"If this was age restricted, there wouldn&#39;t be any likes."

"&quot;Chillin with her hair tie, no makeup with her sweatpants on&quot;<br><br>the girl: <b>not wearing a hairtie, has makeup on, and isnt wearing sweatpants</b>"

I switched to porn when mom  came in because it&#39;s easier to explain
Even the sweatshirt itself ran away from his crusty ass 😂

"Don&#39;t know why I randomely remembered this obomination, but it is nostalgic either way"
Let&#39;s be honest your voice was really good and the beat was cool but what the fu*** Men. Is that girl even wanna wear your sweat shirt Next time think twice before you release a bit it&#39;s not about the song but also to entertain the people

Nostalgiaaa. Randomly thought about this song.. it’s actually good 🤣
"I’m gonna be honest, Jacob was about 13 (??) when he made this, the amount of hate he probably got is kinda sad. Yes this is the internet and yes the song isn’t the best, but it’s not the worst either. All I’m saying is, being like 13-14 and getting all this hate must be kinda harsh, maybe just some common criticism instead? Idk maybe I’m just soft but I know how I’d feel if I got this must shit at 13 😭"
Blud be talking bout The ick song and This what he made- Should be ashamed what so ever bruh
Why am I nostalgic from this ☠️
"Look I’m sorry but I feel like this song hits the sped people who have a thing for ear worms, and it’s okay for me to say that bc I was and am a sped kid/ adult lmao"

Ain&#39;t no way 2016 was 8 yrs ago

I know he was just 13 but this song is horrible
I remember hating on this so hard when I was 11. The hook is actually good. I feel bad we all collectively bullied a 13 year old for making musicallys and songs. 2016-2019 was peak
This song makes me realize how talented Justin Bieber is.
anyone else come on here just for memories 👀
That’s actually wild
Omg it&#39;s even worse than I remember
THIS IS FIRE🔥🔥🔥SOMEONE PUT IT OUT🗑️🗑️🗑️
"bro i swear this aint even bad, if justin bieber dropped this back in the day wouldve been a hit..."
"Holy fuck, almost 7 years."
Used to hate it but man I miss this era bro we all finishing high school 2016 was truly something special
THESE COMMENTS ARE GOLDD but ngl this is so catchy
"damn, the like to dislike ratio is crazy"
"There’s no way that his sweat shirt fits her, my guy is built like a seven year-ols"
Why do i lowkey like it
The singing is bum cheeks but the lyrics are kinda catchy
"As someone who wants to study medicine and become a surgeon or a generally helpful paramedic, I didn&#39;t know the migraine I achieved after watching this video was possible, after this, I refused to open my eyes and covered my ears for 4 straight minutes to meditate how big of a nose dive my mental gave after processing 2 minutes of the most painful audio-visual experience of my life, also if you are gonna make a video about a sweatshirt and wanting a girl to wear it to remember you, make her wear it, because if not it makes the song pointless."
why was no one freaked the fuck out theres a crawling sweatshirt what is this saw trap
I need help 💀
This is girl is in Manifest
CHILLIN WIDDA HAIR TIE 🔥🔥💪🔥
i strangled my dog watching this
Who’s here in 2024 <br>👇

7 YEARS AND WE STILL HATING 🗣🔥🔥
I remember when everybody was shitting on dis dude fa dis shit 😂
I completly forgot this dude existed for a whole 7 years
I honestly think this is a great song probably one of the better songs out there and if you think I’m lying then you’re right
The classic of days of the internet absolutely shitting on this song
Now that im not an edgy 13 year old this kind of a banger.
That’s the daughter in manifest
"This isn&#39;t a bad song at all, let&#39;s be honest, we all just hated it back in 2016 because some influencer told us to. I&#39;m ashamed to say that I was one of those people who made jokes about drinking bleach because of this song and all that, but I&#39;m glad to see he has made success early on in his life, and is continuing to be successful today."

"Okay, it&#39;s bad, but it&#39;s not <b>THAT</b> bad. I actually liked it when I was younger. And it&#39;s still kind of catchy. But not as good as it used to be, especially considering that I&#39;m now older than he was in this."
"I solved necromancy because of this song, if you turn it on in a graveyard the dead will rise to see who&#39;s the fastest to turn it off"
we all knew where we were don&#39;t lie
Any other 16 year old LeafyisHere fans when this was released? This is almost nostalgic. I feel kinda bad for mocking this kid.
This shi went platinum on musically 😂😂
I can still recite the intro lyrics - this meme came to mind last night 💀💀
Started off like Dream’s song and both are absolute garbage. What a coincidence.
life was so much better
Bro my phone crashed when I played this song. 💀
I don’t even care this song is a vibe

I ended up here because of that tiktok abt LayBankz her song called &quot;ick&quot;
2016: The Year I Graduated from High School. The thing is that this was Uploaded 3 Days after I walked Across that Stage. I remember this Day as well since I did something Fun During the 1st 3 Days as a High School Graduate.

"This has got to be the most accurate example of a bad song with a catchy beat. I mean, seriously, it sounds like a parody but isn&#39;t."
"Aw yeah, That&#39;s hot<br><br>-Plainrock124"
This goes hard I just don’t think the voice fits. Never understood the hate
IS THAT OLIVE FROM MANIFEST???
bro why do I know even the fucking opening skit by memory
the beauty and simplicity of this masterpiece of a song captivates me into a better person. I believe this song saved my life and gave me strength to overcome anything
I&#39;m sorry for what I said about you
MATTY B DUPE
"Children in Shanghai, you want job that is so so fun?"
"Jacob, I’m sorry. We all did really cringy shit when were 13, but if 59 million people read my shitty fanfic, I’d regret everything 10 years later."
Weezer
"there’s something weirdly nostalgic about this song now even with how shit it is lmao, i got reminded of its existence from someone’s story on instagram and i’m shocked to see people still have recent comments on here"
Bro took over the internet at one point 😂

This song is fire
💀😭🙏
tHIS SHIT FIRE.... on mute
"Hi, i remember being very young and hearing sweatshirt and everyone was making fun of it. I am 16 now and I randomly remembered the song and revisited it and I am alarmed by the hate comments. My little nine year old brother makes youtube videos and he has amassed a decent amount of subscribers and he receives hate comments often, and when I first saw these it made me very angry and I couldnt believe people would speak poorly of innocent kids posting content. I think he has given me a unique perspective and seeing you recently make a couple songs that I just watched that are pretty good makes me happy. You fought through whatever negative shit came at you and you kept going with your dream. All the hate comments on this video… people should feel ashamed, jesus."
Who’s here in 2023 😭
nah this fall off was crazy man
Jacob the goat stop playing
Please forgive me
This has not aged well at all....

"Jacob I’m really upset you decided to go with the crowd and hate on your own song too, it’s not cringey . I listen to it everyday making food in the kitchen and I’m 19 years old 😂 there’s people out there who love you!! And God loves you, I know you’ve been struggling and went through a lot and I know that’s so hard emotionally and mentally but I’m so glad you’re doing great and recovering, just please own it!! For yourself, and for everyone who supports you."

Who knew this song would become nostalgic

i just found this from a most disliked song list I&#39;m help I&#39;m screaming and crying and sobbing
I said things at a time it wasn&#39;t right
Dayumm this is ass 🔥
2.3M dislikes...<br><br>Harsh but maybe it was just the reference to someone else wearing his sweatshirt 🤔 😳 😅
☺☺
Unpopular opinion: this song is better than hit or miss
Damn 7 years ago.. Life was peak
I want to make things better
this is even funnier now that i&#39;m older and i know the love interest is the lesbian girl off Fresh Off the Boat
i love this musical masterpiece
How tf did he pull millie
"I can&#39;t lie definitely his worst song, but not too too bad honestly."
"While we were all hating on this song in 2016, now it’s just a nostalgic childhood memory 😭"
It’s cringe but funny and low key impressive. I like it😂
I really thought he was going to be the next Justin Bieber
Here in 2024----&gt;
KING!!! OH NO MOMS HOME!

"I hated on this song in 2016, now it gives me a sad and nostalgic feeling as I remember how good life was back then. 😢"
This shit slaps on mute
"Just randomly remembered this guy, people bullied the sh*t out back in the day calling him saggyt*ts lol, also I found my 6 years old dislike haha!"
love from australia ❤😂
I’m ur biggest fan
WAIT HE WAS 14😨
"I remember that people used to bully this guy of how cringe the music video is now looking back, it&#39;s something to reminisce on."
I actually fw dis song i think its good If you dont agree dont even reply to me cuz u wont change my opinion Ima keep listening to dis sometimez
"thank you for helping me find my 13th reason, I rlly appreciate it, and now I know I really don’t have anything to live for, you know I was having a really bad day until I found this"
my litter sister was on a wheelchair and I turned this fire song on she finally got up and turned it off what a great moment!! 🤩🤩
OH NO MOMS HOME
Cringe
the beat is actually good it’s only the vocals that ruined it
The song is not bad and I think the child has potential in the music but the lirycs are weird beacause he was too young to talk about those things.
"PS: A 14 year old was a besotted fella at school, and I started crushing since I was a kid."
"And it is like enduring a sonic torture chamber, where every note is a dagger to your eardrums, and every lyric is a slap in the face of good taste"
this song is absolutely the worst song in the world. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I don&#39;t know bout you<br>But I&#39;ll take the love songs<br>And give you the future in exchange.
I only came here for the “3rd grade looks hard” comment &amp; I can’t find it 😂
Omg &quot;and you can tell your friends well together till the end&quot; OMG NO BC I RELATE TO THOSE LYRICS HIT DIFFERENT 🤭😔
"As much hate as this song gets, I know almost all of us can remember the days when we were younger in school when all the girls would love this song and all the boys would hate it with a passion. Then we would all go home to watch vine or youtube in it’s prime 2016 era and life was good. So for those memories, I enjoy this song."
what ger?? 🤨🤨
Y’know… it’s not the best song but it’s not like I could do any better. I’ve attempted making songs and it’s really hard. 💀
"PSY - MORORING FATHER (with Jogna Learn coloring Lang and Lang, Lang and Lang, Let&#39;s) M/V 😊😊 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvxRsDpXPGo&amp;t=246"">4:06</a> PSY"
I&#39;m so glad Glee stopped before they could make a cover of this song
20 year old girl is in a 3rd grade class? dayum. those were different days.
This song came and then it completely disappeared from everyone’s mind then boom saw something on Snapchat and holy fuck
I love this song so much so slay so meow meow girl boss ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
back in the peak hate of this song me and my friend played this full blast picking up her sister from middle school. i’ve never seen an 8th grader more pissed and annoyed. pure gold sorry trin! fond memory imo
"I wouldn&#39;t dislike this because he is just a child, he is starting his life now, Im sure whoever disliked this doesn&#39;t know how to sing"

Who else watching in preparation for the connoreatspants Jacob sartorius fortnite stream.
"Bruski told me people grew up with this song and I’ve never heard of it, pluse I grew up with pac, biggie and Eminem"
Cringy
Ngl I was a hater then normal teenage boy thing man he was a beast confidence was out of this world
keep up the good work!
"i thought i was having too good of a day so i decided to watch this video. my day immediately went terrible after watching this. my grandma died of cancer, and my mom got rabies, and i crashed my car."
Chilling with her tiiieeedddd😂 anyone else getting Leafy flashbacks?
It’s funny… he made a post today about another tiktokers song called Ick being worse than sweatshirt and the comments still disagreed with him😂<br>Someone said that song describes the feeling sweatshirt gave me😭
It&#39;s been ages since I&#39;ve checked yiu put bt still your a underrated fucking legend ❤🥶🤝😊🗿🍷😀💪👏🔥🍻☺🥲
Imagine in 2023 THIS is still your greatest accomplishment
"I&#39;M SORRY, BUT THIS WAS 7 YEARS AGO? THE ABSOLUTE BANGER IS 7 YEARS OLD?  7?"
I like 😊
NAUR I used to watch this back in 6th grade in 2018 to read the comments and laugh along. Its the absolute peak of cringe but life was better back in the days when we could see the dislikes and we all laughed at him in the comment section
"I remember this like it was yesterday, I learned all the lyrics to this trash song just so the girls in my 6th grade tech ed class thought I was funny, crazy thinking the stuff you do as a kid, still play this banger at work btw, it’s trash. But a banger."
When dislikes ain&#39;t mean a thing anymore this be the result
I love how throughout this whole music video she doesn&#39;t once actually wear his sweatshirt.
This is first song l ever listening Jacob Sartorius it&#39;s his B-Day today so Happy  Birthday to him!!!!!🥳🎉🎂 09/02/23
i just want to thank you jacob because i was a afagan vet and a grenade exploded b y my feet. they managed to save my legs but i lost my hearing so my sister put this song on and it was so bad i could hear it even though im deaf.thank you for curing me!
21-7 is 14 so he was 13/14 or 12 here bc it was 2016 and its 2024 and its not 8yrs yet but 2016 was 8yrs ago

School     ❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍
Sweatshirt wtf is that
blasting this on 1.75%
I feel like there’s a very specific word/name blocked in the comment section.
To apologize to everyone and no one at the same time is a talent she definitely has.
"This is the most non-apology apology video I have ever seen. Don’t bother saying you’re sorry when you can’t even say directly what you’re sorry for, let alone name anybody who you are apologising TO. <br><br>Stop telling people to admit their ✨sins✨ when you don’t even admit your own."
I got my lick back really 🙄. Folks this is want happens when you misuse AAVE.
"This is not an apology. This is performative and self aggrandisement. Apologise to the individuals you wronged, you called one of them a talentless loser a few weeks ago, that&#39;s who you really are, and not everyone buys this rebrand. Do better."
the fact ur filtering out comments about JS says enough about how genuine this apology is
adopting a pinterest jesus girly aesthetic doesn’t erase the emotional abuse and harassment you publicly carried out against other creators. this is embarrassing.
"You forgot the most important apology, JS. I find it ironic that you show a clip from a video where you’re sitting in her apartment.  Ya know the one that she let you move into, because she was your best friend at the time… so holy art thou"
"This is not how a grown adult apologizes.  What are you sorry for? Who are you saying sorry to? What behaviors are referring to? This is performative, insincere and just as vague as any other ‘apology’ she’s ever offered anyone."
Its horrifying how easy it is for terrible people to absolve themselves by wrapping their wrongdoings in a pseudo-christian cover.
you know exactly who deserves an apology. this is such bull
This means a lot less knowing you called Rachel a loser not that long ago. You’re still mean. You still only think about yourself.
"Thank you Gabbie, i&#39;m happy to see you in a better place now &lt;3"
"Until you personally and privately reach out to RO and apologize, this will ring pretty hollow. Repentance is followed by a change in behavior, and by continuing to insist that you have nothing to say to RO, you are showing that you are the same exact person as you were four/five years ago. And I’m saying this as a Christian, like an actual Bible-reading follower of Christ. As your sister in Christ, I would really advise you to reach out to RO in a compassionate and humble way."
Women have to dress modestly? Turning to faith washes away your &quot;sins&quot;? Not believing in this bs makes you a NPC? Keep it.
"Well this was s**t. I don’t see growth, I only see using of religion as ur mullet to forgive urself and not actually work on ur mistakes and truly apologize to the people you hurt. This is y I keep not liking religion, it just allows for this continuous toxic behaviour. Jesus is looking down at u and being like 🤦🏻‍♀️"
JS.
"You constantly laughing while giving those “apologies” shows that you don’t mean it. At all. You can’t, that’s part of your problem. And the person you owe one the most is definitely J.S. It’s a shame that you aren’t able to get it."
"J.S., Rachel Oates, Trisha, Daniel, Oscarwylde, Angelika Oles, Dom DeAngelis....."
I think this is actually worse than if she had a ukulele
"You need to reflect more.... No amount of giggling and love for god will make us forget who you truly owe an apology to. You honestly haven&#39;t changed much, just packaging yourself differently."
"Apologise to the woman you tried to ruin while she was pregnant, Gabrielle."
"As someone who was a fan for a long time, this is lame as hell. &quot;I think there are people I need to apologize to.&quot; So I filmed a video and posted it instead of actually apologizing to the people."
"weren’t you just calling rachel a loser again like 10 minutes ago? what an abrupt heel turn.<br><br>Spiritual bypass: “a tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks.”"
You are not using “got my lick back” in the right way….
"This video was the equivalent to saying &quot;Dang, I&#39;m sorry guys.&quot; In a group chat then slamming your laptop closed and ignoring everyone further."
The least sincere apology I&#39;ve ever seen.
babe i think you need to stop saying get your lick back cause that’s absolutely not how it’s meant to be used 😂
what about jesse???
Real apologies aren&#39;t monetized
Its giving my pastor told me I had to make ammends to make it into heaven so here I am doing the bare minimum.
why is there so much laughing in something that is supposed to be serious??
&quot;god taught me empathy&quot; girl that was supposed to be there from the beginning lol
Yeah no I don’t like this at all. There were some good apologies to some people but jeez the people you really went after did not get the care and time they deserved with this. The pivot to religion makes me uncomfortable and it’s weird to bring that in when are apologizing to people you self admittedly traumatized. The apologies to your fans is good and probably will help them and obviously Joey accepted your apology but the amount of energy you put into tearing some of those people down is exponentially larger than the effort and time you put into the apology. <br><br>In general this feels weird. Like why are you apologizing to your family on YouTube? Do we need to hear it too? I understand the fans and maybe some former coworkers but it was weirdly personal and impersonal at the same time. Admitting you’re wrong is hard and I understand it’s probably easiest to put it all out at once but I’m just a little confused about the goal of this video as a whole? Is it for the people you’re apologizing to or for you?
"Tell me why you ranted ONCE AGAIN about R.O in your oxford interview after you apparently «reformed yourself». She’s one of the people you owe an apology to the most, but you’ll never let yourself make one to her, because you have just as little self awareness as you did before ypur long break. You’re the same as you used to be, but just wants us to THINK you’ve genuienly changed."
"&quot;sorry to anybody I hurt&quot; is such a worthless blanket apology. Then again, I&#39;m sure this wasn&#39;t posted to be genuine, it was a desperate attempt to get her abysmal view rate back up... and I guess it worked because I watched it."
"A very rough watch. You are apologizing to “everyone”? Everyone but the people who you fell out of favor with. That pride and ego are definitely still rockin. My partner and I used to like some of your music and we were looking forward to the come back, but this made it 100% worse for the few who liked you and wanted to see a change."
"That verse in James says admit your sins TO EACH OTHER. You didn&#39;t apologize personally to anyone, just in public.<br><br>Matthew 6:1 Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven."
She won&#39;t apologise to J S and R O because I guarantee she still doesn&#39;t think she did anything wrong in those situations.
"This is pathetic and insulting to your actual victims, Gabbie. You disgust me."
"God doesnt want a YT apology video, you should make it right personally. This apology is so... Vague a d insensitive. The thinky veilied God aspect to it all is just weird"
how embarrassing.
"If ur gonna apologize, try to not laugh while you do it. That’s a free tip without needing to pay management"
"J3$$ie $mil3$ more than deserves an apology. An entire video longer than this. SO many people deserve specific apologies, but her more than anyone. <br><br>I used to see myself in you Gabbie. I used to love your content. In 2019 you were my most listened to artist on Spotify. I read your poetry. I looked up to you. <br><br>The fact that you can&#39;t see that the most vile thing you ever did you did to your &quot;best friend&quot;.  The fact that you can&#39;t say her name to apologize, it&#39;s heartbreaking. <br><br>Filtering her name out of the comments is disgusting behavior. Stop hiding behind religion. <br><br>Using Jesus&#39; name in vain isn&#39;t just saying &quot;oh my God.&quot; It&#39;s also using your religion as a shield, using your humanity and sin nature as an excuse. I hope you are actually sorry and, if you are, you&#39;ll apologize publicly the way you destroyed her life publicly."
"You know who deserves an apology but you&#39;re not big enough to do so. Grow up. You were wrong. Take responsibility. You are way too old to be acting like this, it&#39;s so gross."
Girl you&#39;re missing personal apologies to a LOT of people. You know who you should have started with...
This feels EXTREMELY self serving. Like you&#39;re trying to absolve yourself but you&#39;re not really directly naming the situations or directly speaking to those who are owed the apology. Did you reach out to those people directly as well? Also this is monetized lol
"Not saying any names is not an apology nor holding yourself accountable, all it’s doing is boosting yourself.  “Look how great of a person Gabbie is” you want to say you’re this religious “have all the answers” person, when you’re still serving your own ego with this video and you refuse to see that"
Apologize to J Sm i les
"worst apology video ever. once again, gabbie hanna fails the internet 🙄"
"God cant forgive you on other people&#39;s behalf and this apology rings hollow when you have certain names blocked in the comments. It would have been insanely impressive if you could have come on here and apologized to her. Also, saying that any non-Christian is an NPC is insanely insulting."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svKhRBAkqY&amp;t=620"">10:20</a> the sudden jump, the non authenticity, you&#39;re disassociating and trying very hard to cope ... lunatic and creepy"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svKhRBAkqY&amp;t=852"">14:12</a> „and we know when people choose to not serve you that horrible things happen“ - saying that while referring to 9/11 is beyond disgusting"
So because I don’t believe in God I’m an NPC…riiiiight…
Jesse Smiles
What a non-apology. This is so nasty and the way you’re laughing through it all says so much. Gross
"This apology is BS, your acting is terrible. Everyone knows you are just going to pull the same stunts all over again when you want to release more music. You are not forgiven."
apologize to JS
"Born again Christianity can be extremely dangerous for those who  got into it from &quot;fixing&quot; themselves just by accepting christ as your savior. <br><br>This is absolutely a phase, and will pass within a few years. It&#39;s one thing to work on your relationship with God, however to boast on what a humble/apologetic person you are now because of it is not it. <br><br>Mental health and the pathways that our brains hold cannot be undone with religion. It takes actual work, and a lot of therapy from a professional. <br><br>Being born again does <b>not</b> give you a clean slate, and your emotional maturity is clearly still lacking. Do better. That doesn&#39;t mean giggling off a list of things you did in the past. You still have a lot of growing to do, and I hope your younger fans understand that."
"When an &quot;&quot;&quot;apology&quot;&quot;&quot; video starts with the youtuber not cutting off the part when they turn on the camera, you just know it&#39;s gonna be <b>gold</b>"
"Nah. Genuine apologies are specific, both in what you did wrong and the individual people they&#39;re meant for. This ain&#39;t it. Also I don&#39;t think you&#39;re using &quot;I got my lick back&quot; correctly."
APOLOGIZE TO EVERYONE PROPERLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
"Wow, being almost 40 and still having the reasoning of a 14 year old."
"This isn&#39;t genuine. This is one of those apologizes to make yourself feel better. There are people who deserve an apology by name and by event. This isn&#39;t accepted by the people you&#39;ve hurt<br><br>Also ms. Oatmeal made a video you guys should check it out because she deserves one specifically because gabbie continues to insult her, even after she&#39;s been back."
"Not this woman &quot;apologizing&quot; for stealing people&#39;s labor then immediately stealing AAVE and using it SOOOOOO wrong. <br><br>PLEASE for the love of God (yk, the one you allegedly found) learn wtf &quot;get my lick back&quot; actually means.....or don&#39;t, and just never say it again! that would actually be preferable."
That prayer at the end….was really something 😅
Why is this apology video monetized ?
“I’ve reflected and want to apologize” <b>*spends the entire video not apologizing or taking proper accountability*</b>
"Nope, this is not it"
"In about six months your will start again your manic-bullying-harrassment acts online and will once again try to tear down the people you didn&#39;t apologized to (BUT SHOULD) and some new ones i&#39;m sure. You&#39;ll never change, Gabrielle."
This is actually so pathetic
You might as well grab the ukulele if you&#39;re going to be this insincere jfc...
"Honestly i wanted to believe that you were better and that you’ve changed. But seeing the way you spoke about R in that college setting, told me everything i need to know. You don’t mean these apologies. I really had faith in you. But it seems you haven’t changed and i’m not sure that you ever will."

Gabbie coming back more unhinged than when she left was not on my bingo card
“I got my lick back” doesn’t mean what you think it means… you’re using it in the wrong context lol
"The apology that never was, what a patronising self unawareness pile of absolute crap."
"Takes a very, shall we say, interesting mind to interpret James 5:16 as &quot;Record a video apologizing to nobody in particular in the most generic of terms humanly possible, while also adding snide &#39;sorry you feel that way&#39;s for good measure.&quot; Nor do I think it meant absolving yourself of all responsibility simply by claiming you &quot;forgive everyone&quot; and with mealy-mouthed, half-hearted &quot;sorry&quot;s into the void.<br><br>Anyway, as always, Gabbie Hanna makes a video about her favourite (and only) topic: herself.  Later on in the video she says she used to be self-centered, vain and prideful, making meaningless content - which is exactly what this is.  Working &quot;like a robot: work, pay attention to me, get money&quot; - this is exactly what is still going on.<br><br>If (deliberate and/or outward) lack of self-awareness was a religion, Gabbie&#39;d be one of the patron saints."
"Rachel deserves an entire apology video to herself. The absolute VITRIOL you showed toward her was abhorrent. You were cruel on a deeply personal level. She was objective and honest. It&#39;s clear who was in the wrong there. There is treatment for narcissism, Gabbie, and being a narcissist doesn&#39;t have to make you a bad person, but it will if you don&#39;t actively work on it and you allow it to make you project all of your own faults and wrongdoings onto everyone else."
This is such a none apology. Apologise to Rachel Oats properly.
Gabbie God is way more forgiving and accepting than you can even fathom. The God you speak of sounds judgmental and condescending and sounds less like a vision of the Lord and more like a reflection of yourself.<br><br>your faith will always be lacking bc you project so much of yourself on a pedestal to worship instead of truly listening to His words and teachings of compassion and selfless care. <br><br>step outside yourself and become a member of Christ that He can be proud of
I worry that Gabbie believes she has found herself when in reality she has lost herself. Not sure if it’s some kind of trauma response or what. But all the overly religious content and intense worship of god and jesus feels forced and makes me uncomfortable. The prayer at the end was a lot… I’ve lost myself in religion as a young adult so I get it. I really am rooting for her. I’ve been a viewer for a decade and hope she can find herself and that she’s truly happy ❤️
Who else was here and watched the WHOLE damn video waiting to see if she would ever be a truly better person and apologize to J.S directly. Sad that this was such a waste of words and 0 accountability
"Using God’s name in vain is when someone calls themselves a Christian, but does not live like Christ. The people who go to church every Sunday and call themselves good people and boast about being devout Christians, but show through their actions that they actually aren’t good people, are the kinds of people who live their life in vain of God. They would use Christianity for their own personal gain materialistically and socially instead of personally or spiritually. They forget that religion and spirituality is a deeply personal journey and not a social or status symbol. A person who lives their life in the way of Christ does not judge or impose their beliefs onto others (yes, Jesus traveled and spread his message, but he did not force anyone to believe in him and his words, and he did not judge them for their beliefs or circumstances), is selfless and kind, has respect and love for all living beings, speaks the truth (not harshly, but in a kind, gentle way and without fear when you’re the only one who speaks up), is patient (slow to anger) and forgiving, and has humility— being able to put others before yourself and recognizing that you’re no more important than the person beside you. <br><br>We don’t need to see an apology video, we need to see a change in your behavior."
Where is her ukulele?
"Much like most religious people, doesn&#39;t take responsibility"
hey have you been tested for sociopathy? idk just wondering
Parading around your new affiliation w Christianity doesn&#39;t absolve u of anything btw.
"This a great start, but it&#39;s easy to apologise to people in clumps by saying, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to everyone who...&quot;<br><br>I just hope you personally reached out to the people who truly deserved an apology from you off camera."
Apologize without apologizing
9/11 prayer was crazy
"When God taught you empathy, did he show you how terribly you treated Yessi Miles and Pachel Yoates?"
"Unless you’ve started to try and personally reach out to everyone these broad apologies apply to, this is not a real apology."
"Gabbie, please try to build a life outside of the internet. I think you are your own worst enemy. You can change things for the better if you can stop being addicted to public opinion. Most of us just come onto these apps for fun/a break from reality. These apps ARE your reality. You’re still so young and I hope things will get better"
"The whole video i waited for her to say &quot;LOL, non really&quot;. And then she just prayed.<br>That&#39;s what i call talent: Apologise to everybody and insult people in the process."
Apologize to Jessica urban
Girl this isn’t how God designed apologies
It’s giving “I just met a church boy” this is the new me
Oh my god this is awful
It gives BPD
her saying “if i forgot someone…*looks up with her hands in prayer* i’m sorry” tells me EVERYTHING i need to know
"This apology is about as genuine to a certain U tuber (who’s name is clearly blocked) as Jaclyn Hill’s apology to Kalyn Nichols for stealing and destroying her career! But, go off……."
Gabbie is in her christian cult era
Too little too late
"She knows that turning to religion will shield her from responsibility. Its great that you are apologizing and I do think that should be recognized.. but the apology did not go into detail . Its not a full apology. Yet, since you are ‘turning to God’ now, you have all of these religious NPCs who will praise you and dismiss your horrible past just because you mention God. It doesnt come across as genuine. Im sure there is some real remorse and reflection there. But you have a LONG way to go. I hope you take more steps to make things right instead of absolving your ‘sins’ with religious bs."
Here we go with the born again Christian crap trope.
What?!?!? No ukulele??????? 😂
I spoke to Jesus personally and he said you are not forgiven because you&#39;re a phoney.
Gabbie the type that believes trùmp when he says they are eating cats and dogs in ohio
They could NEVER make me like you ❤
"Honey, I can forgive your past mistakes but I personally take offense at the way you choose to correlate a lack of religious practice or just the fact that not everyone is a Christian with tragedies.<br>The reason why tragedies like the holocaust, 9/11 and 10/7 happened and so on all happened because of fascists. It’s not an act of god but the men who committed these atrocities have done what they did in the name of god.<br>And when Christians are actually suffering and facing persecution, whose fault is it if not of their tormentors who are inflicting harm on christians because they’re christians?<br>Gabbie, I love you very much. Despite all that you regret, and despite all i disagree with you on, you’re still someone I will always look up to.<br>Which is why I think you’re taking it too far and your faith just seems like fanaticism at this point. Religion is not everything no matter how much you believe in it."
"See I love the growth, but the constant &quot;God here, Jesus that&quot; and saying that &quot;I was an NPC before Jesus&quot;. I&#39;m a fully functioning human being without any faith, and I&#39;m very glad that you, Gabbie, found faith and love that you needed in your life. But please also respect that there is a lot of people that aren&#39;t religious. I loved seeing the transformation you&#39;ve been going through, but IN THE WAY things were said it feels like a Jab and really disrespectful towards people that don&#39;t believe in the same thing. <br><br>I guess this is where I will take my leave. I&#39;ve loved supporting you and I know you&#39;re going to do fantastic things, but I dont feel like getting disrespected or feeling like someone makes me feel less than I am."
"You owe very specific people very specific apologies. This “apology” video is incredibly self gratifying and not about apologizing to people you hurt, but about making yourself feel better. Christians are specifically called to seek out reconciliation and forgiveness. This is not that. Hoping you extended real and personal apologies to the people you hurt behind the scenes."
You joined a cult? You went from one extreme to another. Also apologozing bc karma finally got you is embarassing.
TALKING TO GOD ABOUT 9/11!?!??!
"I mean this with all kindness. I’m happy you’re growing and acknowledging the hurt you’ve caused, but I really hope you take a moment of stillness to ask yourself why you made this video. I do hope that you’ve actually apologized to these people one on one. Additionally, if you are genuinely dealing with guilt, the best apology is changed behavior, and the very first step towards changed behavior is owning your fuck ups without any shame attached to them because you’ve forgiven yourself. <br><br>And I know this following statement may sound harsh, but I think you should step away from the internet and make your spiritual/growth journey more personal than public. Because as people have stated, this seems a little icky."
"Oop. I’m in with Oxford now, better do some half assed apology"
Have you apologised to trisha?
is this train wreck still on youtube
Why does she say &quot;got my lick back&quot; over and over when she clearly doesnt know what it means hahahaa she will never not be cringe
"We’re in a timeline where Nikocado lost the weight, Gabbie apologizes, and Mr. Beast is getting cancelled up the wazoo"
LMAO
Where&#39;s You know who&#39;s apology? This so preformative
"Apologizing to her family, she forgot to say &quot;im sorry for telling everyone i grew up EXTREMELY poor, (literally used those exact words), when i definitely did not...&quot;"
"After all the horrible lies youve said about R.O. you did not even mention her by name. Shame, I think youre beyond the point of changing"
"Flashbacks to my abusive father expecting my forgiveness cause Jesus forgives us all 💀 go and forgive yourself then, but it&#39;s up to the hurt person to decide if your apology if enough, babe"
Just needed a ukulele
Yikes
Woah. Haven&#39;t seen you since that meltdown on tiktok. I see you are still religious. Do you still believe god is talking directly too and through you? Do you still believe you are the next messiah? Genuine questions. You look better and happier now. I do hope you apologize to people privately though. Its much more meaningful.
Jess
You are not using &quot;i got my lick back&quot; correctly. Just so you know. I think you mean got revenge?
Appropriate that you posted this on 9/11 in an attempt to give previous disasters a run for their money. What an absolute joke.
Girl......delete this re record it and be genuine youre not even using the slang correctly either getting your lick back means getting revenge
Taking this with a grain of salt 🤝🏻
running to religion won&#39;t change what you did to her. how can you not even feel guilt? disgusting.
Repeating I got my lick back for everyone you’re saying sorry to is not an authentic apology
When youre so toxic you realize you should issue a mass apology to anyone who ever met you but still youre toxic so you cant muster up sincerity:
She can’t name everyone.  There’s so many this video wb 3 hrs long
s m i l e s
The fuck was this….
"God does not suddenly absolve you of your sins because you believed in him a little more, you cannot be THIS vague in your apologies, because it isn’t one.<br><br>If you believe in your god enough, i think he’ll manifest, but i hope if no one else will, your insane god does."
"“I’m sorry if you feel like I did …” that is NOT an apology. An apology without accountability is just deflection and not a legitimate apology. If you can not say in the same sentence “(Name) I’m sorry I did (x,y and z) to you and that it made you feel (negative emotion here).” You just want to save face and you’re only trying to move on for YOURSELF and not help others move on by addressing them by name, saying what you did and how it made them feel, the aftermath, both publicly and privately. My toddler apologizes more sincerely than this."
"This was not a real apology. You NAME the people you are apologizing to directly. I can see the need to apologize publicly because these dramas and clashes were public, but you should have addressed it directly to the people you hurt and the part you played in the drama."
"This is genuinely the most preformative apology I have ever seen. You have put on the clothes of Christianity, of the love of Christ, but you do not display His love or His compasion. You are a pharisee. I hope you heal, but I hope everyone you ever hurt heals first. <br>&quot;Depart from me, for I never knew you&quot;"
RO
also &quot;get my lick back&quot; means you got your revenge essentially lol I understand that you meant you learned your lesson lol
"Ummm... Two quick little things. At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svKhRBAkqY&amp;t=720"">12:00</a> asking for apologies from others when you are apologising is not the time or place. Secondly, its hard for a video to seem sincere when its got midroll adverts.<br>But! Keep growing and getting better, if Jesus is showing you the way, keep following his example and his spirit. We all stumble but he forgives us far more times than we ever forgive others."
Is this satire?
"I also want to say that if the whole entire internet had the same opinion, that you were in the wrong, and that YOU were being ab^sive and toxic towards R.O and J.S. that should be a clear sign that we’re right. There will rarely ever be a situation where the whole entire MAJORITY, out of thousands and thousands of people have the same opinion on a situation and be wrong. We all said you were in the wrong in how you treated those women, because you objectively were. Get rid of your insanely high ego and just apologize. Tell them you’re sorry. Directly."
offering up your &#39;forgiveness&#39; during an apology vid (like you expect apologies are owed to you) is WILD
I wonder how many dislikes this video has
You have not changed at all :) still as toxic as ever
This video is givinggggg.....<br>(Fill in the blank) 😂
"&#39;sorry&#39; as a youtube apology literally means nothing, your apparent &#39;growth&#39; should be shown through actions. your actions show you to not be sorry and incredibly self serving. amen."
"Yeah, pro tip: laughing obnoxiously after every &quot;apology&quot; really doesn&#39;t sell it in any way as something genuine and meaningful, it completely cheapens it and makes it meaningless. You still speak and carry yourself like a high-schooler. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svKhRBAkqY&amp;t=347"">5:47</a>-<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svKhRBAkqY&amp;t=356"">5:56</a> holy shit this is so dismissive and what an insulting and underhanded attempt at an apology. If you actually had any real integrity and guts you&#39;d be ashamed by this.<br><br>This entire video is, &quot;I treated you like shit, I used you, gossiped about you, didn&#39;t compensate you, emotionally abused and took advantage of you, and only cared about myself.....and I&#39;m sorry that you seem upset about that.&quot; There is not a single ounce of sincere remorse for doing any of these things, all you did was half-heartedly throw around vague platitudes."
"If you were sorry and had learned anything, you wouldn&#39;t be shaming women for what they wear and calling Rachel Oates dumb and uncreative in a very recent interview. While I understand mental health struggles and I hope nothing but the best for you in your healing, I very much stand with the women you harmed."
"When someone gets their &quot;lick back&quot; that means they got their revenge against someone who wronged them. It does not mean they got a taste of their medicine or learned their lesson. <i>Not being a jerk, but I would want someone to tell me if I we&#39;re unintentionally saying I&#39;d gotten my revenge against multiple people I&#39;m trying to apologize to.</i>"
Smiles
Girl... bless your heart
Smiles
girl this is just the next phase in the lineup of never looking at your real problems
"I want to support you but unfortunately a lot of hateful Christians has made me skeptical of religious people. Do you love and accept LGBTQ+ people? Do you believe being gay/being in a gay relationship is a sin? Do you believe in a woman’s right to choose? I just need to know to fully support and be happy about this, and I’m sorry about that. Many people have a “hate the sin, love the sinner” mentality and I’m not sure that’s fully accepting either. Ugh. I just want more public examples of progressive, accepting, loving Christians."
Maybe learn a lot more about the true meaning of the words humble &amp; empathy and try again. Your words are meaningless just like how you described your content.
Smiles
ugh she is not sorry AND I CANT STAND HER NEWFOUND ZEALORTY
"Why can&#39;t you apologize like real people do? Like what&#39;s the point of this, besides making you look better?"
"She knows exactly what she is doing. If this were genuine, it wouldn&#39;t be monetized. If this were genuine, she would be naming names and citing things she actually is sorry for. This is just another skin she will shed when she sees it hasn&#39;t made anyone fall back in love with her."
I&#39;m loving your &quot;woman of the Lord&quot; arc.
Im embarrassed for you.
"Manic episode 2.0, everybody grab your popcorn"
now apologize for using “got my lick back” incorrectly 😂
Stop using &quot;got my lick back&quot; when you clearly dont know what it means. So cringe
Why can’t people just be normal?
Are you gonna apologize to you know who
This was the longest 17 minutes of my life. Also if you were really sorry you would actually acknowledge all of the hurt you caused others! Name them directly and apologize sincerely.
"Laughing during an apology, reading it, not apologising to people 1 on 1 and most of all making money from it is NOT an apology!!!! Still the same old Gabbie but trying to use Christianity as a crutch."
Shoulda borrowed a ukulele and some Laura Lee crocodile tears girl 😭
2024 we love accountability
"I feel so bad for this girl. It&#39;s clear her whole life is chasing something, and trying to fill a hole. Every chapter is filling the hole with something new. Now it&#39;s the God arc. Crazy."
You sure said a whole lot without really saying much of anything at all. You’ve been consistently disappointing for quite a while now.
Girl...
Yeah.. you haven’t changed.
home girl said “if I caused you trauma… I feel you. sorry about that” <br>WHAT?????
"I am an atheist, but I do find it very beautiful and amazing what religion can do for some people. Turning to faith is anyone&#39;s decision, and im so glad she found healing and happiness through god."
Sorry if i hurt you hehe 🙏🏻 😊- Gabbie
Are we not going to approach the actually apology that you need to give to J.S. becauee to me this spews bull until you could actually do that. And even just mentioning hey like that apolgy was a personal one and i called her on emailed her personally off camera and i would totally believe this.
New addiction = god
"Somehow makes an apology to ‘everyone’ all about herself. It’s easy to throw out a general apology. <br><br>Name the people you have hurt, otherwise the apology is meaningless"
What does 9/11 have to do with your apology
"Gabbie, I say this with LOVE… you saying “I got my lick back,” throughout the video, incorrectly, is really iconic."
Still pushing that NPD I see
"Gabbie, you reading the comments on this one?"
I don&#39;t understand making apologies content.
U forgot to whip out an ukelele
This was for no one other than herself. She’s rebranded again and wants to pull the attention. Anyone who is truly selfless would not be tainted or even entertain anything to do with social media
"Oh great, now she’s singing"
"The god stuff is getting kinda tired, it would be nice if you did a video without mentioning religion"
"This is great on the surface but she clearly has not changed, if you’ve seen her new TikTok’s she’s completely flip flopping between this new narrative she’s trying to portray and between the old Gabbi with very wrong and messed up views on how the world works in her screwy little head. It’s a very lazy attempt of trying to convince people of who she is when really, she has not changed and that’s very evident with that questionable Oxford interview. You can see how bitter she STILL IS over getting negative criticism over her book. 😅 Bro get over it, not everything that comes out of your mouth is pure gold."
Is this an apology or you sidestepping accountability?
"great to see you taking accountability for your past actions and behavior. everyone is deserved of second chances, wishing you all the best in your new chapter 🤍"
Having you with us still is an incredible gift. ❤
This is unhinged 😅
yeah... it&#39;s time to unsubscribe
"We all know you wouldn&#39;t apologize unless you absolutely had to, your motives? im assuming money."
Gabbie the Bad Karma and Pillowcase music videos were so iconic :(
An apology is not making excuses and blanket statements of &quot;i&#39;m sorry to anyone I ever&quot;...... nice plug for your new righteousness oh so glad you could plug a cover.  humble sincere apologies to the person and not to the internet for views. disgusting.
scary
"Yall, she did the thing they all do when they say they&#39;re sorry, and don&#39;t mean it, she fucking monetized it. <br><br>Gross girl. Gross. Just do the apology, post it without making money on it, and move on."
"this doesn&#39;t feel genuine to me but if she&#39;s happy on the path she&#39;s on and she feels like she&#39;s moving forward with grace and humility then good for her, i hope she gets what she deserves in the end."
I’m sorry to everyone and no one at the same time. Girl
"No offense, but you should put more effort into your content, thats up to you though ! I miss your old youtube videos. :) As a long time supporter im so proud to see you doing better regardless❤️❤️"
"Yeah, probably need a better apology than that. I feel like you’re just saying it so you can say that you’ve “apologised”"
"This feels so healing. Even if they never see it, I&#39;m glad you did this."
Smile
She sounds INSANE. Now she’s just a crazy religious person.
"When people have garbage pasts and suddenly come out as a devote Christians or &quot;spiritual&quot; it always comes across as disingenuous. This IS disingenuous, I smell bull. Apologize to the people who need to be apologized to (say their names) and do not make a spectacle of it."
"Gabbie I really wanted to support you. Especially after the release of “Where did I go” - it’s such a strong song and I was so excited to see your growth. But to make this tone death apology video when the other day you were called R achel Oat es a talentless loser is so unbelievably out of touch. Gabbie it’s time to let the past go. You did bad things but you can move on. Focus on your art, leave everyone alone. But the work into your art, like your poetry but make it good. Not Instagram Rupi Kaur trash. You can do well, you prove it with your lyrics. Let’s get something out we can all be proud of."
Loved the video but the advertisements were probs not necessary
Trisha paytas????
"Is there anyone who missed the way Gabbie was? I want the story times back. I want the uncensored music back. I applaud the progress she has made, but as an agnostic atheist, I feel she pushes the Christian thing way too hard. I&#39;m sticking with her, but she&#39;s confusing me right now, and I feel conflicted.."
I can say from experience - letting go like this (whether you are apologizing or accepting apologies) brings so much peace to your soul. What a great place for you to be at in your journey ❤
at least Colleen Ballinger was sensible enough to provide shitty ukulele to soften the narc delulu vibes<br><br>You just exposed your true self to your friends in Christ.
please please please PLEASE do not delete your music. at the time that you released them I was GOING THROUGH IT and it majorly contributed to saving my life. I understand it not resonating with who you are and respect it but please 🙏 😭
"I know you’re tryin Gabbie, just be real.. let go for real"
Are you still selling shirts with the Cross on it? Because that doesn&#39;t seem right to do.
"This girl is still doing apologies😂😂, someone need to take her phone asap"
Aren&#39;t you in a bit of hot water because you tried to sell Tana&#39;s underage SR &quot;story&quot; to tabloids when you were in hot water? Washing yourself clean of sin is not this but to admit you have done that and apologize to Tana.
This is the biggest bunch of B.S. ever
"Oop. Must be a new single dropping, Gabbies starting her bs again 🙄 Christians arent stupid Gabbie, this pandering is actually quite offensive. Either apologize directly or not at all. So gross"
I actually expected to hear Jessis name... feel stupid now
"I think we’re all tired of the manic episodes and bullying you spew on the internet. You are STILL insulting and going after people, completely unprovoked, even now. Real growth would be consistent; this is just performative."
The worst apology video ever
People are gonna make so many videos lol
"if this is the right path for you &amp; it feels true to your soul, i’ll believe you. i feel that this isn’t the right path for you, the versions of you that i got to know. i could be wrong, but diving back into a topic &amp; community that already failed you once, right after experiencing some extreme pain &amp; loss of your good name just seems like you’re clutching onto anything that will help you forget what happened, or an over correction. am i wrong?"
"As soon as you say down I said “whoa, she looks amazing” and not in a “your hair looks great or your face or body”. It’s an aura you have now! You’re glowing!"
"Matthew 5:24 “first be reconciled with your brother then offer your gift at the altar.” Rachel Oates pointed out that you did not reach out to apologize, so what you are doing with this “apology” completely contradicts what you believe in. As a Christian, you should probably listen to what Jesus says. If you are claiming to be a Christian act like one and actually try to apologize to the people you’ve hurt."
THERES BABIES ON THE STREET! WAKE UP!!
I was finna watch this then I saw the comments 😂
"As someone who has ordered everything you’ve put out on look design   , I’ve personally haven’t had any issues or problems with it! I understand it’s a small company right now and I know that you are trying your best ❤😊"
Is this a BoJack Horseman parody? <br><br>...Is this a crossover episode?!
At least she is trying to apologize and she admited she is a handful thats something
nah
"Proud of you, girlie. You&#39;ve grown so much. We LOVE an accountable queen🫶"
LMAO she &#39;found god&#39; okay girl
"It’s been so beautiful to see how Christ is changing you from the inside out. 2 Corinthians 5:16- therefore if you are in Christ you are a new creation, the old is gone and the new is here!"
"Yikes. Insincere, performative and virtue signaling to the enth degree. This was not it, at all."
Gabbie this is growth im glad ur in a better place and happy now but for all the fans please don’t delete he music that is a true gift u have with ur art. Your music is amazing please don’t take it away.
yikes
"PLEASE don’t remove your old music gabbie!! music is healing for a lot of people, even if you may not stand by the subjects in those songs now you can look at it as an example of your growth to yourself. you put art into the world and people connected and resonated w it to this day, that’s beautiful and you shouldn’t let go of that 🥺 plus honestly + honestly encore are pop bibles"
Needs more ukulele
Gabby you’re doing so much better! You’re glowing💜
Gabbie is literally the only person that thinks literally GIGGLING during “apologies” is acceptable
"You seem at peace which is great to see. I hope you’re also considering giving specific, personal apologies to a few people who could really use some of that healing"
"Ew, gross."
Would you ever re-release old songs without profanity? Cause a lot of them are felt connected to and without the cursing I think is still good
"Shouldve watched Gabriel Zamora’s apology prior to this, Gabbie"
The unprompted bible belting at the end really tied this together
This is so.. misguided.
I mean there are people who deserve an apology but have her blocked everywhere and don&#39;t want to ever hear their names from her mouth. So she should apologise for specific situations without naming names or just not do that bullshit performative video at all
"Hi Gabby. I just wanted to let you know that ‘get your lick back’ is actually from African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and refers to getting one’s revenge. I am not sure this is what you mean in this context, as it seems that you are referring to karma coming back onto you."
"Hi Gabbie, I would like to say I completely understand that you’re embarrassed by some of your music. I would also like to remind you it was a time in your life that ultimately put you on the path you’re on. It also means something to your listeners, including myself. <br>For those reasons I don’t think you should delete music. 😢"
"noone enable her, she&#39;s not really sorry, she&#39;s just doing this to save face. true redemption will only come through her actions going forward, not her words in a single video"
I wasn’t expecting 9/11 to come up lol
She lives in her head
"God is good. Your testimony is a powerful one that can probably help so many. Some people call it religion, I personally call it a relationship. Many blessings on your journey. It&#39;s so good to see you in his light. Jesus is King 💗🙌🏼"
"The Holy Spirit doesn&#39;t shame, you are correct. They convict. I hope you also reach out to people like Jess separately and truly do apologize with grace and compassion and accountability. <br><br>As someone who also has issues emotionally and as a Christian, let God lead in everything, let His voice shine through before your own."
ummmm what’s going on!
APOLOGIZE TO RACHEL OATES
Queen
Part 2?! Lol because what is this.
Please don&#39;t delete your music over profanity
i disliked
Why am I crying!!! Beautiful Gabby! I’m so happy for you!
LMAOOOOO adding in the 911 prayer is so random
"I’ve been here since vine. I’m also a follower of Christ and it really fills me with joy to see your journey and vulnerability to share your experiences and mistakes and being accountable. Because yes, no one is perfect, but it’s so rare that people actually admit it. Thank you for sharing and thank you for that prayer ❤"
What if I’m a monsteeeeer
Good morning
you should apologize to rachel directly.
Gabbi Hanna found Jesus!!!! i’m so proud of how far you’ve come ❤
wow gabbie how nice of you lol
Been here from vine to now. Love ya!
You monitized an apology???? 😭
Wow there&#39;s no pleasing people.
Love when an apology video is monetized like what?!
"If she is apologetic about her creative choices, that’s her prerogative. People saying she shouldn’t apologize when she was obviously convicted about this shows a lot of disrespect, even if the intentions are good."
Speechless.
Got that Holy Spirit glow babe... so so happy that you found Christ 🤍 The fruit is evident!!!
Can you apologize for using the phrase &quot;lick back&quot; incorrectly? Its making me cringe and i am now one of your victims. Thanks.
"This is amazing Gabbie. Thank you for being willing to extend apologies to everyone. I do hope one day you’ll realize that your music and art are an expression of God, even when profane and edgy. we love all of your creative output"
"Gabbie, I thought your prayer was great. Haters gonna hate. Let them play their games. We will be happy instead. I’m really proud of you."
"The past is prologue, the future is now."
I mean honestly mad respect for keeping the comments on. Like literally they&#39;re all awful lol. I haven&#39;t watched your channel since the storytime days and I have no idea what all the drama is even about tbh
i’m here so quickly hello
Why is it always extremes with Gabbie? Everything you do doesn’t have to become your entire personality or persona. I miss old Gabbie so much
"sorry I&#39;m late... I lost all concept of time ❤️🎶 Good for you, gabbie ✨"
"The world is always looking for the next person to crucify. None of these people personally know you or your journey to God. Let the hate come. Don&#39;t worry about it Gabbie, cause at the end of the day, Jesus died for them too. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Anyone who points fingers at you, is no less of a sinner. We&#39;re all equal in the eyes of God. Whatever you attempt to do in this video is appreciated and don&#39;t look back after this. Move forward. The people who hate you today will be gone tomorrow but your name will not so soon be forgotten. God bless you ❤"
"Even with everything done or said i still love you gabs, you are transparent and that&#39;s what matters"
🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
Gabbie! It’s so encouraging to see your transformation through Christ. I’m battling with dying of the self and seeing someone like you devote yourself to Christ gives me so much hope and peace
help not u tryna come for other ppls numbers yet u can barley crack 20k views on all ur vids 😹😹😹😹😹😹
"I am and was a HUGE fan of you through thick and thin, and i am PROUD of you, you were honestly my favorite creator since i was watching Vines on my sister&#39;s phone when i was a kid. you have pushed me to pursue music, and with our views aligning with faith the exponential change you have shown, i now look up to you even more. Thank you."
you should probably not be singing a hymn in an apology
"Gabs! I’ve been here for a while now, and I love how much you have grown!  On the topic of you saying you weren’t the best role model. I just want to say even though you may not believe it, you have actually raised me through the years! I am who I am because of you! You literally made me a better person through the years! Fr!  I’ve looked up to you since I was 13! And I’m 20 in 15days,which sounds crazy tbh. I love you ! You’re doing great! I hope you’re having a wonderful day/week 😊❤"
You’re still alive? Any particular reason why?
I recently joined a church and found a home there and hadn&#39;t gone in over 20 years. and thank you for what your doing it shows alot of strength and growth. I don&#39;t comment on your stuff but I love your content the newer content for sure I love. Thank you.
If God is so powerful. He could have given you the courage to apologize name by name publicly. But you didn&#39;t. I do not think you grew.
"Also as someone who was personally affected and traumatized by 9/11, thank you for praying for us. I almost lost my dad that day but God was with him and brought him back home safely to me. I lost him to 9/11 related cancer 23 years later. March 26,2024 ❤.  Never forget 🥺"
Is she gonna pull a Brittany Dawn and turn her channel towards religion?
You were my whole childhood
Spiders. Wonder how many are in those tree choppings?
I love you! ❤
Was ricegums apology in this
This was beautiful! What a Great God He is 😢.. Thank God for saving you!!.. Thank you Jesus for dying in the cross for depraved sinners like me.. for dying to change us and make us new creatures.<br><br> It&#39;s been so moving to see your conversion in real life❤ Love from Chile
How to apologize:<br>Hey (specific name/professional) I’m sorry for doing …. (Don’t forget to include how you actually hurt them)
we’re proud of you hon
Well... at least you didn&#39;t break out a ukelele. 🤷‍♂
"You know what? I WILL be missing all my favorite videos of you that you have removed, but if it&#39;s your journey to become a better person, then I&#39;m all for it. &lt;3"
You really went off the deep end😂😂
I LOVE YOU GABBIE I WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT YOU
"Look, is this a better apology than a hell of a lot of other YouTuber apologies? Absolutely yes. But coming from someone who isn&#39;t religious, it feels insincere. If you have gone through a spiritual journey, and have had a turn in faith, good for you. If that journey taught you that you have a lot of apologies to give, great. The problem comes in mentioning that you realized you need to apologize BECAUSE you turned to Christ, rather than apologizing because you wronged people<br><br>The thing that a lot of people who are religious don&#39;t understand is that we don&#39;t subscribe to any of the same beliefs. If Jesus has forgiven you, that&#39;s fine. But just like my last point, saying that makes it feel insincere. It makes it seem like that you don&#39;t actually care if WE forgive you, because Jesus did, so we don&#39;t matter. Whether or not you want it to come across that way, mentioning religion so heavily in an apology makes it really easy for it to come across as insincere, self-actualizing, and non personal"
Truly can’t believe it was 10 years ago. I remember tweeting about your first video.
🤨
"Girl be you, no reason to feel sorry for getting work, that people only dream of. Good for you, There is a difference between doing something wrong and owning up and then there is kissing ass. I&#39;m just saying that you are a strong beautiful woman, and you should not feel ashamed of your gifts in this life."
It would be great if you name people because obviously a lot of sorry have to definitely have names in mind . But i guess this is he best we’ll get i do have to say there is now some self awareness but i feel like the next phase hopefully isn’t the born again Jesus psychosis phase if Jesus saved you great love it but don’t try to make that your whole new personality your more then that.
gabbie youve grown SO much! so proud of you! God bless you and please continue to be a vessel to help others through your music and platforms! &lt;3
oh brother ….
"This makes me so proud, we LOVE accountability ❤️"
Thegabbieshow is back and absolutely glowing⭐️✨✨🩷😊
i’m proud of you for your growth! you’re supposed to fuck up your life in your 20s lmao
"y&#39;all need to let it go and take Gabbie for what she is, flaws and everything hahah, not every content creator needs to be a saint or perfect person"
"Thank you Gabbie for your loving care. I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve found your peace.<br><br>PLEASE dont delete your songs from Amazon, i know some of them swear and such, but i really rely on some of those. Even with fowl language, your music has still done so much good, and I still need it. At least please dont until I&#39;ve jad a chance to actually buy them. I know you dont want them out there, but some of us really rely on them for comfort and/or understanding. Particularly for me, they&#39;ve helped me to process the anger inside of me, when I&#39;ve been raised to never be angry. Please let those songs live... at least until i can save the money to buy them 😅❤"
"Omg, on 9/11?? This is NOT YOUR DAY!"
"I can only comment on the parts of the apology that apply to me, but thank you, I forgive you, and I&#39;m so happy for you"
"You are aware you seriously hurt people, right?"
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Didn’t expect you to become a fundie
It&#39;s okay Gabbie girl !!
Three minutes in and this is atrocious.
"Glad to see you&#39;re doing much better, Gabbie."
I’ve never been this early
"gabbie, you look beautiful and so fucking healthy🤍"
You look like maya rudolph
Here for this! 🎉 Also: EFD is sooo real!

I love you
I love you Gabbie always wishing you the best in life 💖 feel like I’ve grown up with you and watched you evolve through the challenges of life! <br><br>You’re just always so real and true to yourself x
This was unexpected
Gabbie is one of my fav creators what a queen

Heal and let live.
hey queen

watching now-cant wait to see what this about
This is just an easy way out to say you did the right thing.... how about making a list and privately reach out to everyone you wronged.
When I watch your content it fills me with such a calmness that helps me fall asleep at night I’ve even spent some nights falling asleep to your songs.  Thank you for this new content you’re creating and I hope it brings you the happiness you deserve.
HEY QUEEN
First gabby video I’m watching in about 4 years. When I saw she had made an apology I had to come here and watch. I’m glad that shes had so much growth from the issues that happened. I hope life stays peaceful for gabby
Hi
oh jesus christ this narcissist&#39;s pulling the bullshit &quot;i&#39;m a christian&quot; redemption arc?
This is crazy cause Ik this about to be ranked in a tier list
who’s Rachel?
pause what happend now?
I
You better apologise to amberlynn Reid now for what you said to twitter . You triggered her binge monster.
Omg
"I’ve read a few comments here saying this wasn’t genuine because it wasn’t more specific and initially I agreed but when I thought about it I understand why you didn’t name names. Those people probably wouldn’t have wanted that especially if they’re still upset over certain situations. I do have two small criticisms though. Regardless of your beliefs bursting into song in the middle of an apology video probably wasn’t the best choice. The last person to use their musical talents in an apology video is still being side eyed for it. You probably should have edited out the giggles too. You were heading in the right direction. You just veered off course. As for the rest of it, it could have been worse."
every time you start to recover you fuck up. get it together
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svKhRBAkqY&amp;t=711"">11:51</a> no apology should include the words “I forgive you….”"
the YouTuber to Christian pipeline strikes again
"The self-reproaching soul (al-nafs al-lawwāmah) is something by which God (Exalted Be His Name from weakness, or associates) has sworn, in the Quran. <br>I have never heard of Hanna until this very week, so I know nothing about much which is Hanna related. <br>And I can’t, nor should I, entertain a judgment on Hanna’s whereabouts onto her journey.<br>Still, on the surface at least, as a believer in God, The Creator, The Self-Standing The Exalted (from the need for sustenance, from having to take an associate, a spouse, or progeny), I can say that some bits of her apology resonate with the practice of (Continual) Repentance in Islam.<br>Other chunks of the video, register to me, as Nurture Constructs which are to be shielded from unsolicited advice"
"I will give you another chance. I mean, who am I to judge you. I believe in giving people chances. I have so many thoughts about this video that we don’t have time for. I’ll be paying attention, I have faith in you. Health &amp; Peace"
"bro started with the sigh, i am NOT watching this <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY""></a>"
❤️❤️
"i don&#39;t doubt that you had every intention to apologize but i don&#39;t think you either needed to do this on video, instead of talking directly to the people involved, or that you could make it so random and don&#39;t say specific names or situations. i am sure the God you believe in forgives you, but he does not have a youtube account. if you&#39;re going to do this for others, do it right and do it to their faces."
Jackson Sarah Taylor George Walker Matthew
I really hope some younger 15-25 year olds find this video. It&#39;s ok to not be edgy and just be happy and yourself and not trying to fit in. ♥️
God had to teach you empathy… interesting
"Ahhhh she gonna turn into a religious bigot, lmaoooo"
Damn not losing broken girls video that was a masterpiece
Was she getting political in the prayer at the end?
i do think that u had made good points in the past though and though u did wrong there were comments made about you that werent even based in argument and about your ED that could have been not said
Love you Gabs. ❤ One of the reasons is I can relate to you in some ways. 🥹 You’ve grown so much and I’m so proud of you. ❤️❤️❤️<br>- Gabby from patreon

beautiful prayer. amen
The hell did she do?
We love you Gabbie
I LOVE that song 🥹
10 years ago today??
"Okay the singing random is amazing! That&#39;s your gift (in my opinion, which is meaningless because I don&#39;t actually know you) to bring glory to him. I recently was convicted of stewardship of your talents. Mathew 25: 14-30"

We love you gabbie
amen ❤
"I just want this to be earnest and I just want your relationship to God to also be earnest and not a hyper mania focus. Much love. Be yourself, you&#39;re loved for you not what you&#39;ve projected."
Love you so much always❤
Downtown then?
love you Gabbie &lt;3 have a blessed day mamas &lt;3 xx

Where are all her tattoos???
"Wow, fasted I’ve ever been to a video fr"
BEAUTIFUL GORGEOUS ❤
💜💜 live your best life
🤍🤍🤍
Nice growth Gab!
Oh wow I got here fasttttt
This is so inspiring. ❤
You look so much happier and I&#39;m happy for you ❤.
This is a little much it seems ur just apologizing for being a teenager. 😂😂
"I&#39;m gonna say a few things as I watch. <br><br>First off: I like that you took notes and, in my own opinion and viewpoint, took the time to really think about who you owned apologies to.<br><br>I like that you didn&#39;t name names, showing that you respect people&#39;s right to privacy and anonymity. Watchers of your channel aren&#39;t entitled to know who exactly your apologies are for. <br><br>I don&#39;t know if you have apologized in private, I can only hope that you did. It&#39;s not for me to judge. <br><br>I will say that i can tell this is rehearsed, so to some, it feels inauthentic, but again, you&#39;ve obviously put thought and care into these apologies, and some people expect some tearful emotional apology when real life isn&#39;t always like that, sometimes as humans we get smacked in the face with our bad behavior and have to realize how we messed up,  the important thing is to grow and move on. <br><br>Im glad that you have found Jesus and are in your own time making these apologies, and we as watchers of your content are allowed to go on this journey with you, we aren&#39;t entitled to any of this, but you Gabbie chose to share....<br><br>And for that, I thank you. God bless."
♥️♥️♥️
"I never liked you or your content, but as a fellow Christian, I believe you and can see that there is a change happening. To everyone judging this girl, just because someone becomes a Christian, doesn&#39;t mean that they will suddenly do everything perfectly. Yes she hasn&#39;t apologized to anyone directly, but she&#39;s acknowledging that she has done wrong to people. Past Gabbie would never say such a thing. Change takes time. I think the fact that she&#39;s aware of her past wrongs and that she needs help is progress in itself. If you don&#39;t believe that Jesus can change people, just watch. He will prove you wrong. Jesus loves you Gabbie, and forgives you. As long as you continue on this path, He will change you from the inside out!"
Just seems like she got a new therapist
❤❤❤🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🤲🏻🤲🏻🤲🏻♥️♥️♥️
Omg could we see Gabbie on the JustTrish pod?!?!?! ❤🫶❤️
so here for this !! :) love u lots
❤❤❤❤❤
"Gabbie………woah………this is fucking something. Still at the beginning so I don’t wanna speak too soon but babe I love to see this…. So much omfg. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svKhRBAkqY&amp;t=252"">4:12</a> wow.❤"
God bless you Gabbie Hannah you had me in tears you are doing Gods work now His armor is protecting you keep following Jesus 🙏 as for you others i ask this what would Jesus do? Do you ?
Firsttttttttttt✨
♥️🙏🏼
Love this❤️
a new episode... (schizoid)
"In a lot of this you&#39;re apologizing for being human. I don&#39;t want to take away the importance of holding yourself accountable in life, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair of anyone to expect humans not to post about their human day to day experiences. Whether that involved someone else or not. Perhaps you can choose to post more thoughtfully and / or choose your words more delicately, but humans are allowed to speak on experiences that impacted them."
Gabbie always wins 💯 America&#39;s Chelsea Lee Art. Stay making em seethe queen.
Im so happy for you!! I became Christian some months ago and the Lord truly transforms the heart
♥️♥️♥️
The only thing lacking here is ukulele.
❤
"Okay this is not a comment for Gabbie. This is for people who wanna talk theology. If believing in religion doesn’t make you a good person, that’s great! You’re soul is grown &amp; you’re capable of self trust, I’m happy for you :). Getting to this level means you should understand empathy, kindness, and compassion. There is no reason to hate God-believers. Christ lovers are trying to find meaning outside capitalism, which a great step towards building a world we can live &amp; love. Hate is for them to channel at sin/devil. Love is ours to spread."
So proud of you Gabbie. ❤
"I really respect the way you&#39;ve been healing and growing. As another lady with cptsd, I understand. I wish you well! 🤍✨️💜"
🐑
❤❤❤
Good for her! She seems happier and enjoying her life.
Thank you Gabby. Your words really hurt me back in the day. I’m happy to see you taking ownership
"hi gabbie! i&#39;ve been a youtube watcher since 2015, and watched you on and off since the beginning of your channel. <br>can i pop in and give my point of view of the whole thing, if that&#39;s not too much?<br>while i - and i&#39;m sure EVERYONE - appreciates SO MUCH the thought put into accepting the past mistakes and owning up to it and putting it out there, wouldn&#39;t it be much more appreciated by everyone involved if u directly attached names to the apologies? <br>u cannot apologize to someone that is faceless and nameless. everyone will wonder &#39;is it for me?&#39; and no one will truly FEEL the apology 100%. <br>while i feel u may not want to throw names out there for everyone involved, i&#39;m sure everyone involved wouldn&#39;t mind. your fans WILL wonder (because i&#39;m sure some names you&#39;ll apologize to aren&#39;t a public feud like others) and chit chat, but you can just let them wonder away for why you&#39;re apologizing to some of these people. <br>that would be my suggestion ❤<br>i&#39;m sure my comment will get lost in the sea of comments, but if it doesn&#39;t, do a new video titled: &#39;a long overdue apology (revised)&#39; and i&#39;m sure everyone will be much happier (:"
Wow. Seems like people don’t understand forgiveness like at ALL. I think this was a great and important thing to do Gabbie ♥️ May Jesus be glorified.
"Gabbie you&#39;re more beautiful than ever, inside and out."
it&#39;s wild it took religious fanaticism for gabbie to finally apologize im glad she feels healed but her version of religion reminds me of the one that gave me and my friends and family religious trauma...
This was very much needed.
No ukulele needed
I am very happy for you girly. Happy to see you in a better place and healthy mentally! ❤
I’m so glad to see you are doing better Gabbie&lt;3 wishing you nothing but the best
Omg please don&#39;t take down your music! I love it more than anything!
Sending love Gabbie. I hope you continue to heal and grow.
this is a general apology to mass amounts of people she may not have personal contact with. i’m sure gabbie has had plenty of one on one conversations where she has apologized to the people who matter
Love this Gabbie! Christ is king 👑
"I’m so stoked that your saved! I Got saved and stopped watching your videos, but then I came across you some years later and now your a Christian too! Soo cool"
Self reflection is NOT easy. Thank you for sharing 💕❤️
I am soooo proud of your growth!!! &lt;3
This is so lovely.
im so sad to lose your music. i have followed and loved your music since you released out loud. so many of your songs are so special for so many of us
Damn rewired is done 😪😪😪😪😪
"Oh my gosh, please don&#39;t completely remove your songs or music videos maybe just unlist the ones that don&#39;t align with your morals? They&#39;ve helped me so much over the years and I&#39;m sure I am not alone in that."
Amen
you were decent on vine 🤷‍♀
It’s good to see you well
i love you gabbie!
We forgive you sis 💗 God bless.
I was just thinking. How is Gabbie Hanna doing. And then I looked her up and this is fabulous.
Please come back to filming vlogs. 🎥 <br>Miss you! 🩷🖤🩷
These comments are awful! I was excepting to see such a positive comment section.<br>So happy and proud of you Gabby! 🤍
Praise the Lord for this!!
It’s really sad that you’re deleting all your old videos and some music that meant a lot to some people
I love you so much gabbie ♥️ this was so refreshing.
🎤 🐐 Preach!
i know this is irrelevant so i&#39;m sorry but you look great gabbie 😭
"I am happy that you did this. You have been through so much in your life and career. I still like the music you did in the past (from “Out Loud” up to This Time Next Year), and your current Christian stuff you’ve been putting out has been great. I can safely say that 2024 is the year of big changes for you. You’re not the same Gabbie I’ve been following from your Vine days, but you are the better Gabbie now and I am happy with it. Much love… ❤️❤️❤️"
ur mom
Gabbie I’m so happy your in a better place now and u know we are still here for u no matter what happens ❤ and we will support u keep being positive
We love a taking accountability queen❤❤ I’ve always known you’re a good person deep down 💖💞💝
Love you
Go on just Trish
this is huge of you and im proud of you.
"Gabbie, I’ve been watching your videos since I was probably 10. I’m 19 now and became a Christian 3 years ago. At 10, I would’ve never expected you to blossom into faith. At 19, I couldn’t be more thrilled for you! We may never meet in person, you may never see this, but I’m so looking forward to meeting you in Heaven ❤"
love you so much gabbie!! i recently met you at your new castle performance and it was so wonderful. i’m so happy you’ve been in a better place and am wishing you a long life of success and happiness! ❤️
❤❤❤❤❤
Proud of you Gabbie. God is good.
Hey Gabbie! I&#39;m so proud of you for how far you&#39;ve come. &lt;3 Seeing you change and grow has been such a treasure. &lt;3
Amen 🙌
Beautiful video &amp; Beautiful voice😍😍😍
"I love my look design co shirt. I knew it would take like two months to ship, and then it was a happy surprise when it came."
"Gabbie please please PLEASE don&#39;t delete your music! Your music still means so much to me and many others. They may be against your faith, but they are still yours and they have value in the eyes of your fans and god. Your journey is just as important as the destination, and seeing your change and progression is powerful. ❤"
Amazing. Keep moving up and forward. He is with us ❤ thank you for your prayers.
"You all are way too negative. She&#39;s growing. In the video she mentions being anonymous on stories but still feeling awful about it. Why the hell would she flaunt everyone&#39;s names publicly. Even doing this is vulnerable. You&#39;re upset bc she&#39;s trying to be light hearted and uplifting about the whole situation. Just bc she&#39;s not groveling and begging for forgiveness does not mean she&#39;s not sincere. It&#39;s a message to everyone she hurt that&#39;s she&#39;s sorry and she&#39;s a changed person to hopefully allow conversation in the future. With all your negativity, you should be taking the time to find the thing that allows you to want to apologize and feel more uplifting. Hers just happens to be jesus. <br><br>Gabbie i see you i see that you&#39;re trying. As someone with a personality disorder seeing someone that has those characteristics (trying to not diagnose, but had been worried about it for years now) i know it&#39;s hard but I&#39;m happy for you that you found your peace"
&lt;3 happy for you and proud of you.
Plz start a christian podcast ❤️
"Gabbie this healed my inner child. I feel very inspired to make my own apology video to everyone in my life. I’m so happy you are alive and I get to live on the same planet with you. I love you no matter what mistakes you might have made in the past, we all change, we all fuck up terrible, but we learn and do better! I love you Gabbie Hanna!❤️ Thank you for making this"
This could not have been easy! Thank you to the holy spirit for this prompting and for your obedience. &lt;3
The growth! So proud of you Gabbie❤️‍🩹
"I am so proud of you Gabbie it takes so much courage to admit your missteps and apologize, not everyone will accept it and there will be skeptics but please ignore them and stand strongly rooted on your faith knowing in your heart your genuine intentions and those that matter will see the light of Christ shine through you  🩷🙏🏻"
God bless you Gabbie!! Jesus has been doing His big one on you. I&#39;m so happy for you. God is soooo good. Blessings to you my sister in Christ!!!
"Happy to see you shining, basking in God’s Glory. Amen sister. So happy to see all of us turning to such a revelating, merciful, all-loving, and forgiving God. For He sent his begotten Son so that all who believe shall be saved. I love you Gabbie. Thank you for forgiving me as well, I was on the hate-bandwagon before I found Jesus myself and I cannot express how at peace I am after watching this video. Keep moving forward, never stop believing, stay close to those that you love, and most importantly those who love you. God Bless. See you in Paradise ❤️"

"Oh hey! :3 cool ta see another xenogender user here! I&#39;m cryptidmascgender, webcoric and foxplushicgender! :D"
I support LGBT but OMFG what is the last one 💀<br><br>Edit: pls don&#39;t start fights. If it gets out of control I will most likely delete this comment
I support anyone but I&#39;ve come to a point where this is just insane
Bro Joined a game called &quot;Find the Genders&quot; 💀💀💀💀
"<b>Guitar Riff plays</b><br><br>I wanna be the very best<br>Like no one ever was<br>To catch them is my real test<br>To train them is my cause<br>I will travel across the land<br>Searching far and wide<br>Teach Pokémon to understand<br>The power that&#39;s inside<br><br><b>Pokémon, gotta catch &#39;em all!</b>"
bro is all of the above 😭
"I understand that it’s important to be comfortable in yourself but this is too much, I attend pride fundraisers and activities (I’m lesbian) so I have a lot of experience with trans/enby ppl. Obviously I cant put myself in your shoes- I am not transgender and I’m not claiming to be but a list that size can’t be necessary. It’s inconvenient for you and it’s inconvenient for people around you but more importantly it solidifies this idea that the lgbtq+ community is over the top and not serious. It hands itself to bigots and basically says that it is, in fact, just a phase. Please be careful with videos like this and understand that I’m not telling you how to live your life I’m just concerned at this new direction that gender has taken <br>Also be careful with this comment section it’s kinda toxic and I don’t want that for you xx"
Bro trying to unlock lgbt platinum achievement 💀
Whole ass evolution 💀🙏

"I started as an allly for a while then started questioning pan or bisexual, then i thought I was lesbian and now I&#39;m bisexual and possibly aromantic"
This video would easily kill a Victorian child
What do those all mean I used too many brain cells today
I had a heart attack reading the last one (I didn’t even try to say it out loud)💀
Shes ruined 💀
No way this is not satire
fam did you just label the ingredients on a disinfectant bottle wtf 😭😭
"People complaining about the amount of genders or whatever need to get a grip oml😭 why do they care ffs, it&#39;s not even that hard to get, I took some time to read them all and learn abt them, now I know, if it makes ppl happy and does no harm then why complaining? <br><br>Most of ppl with multiple labels like these are not throwing them around in real life conversations but instead in niche online spaces, they are probably using the easiest ones when dealing with Karens and bigots and terfs and whatever 😭 Also congrats to the ppl in the comments for being straight all your life🎀 be so fr now😭<br><br>TL;DR: To ppl complaining: get a grip, it&#39;s not that deep and if it doesn&#39;t harm you or the person then it&#39;s fine and also not ur problem!!"
In year 5 I will be thinking  how they got the cars in a shopping centre 💀

This is getting out of hand HOW IS LGBTQ RELATED TO DOGS AND ANIMALS WTH? now  I support lgbtq but this is crazy.
🎶sexualities gotta catch ‘em all🎶

Look I support lgbtqia+ but you caught me off guard at the end 💀
Bro unlocked every ability💀
I can&#39;t even tell if this is a joke anymore 😭
Another wtf did i just watch moment
"mister, you went from ‘oh yea I’m gay.’ to ‘I have 82531838918373293628102 genders’ in the blink of an eye 🥲"
No hate but what does that mean at the end? LOL 😭🫶❤️🏳️‍🌈
team Jesus of Nazareth<br> 👇
Bros gender is an unsolved rubix cube 💀
10th bros collecting genders like infiny stones
Like how she becomes more depressed as she “transitions”.
&quot;Sir.. This is a McDonald&#39;s&quot;
I cannot Imagine how long that paragraph is in a legal document under the gender section.
I support lgbtq+ but the last one is so confusing
I’m Lesbian and a Demigirl
"As a trans woman I’m paying this no mind, yall not my kind but good for yall 😌"
no offense but being non binary at TWELVE is fucking insane
"Ok, I respect you and all (I’m an openly trans and aromantic person) but why do you feel the need to be so over specific with your gender? It’s just pointless now, so maybe you should simplify it. This vid is exposed to a bunch of shitty bigots, and now people will think it’s over complicated. Well done. You really don’t need to specify it that much 💀✋"
Ok im gay and i dont know half of those😅
“You may have a Porsche but I collected all the genders!”
Pick one disability 💀
This generation is fucked 💀
In fourth grade I was focused on getting out of special ed 😭
Bro got the Oxford dictionary ahh description 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Bro changed teams more times than Italy💀
0-6=straight<br>7-Heterosexual<br>8-Lesbian<br>9-Bi and pan and poly
My brain sank like the titanic on the last one💀
gotta catch em all 😭
Bro should get a world record with that many sexualitys.
WHAT ARE THESES WORDS MEAN😭
"I wanna be so very queer. Like no one ever was. To catch them is my real test, to use them is my cause. I’ll travel across the net searching far and wide. Teach myself to think that being different makes me cool! Pronouns gotta catch ‘em all! Heart so true! My identity will pull me through, I’ll teach me and I’ll show you! My pronouns!!! Gotta catch ‘em all! Gotta catch ‘em all."
IM SO CONUFSED ABOUT THE LAST ONE HELP 😭
"So, you’re every gender (and apparently other species???), but also non-binary??? I’m so confused"
"Im part of lgbtq and respectfully, dude how the hell 😭🙏 &quot;pLeaSe sIr, give me some more!!&quot; ahh moment."
“Gotta catch ‘em all”  ahh identity
"Dude I&#39;m lgbtq, i have literally never been so disappointed in this community tho. I get everyone now a days is saying. &quot;Everyone is valid!!&quot; But just no. Some simply aren&#39;t going to get respect and they deserve that"
"Bro’s got the whole collection, now lets move onto the second match 😭😭😭☠️"
This is the most weirdest s*** I ever f*<b>***</b> saw
1st grade: Girl 10th grade: ᓵ𝙹!¡|| &amp; !¡ᔑᓭℸ ̣ᒷ
"Yup, we all know as we get older we grow horns. 😂👌"
10th grade bro decided to be everything on the planet😭🙏🙏
Bro just listed the peridoc table for genders 💀💀 i googled ALL of them 💀💀💀
uhm no words.
In fifth grade I was eating glue and paper
Bro became a pokemon💀
Random person: Excuse me uhm.... creature?
Naw 💀
Look how the alphabet letters made this person catch genders like Pokémon 😢😭
"Him in 2025: Hello guys! I officially identify as a strawberry. Ik, ik, so unique and quirky.🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓"
These kinds of people act all confident and tell us not to be insecure but then they hate their body so much that they have to change their entire identity
🤮
See how all of it continuously made her unhappy.
I remember the good days when I thought this 🏳️‍🌈 was just a Rainbow flag
Who else is confuzzled👇
Jesus is the only one chain👇
Notice how there’s demon horns when she enter LGBTQ hahaha
The pentagram necklace says it all.
When people say &quot;I want to be quirky!&quot;
Satanic
Bro has the whole bible in her description 💀💀
"You know what? IF YALL THINK LOVE IS LOVE THEN HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IF YOU GET WATER FROM THE TOILET AND TRY IT AND YOU SAY ITS BAD SO YOU TRY THE GALLON AND ITS BETTER ARE THEY BOTH THE SAME AND MATCH TOGETHER? NO ABUSOLUTEY NOT, SO WATER IS WATER? OR IF YOUR TRY EATING FOOD FROM THE KITCHEN AND EAT FOOD FROM THE GARBAGE THEY STILL TASTE GOOD CAUSE FOOD IS FOOD ISNT IT? <br>👇🏻like if you agree with me"
What the hell did i just watch
"Looks like throughout the video she just gets less happier, secret message much?"
Those.........Those are a lot of............big words for.............my little brain to handle.
Bros adding animal names lol 😂
Almost fainted when i saw the last one💀
5th grade?????? shit back then i would watch cartoons and play with toys 😭
this shits weird af
"From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. I craved the strength and certainty of steel. I aspired to the purity of the blessed machine. Your kind clings to its flesh as if it will not decay and fail you. One day, the crude biomass that you call a temple will wither, and you&#39;ll beg my kind to save you. But I&#39;m already saved. For the machine is immortal. Even in death, I serve your Messiah."
"i&#39;m queer and i find this stupid<br>stop creating these labels to put yourself in boxes, just be who you are and love whoever you want to, live like a normal person"
Instead of making this you should have tried becoming closer to Jesus Christ and being cleansed by his love and becoming pure again
Bros evolving to a whole another life form at this point 💀
9th grade: alright makes sense<br>10th grade: 💀
How tf can you be :They/He/She<br>Like pick one god damnit😂
Finally found another demigirl
This trend needs to stop <br><br><br><br><br>Before you come at me I’m pansexual😭
Bro...when I was in 6th grade I played with lego instead of randomly deciding my sexuality
"What the hell this basically me saying i identity as cat,dog,rabbit,wolf,apple,banana,grape,bag, Walmart bag, Kroger bag,shelf, chicken,taco"
Bro got ‘How Did We Get Here’
"I got 3 words, abbreviated into 1. Whaddafuq."
Bro really said “gotta catch ‘em all”
1st - 5th: 😁<br>6th - 9th:😀<br>10th: 🧙‍♂️
"If the twelfth one came up, it would take up my whole phone screen😭"
bro just slammed his head against his keyboard and told everybody he identifies as that😭
bro js got the &quot;how did we get here&quot; achievement :sob:
Do you just add pronouns when you feel like it or get bored? Or when you just find one that seems cooler than what you had before?
Why do I feel like a new generation won&#39;t start now
I’m so confused rn 😢
"Blud I’m so confused, how did animals even get into this? I thought they were just species not really something you can classify as a gender?😃🙏"
Bro listed the periodic table 💀
"When i was in 5th grade i was playing pokemon , thinking about my gender ."
BLUD IS CASTING HIS FINAL SPELL 💀💀💀😭😭😭
I used to be part of the lgbtq+ community(now I’m straight)and holly cow that’s a lot of sexualities😭🤚
Bro&#39;s collecting gender titles like thanos collected the infinity stones
"Heyy, I’m trans and boyflux too!!., :3"
Bro caught them all 💀
Imagine boeing the father💀💀💀
"this generation I swear, sick to my fucking stomach"
what the actual crap was 10th grade like dang that’s all of lgbtq+ shoved into a person
i’m gay and i didn’t know what any of this meant till like last year! please stop labelling yourself especially at such a young age. ngl this is definitely because of social media
"not trying to be rude in any way, (i i’m not just saying this about you, i’m saying it in general) what happened to this society 😭"
This is kids in 2025
"She/…they? How does that work?<br>Even worse, THEY/HE/SHE! BRO’S EVERYTHING💀💀💀☠️☠️☠️👻👻👻👹"
ew
The genders just kept comin 💀💀💀
Advancement Get! How did we get here?
That escalated quickly 😂😂
The end jumpscared me . I am a lesbian but god what is that stuff
"as a lesbian, i genuinely support u for coming out as trans, but what do the other sexualities mean at the end?"
Bruh in 4th grade I was trying to figure out why some parkour guy follows my car. 💀
Ppl are so delusional these days I swear
Your whole school will hate you
"trans guy here! personally, i don&#39;t believe In xenogenders, but if that makes you happy, I&#39;m not to judge. we had a pretty similar journey!"
"Oh goddess, people in coments always so fxcking cringe, definitely more than feeling comfortable in your own body XD Don&#39;t worry, enby agender 20 yo are with you 💖"
The 10th grade is just casting a spell 💀
Eww

Bro got more chaotic through the years<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I like it <br>This is mine <br>1st doesn’t know<br>2nd doesn’t know<br>3 questioning<br>4th bi<br>5th bi and sometimes pan
Father disappointment speedrun
The amount of hate is unbelievable... I am so disgust of these comments
notice how the character j got more sad as it went on….
okay but why the fuck is everyone in the comments like “bro collected all the genders” like-
I support lgbtq+ and all but like I don’t think u can have all the fricken genders at once
&quot;its not my whole personality!!1!1&quot; also them:
“One sip of beer won’t affect my child!”<br>The child:
I just watched a human pick em all like fucking ash ketchum
Calling all straight men in 2024
My journey:<br>0-9 straight<br>10: BI<br>11: religions (straight) bc LGBT is haram
Guys I no longer identify as a girl I identify as a pillow 😂
これを読めば、あなたは嘘に反対します##
Bros sexuality is a 2017 roleplay name
I ALMOST GOT A STROKE READING THAT HELP-
"Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin&#39; I&#39;m a human<br>What I gotta do to get it through to you I&#39;m superhuman?<br>Innovative and I&#39;m made of rubber<br>So that anything you say is ricochetin&#39; off of me<br>And it&#39;ll glue to you and<br><br>I&#39;m devastating, more than ever demonstrating<br>How to give a motherfuckin&#39; audience<br>A feeling like it&#39;s levitating<br>Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting<br>For the day that they can say I fell off, they&#39;ll be celebrating<br><br>&#39;Cause I know the way to get &#39;em motivated<br>I make elevating music, you make elevator music<br>&quot;Oh, he&#39;s too mainstream.&quot;<br>Well, that&#39;s what they do when they get jealous<br>They confuse it<br>&quot;It&#39;s not hip-hop, it&#39;s pop, &quot;—&#39;cause I found a hella way to fuse it"
11th grade: fully brainwashed by mark zuckerburg to fight in the biggest war in human history
“Gotta catch em all”💀
"being bi at 11 years old is crazy, like damn i aint christian but y’all need some jesus"
You literally just proved that kids don’t know what lgbtq is and there for should not be taught it
"Sigh, this generation, is.. disgusting. I miss the times when we aren’t in 2020 yet."
your father left Fashionably late
"bro, really hard to tell them that genders are only have 2.."
I think I know someone you can help you (inhale) Jesus:)
The last one actually stressed me out😭
I’d fail as a parent if my child becomes like this
bro tried inventing a new harry potter spell
I know im gay but WHAT THE FUK? 😭
Disgusting
Are you sure we’re not the same person-
A WWII veteran viewing an Igbt parade:<br>Is that why I fought? I expected more from this generation.
“Gotta catch them all!” <br>ahh moment 💀
i know i’ll probably get hate for this but i don’t care. does anyone else think that younger kids are starting to identify as gay/trans/bi etc because of how prevalent it is in media/mainstream society? even 10 years ago it wasn’t like this. i really feel that kids are almost gaslighting themselves into believing they fit one of these categories. keep in mind it isn’t the kids’ fault- it’s our society’s fault for letting these messages reach YOUNG CHILDREN. come on.
Sin so early is crazy
wtf is a demigirl 💀 😭
nga really started collecting ts like pokemon cards 😭
if you can’t find yourself you should go to default mode💀
"this hit the wrong side of yt shorts.. anyway i support you no matter what you are, as long as you’re a good person!!"
this current young generation is weird
"Looking at the first grade and now, i felt really bad that she lost her self...😕😕"
Bro went from a perfectly normal human to a mutant 💀
Are you American?
Ignore all the people making fun of you !! Ur valid just the way you are and ur perfect ❤❤
That’s sad.. I’m sorry but your so young and you are getting exposed to that

Collecting genders is so valid tbh I love it personally

Hey mom/dad what did you collect when you were younger <br>Them: see son I collected genders💀
"With this whole new body positivity and inclusivity stuff, we are told that our body is perfect and we were made to be the best versions of ourselves, so why are we changing our sexuality, looks and voice?"
Ah hell imagine saying “no I’m not straight I’m pansexuel actually so I’m attracted to pans”
Wtf Is allat made up stuff bro 😭

Bro when I was in 5th grade and up I was throwing stuff at my friends in the middle of a silent lesson 😭🙏
Bros an alien at this point
once bro found out lgbtq existed hes collecting every gender😭🙏
It&#39;s never to late to repent. Jesus loves you
I think shes compensating for not having a...ehem...😅
Bros gender speaks gibberish

Good live cutie ……
Woah😭!?

Bros boutta get 100%🗣️🔥🔥
I&#39;m also boyflux !!
I was singing the sound and my pitch increased when i saw all kd the genders and i choked 😭
This has got to be fake😭
"This has to be satire, there&#39;s no way this person is serious."
Please repent.
❤
im lgbtq and i didnt understand all the xeno-funa-flux things imma research em tho
"I support them, but chill!, you’ve done it all!"
Notice how the outfit gets more demonic as it goes on
All I can say is…wtf 💀
I learned that I was bisexual and I was 11 years old
Gotta catch em all

Wtf
Bro trying to unlock lgbt platinum achievement 💀
I open bros bio and just see different names and hearts💀
I feel life was like heaven before we all knew about lgbtq+
The last one caught me off guard 😭😭
You have found the rare species💀😭✋️ -magiquest☝️🤓
As a lesbian nonbinary...what the fuck
"Now normally, i don&#39;t care too much. It doesn&#39;t hurt other people.<br><br>Buuuuuuut, this shit changed way too much. This is definitely coming across as just wanting attention or to confuse people. This isn&#39;t an identity anymore, it&#39;s being treated like a pair of pants or a shirt."
might be going down the pipeline
Truly a “gotta catch ‘em all” moment 🤣
The meanings of these flags! (The grey white and pink): demigirl: kinda like a mix of female and non-binary<br>(The yellow white purple and black): non-binary: no gender at all<br>(Blue blue white purple white pink pink): bigender: multiple genders<br>(Blue pink white pink blue): transgender: when a person is one gender and their biological sex does not align with their identity/gender.<br>WHA- WHAT ARE THE REST OF THOSE WHAT 😰
I support LGBTQ+ but bro really just collected genders like they were mini figures
Blud got a Bible verse in his gender 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
FINALLY NOT SOME 8 YEAR OLD SAYING THEY’RE LIKE PAN OR SMTH
"Yep, I went from ally to bi to pan to lesbian. I just wasnt ready to accept that I don&#39;t want to date a guy."
no but like I discovered what the lgbt community was when I was 9 (in year 4) because my teacher was lesbian and she was one of my most favourite teachers ever
How do I change the background to my sexuality?
May the lord fill you with his everlasting love and may he save you from the devil🙏✝️
"I remember when I went on websites and it asked for my gender, it only said  <b>Men or Female</b> CRAZY RIGHT🤯"
I understood half of those words
Nah why does this last part remind of the gray prince zote fight in hollow knight💀
How delusional
you need jesus
Speedrun any % with glitches
Go to Afghanistan i heard they accept lgbtq
This is why you don’t give knowledge of lgbtq to children
I&#39;m in 5 grade I&#39;m bisexual
I love the pipeline where it&#39;s just it starts off at one maybe two things and then you blink and it&#39;s just what happened 💕😅
Turning into a girl to a boy is not considered dumb. So if I said I became an Asexual fettuccine Alfredo would I be respected.
Soy leaniana
That’s awesome! ^v^ Happy for you. :]
this is what happens when you get graped
Delusional there is no actual other way to describe this
Never for Jewish ideology
Bro really said &quot;Gotta catch them all&quot; with all the genders he has 🙏😭
I&#39;m bi❤
"i love 2,6,7,8,10 hairstyles"
I have no idea what someof these genders are 😭 also are you trans if you gain a new gender like i just went from she/her to she/her/they/them
Bro is the true genderfluid
"as a lgbtq+ guy, they aint pokemon!!"
"It would be funny if someone made this, but their whole life it said straight"
"PIN SO PEOPLE CAN SEE<br>stop hating, your just boosting us."
If I don’t feel like a girl dose it mean I’m trans or non binary 🧐🤨
I&#39;ve watched a questioning gay show0-0<br>Help I&#39;m panicking 👁👄👁
Y’all I’m in six grade and this is me lol wth
As an LGBTQ person this is just extreme.
"At that point it aint lgbtq, its LGBTQIANFBFCGFGXGIP2SAA+ LIKE WHAT THE FUCK"
That shit&#39;s like the fucking &quot;How did we get here?&quot; Achievement bruh
This is kinda me gut I&#39;ve always been an Ally now I&#39;m bisexual questioning if I&#39;m also gender fluid
I didn&#39;t even know there was that many...😅
My god I didn’t even know lgbtq infinity stones existed until now
Leviticus 20:13 it is an abomination to the lord for only made man and women <br>REPENT FOR THE LORD IS COMING SOONER THAN YOU THINK <br>DO NOT CELEBRATE SIN

"I support you, but how does having what I think was some 4 different genders work!?"
"Me I wish I still didn&#39;t know about it cause I&#39;ve been straight, pan, bi, lesbian, and still questioning my gender preferences"
Bro done selected all of the above
I’m sorry but this is actual insanity. <br><br>Like I don’t understand why anyone would actually enjoy bogging themselves done with all these labels. Labels that at the end of the day don’t actually mean anything. What happened to the days where boys who were feminine were just feminine boys and girls who were masculine were just masculine girls/tomboys.
Awesome! Me personally I&#39;m a bisexual gender fluid! You do u man don&#39;t worry about the shitty people be you and you&#39;ll be fine :]
"How can you be Trans and Non-Binary, this has to be satire 😭"
bro’s collecting genders like pokemon 😭⁉️
"Being homosexuality is sin 1 Corinthians 6:9-20<br>New International Version<br>9 Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men[a] 10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. Repent turn to Jesus he will forgive you god bless you all god love you"
"Encountering God in the Bible is one of the most fulfilling parts of the Christian life. Learning how God loved and led the people of Israel in the Old Testament helps us to understand “salvation history.”<br>Meeting Jesus in the Gospels, and experiencing his love, mercy and compassion, is often at the heart of a person’s faith. And reading the Letters of St. Paul, and others in the early church, encourages, consoles and inspires.<br>The Bible is the treasured friend of billions of believers.<br>But for many LGBTQ Christians, the Bible can feel like the enemy. In the Book of Leviticus homosexuality is called an “abomination” (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m13e3Uydjw&amp;t=1102"">18:22</a>; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m13e3Uydjw&amp;t=1213"">20:13</a>). And although Jesus never explicitly condemns homosexuality, thought he could have (he is hard on divorce, for example), St. Paul does (1 Cor 6:9-10). The few biblical verses that address homosexuality are used against LGBTQ people over and over: in the political sphere; by religious leaders; on social media; in one-on-one encounters; and, perhaps worst of all, in homilies and sermons in the very churches where LGBTQ people seek to encounter a loving God.<br>By the same token, the Bible proscribes many laws, moral codes and ethical guidelines that modern-day Christians ignore, don’t follow or have rejected completely. For example, even though they honor the Old Testament, Christians don’t stone people who work on the Sabbath (Ex. 35:2). We don’t sell people into slavery (Ex. 21:7). And if someone curses God, we don’t execute them (Lev. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m13e3Uydjw&amp;t=1450"">24:10</a>-16). In the New Testament, St. Paul told slaves to be obedient to their masters (Eph. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m13e3Uydjw&amp;t=385"">6:25</a>-29). He also said that women should be silent in churches (1 Cor 14:34). A now-famous online response to the verses against homosexuality points out even more biblical practices that any thoughtful person would reject today. Besides, Catholics are neither literalists nor fundamentalists.<br>So one response to what are often called “clobber verses” (because people use them to “clobber” LGBTQ people) is to see them in their historical context and remember that even devout Christians shouldn’t do everything that Old Testament commands. Likewise for the Epistles in the New Testament.<br>The questions, though, remain: How can we best understand what the Bible says on homosexuality? What did these passages mean then and what do they mean today?<br>And for LGBTQ Christians, perhaps the most important question: How can we square these verses with Jesus, who reached out to those on the margins? How can LGBTQ people, their friends, families and allies, read these Bible verses?"
"This is mine:<br>1st-4th Grade: Straight<br>5th-6th Grade: Bisexual<br>7th-Now: Transgender and Gay (ftm) 💅🏽💅🏽💅🏽🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 (All I&#39;m going to mention is that I&#39;m a teenager, but I&#39;m not going to specify my age/grade)"

"What is love? (baby dont hurt me). In all seriousness though, love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy and it does not boast. True love is respecting people, being selfless and having no hatred or jealousy towards them. The ultimate example of love is when God himself put his spirit into his own creation and lived a humble life. He could&#39;ve chosen to come here and make himself known to the whole world but no, he loves us to the point where he puts our wants and needs ahead of his own, this is why God gave us free will, the ability to do whatever we want because he will never force us to do something we don&#39;t want to do. He suffered an extremely painful death, the death me and you were supposed to suffer for our sins. And on the third day, he was resurrected and will now live forever. My friends, this love is the love which Jesus was referring to when he told us to love everyone. He was not talking about the human definition of love (an intense feeling of deep affection), he was talking about the love he himself showed us. My friends, if you love Jesus copy the entirety of this comment and spread it to those who need to see this. May the Holy Spirit guide you my friends."
Listen to the haters lil bro 💀🙏
"Stunned...just stunned 🫢 I hope he&#39;s at least happy like this, but to be frank I don&#39;t get why you would have to go further than transmasc...like ok I get NB (I don&#39;t see how you combine NB with TM though) but I don&#39;t see how genderfaun, boyflux  canisgender, faunagender (it sounds like genderfaun backwards) and xenogender are supposed to help you in any way... like they don&#39;t even make sense at this point =/<br><br>Edit: I wasn&#39;t trying to offend anyone"

And here we memed bisexuals for being indecisive 😂
Bro is debating 20 people at once and still wins
And these are college students? What a waste of money.
This blonde girl thinks she is so much smarter than everyone. I feel bad for whoever ends up with her.
The black girl with the glasses is the most respectful and a rare type of college student who is open to debate without resorting to verbal abuse. She is also aware of the many fIaws within the black community. I commend her.
&quot;Do I not believe racism exists? The Democrat Party is alive and well.&quot; - Charlie Kirk
I am always so impressed with the patience Charlie has when talking to a bunch of brainwashed idiots
Unbelievable how rude and entitled our college “educated” are. They are not being prepared for real life
Basically I&#39;m seeing a bunch of kids talking from emotions instead of actual logic. &quot;Everything is subjective&quot; is probably one of the stupidest things I&#39;ve ever heard
"Remember, when you are dead, you do not know you are dead. It is only painful for others.<br>The same applies when you are stupid.”<br>― Ricky Gervais"
“As a Black woman on a college with an Apple Watch 8 on my wrist I am discriminated”
"I will say, the woman in the Malcom X shirt did seem polite and respectful, she even tried to tone down the ones throwing insults and was annoyed they were interrupting the actual positive debate going on. Nice job miss :)"
"There is no &quot;your truth&quot; and &quot;my truth&quot; there is only the truth. Everyone can have different life experiences and opinions, but just because you have a distinct opinion doesn&#39;t make it &quot;your truth&quot;. Nobody gets to own the truth."
"The young black girl listened, spoke, and was very polite and willing to have a conversation. The rest of the kids were not. I applaud her, shes going places in life ❤"
The one dude calls Charlie an idiot and then immediately has the audacity to claim that he’s being disrespectful to him. The absolute delusion.
It must be exhausting being so politically correct
"I find it interesting that people who have not come to an understanding that we are more than  flesh and blood, have difficulty defining when life begins, and the sanctity of like."
God bless Charlie for standing up to these young idiots.  Fighting the good fight and saying how every rational person feels.  I&#39;m SO SICK of hearing about these entitled folks calling themselves victims.
Everything is not subjective. There’s objective.  There’s indisputable truth.
That little blond girl is exactly what you don&#39;t want your daughter to come home as after she goes off to college.
I love how these Woke kids always tell Charlie to NOT interrupt them then they constantly interrupt him!  Hypocrites.
&quot;I do not want to hear it&quot; was the closest to honesty this loud child got
Blonde at the front had no argument other than being incredibly disrespectful. Clearly has no idea what she&#39;s talking about and regurgitates propaganda.
"Also important to be noted- that these bratty students attempting to debate Charlie, ALL stooped to name calling, because he was RIGHT, and they had no where to go but admit it, or kick and scream in tantrum essentially, by calling him names. <br>So disgraceful."
"He looks like he is talking to a bunch of kindergartens during circle time while they keep interrupting with, &quot;But my mom says....&quot;"
"After viewing numerous videos in which young college age kids speak their minds, I&#39;ve come to a very frightening conclusion: If these indoctrinated, confused college kids represent the future and hope of this country, America is in real trouble."
"The amount of energy it must take to speak truth to these young infected minds, props to you Charlie."
He&#39;s not there to change their minds now. He is planting seeds for them to think about and possibly mature in the future.
Bro said he&#39;s being disrespectful after calling him an idiot. 🤦
When a child thinks she&#39;s clever.....&quot;don&#39;t interrupt me&quot;.....then does nothing but interrupt.
It&#39;s weird how the white woman was more offended and acting more emotional compared to the black women when they were talking about race.
The truth is never subjective. It&#39;s simply the truth.
I can&#39;t help but admire his ability to stay calm and have an open and honest debate in the face of hostility. We genuinely need more people like Charlie in today&#39;s society
The blonde is just regurgitating what her professors told her    She has no idea what she is saying
The shorter lady was chill. She was respectful and wasn’t emotional. Literally everyone else was irrational and disrespectful
&quot;My truth&quot; <br>We used to call that &quot;having an opinion&quot; and not every one counts.
its stupid how these kids want to live in a past that they never experienced instead of improving the future that they are going to experience....
Amazing the blonde haired girl is such an expert on being black
"It seems the girl with the Malcom X shirt actually had an open mind and heart, I love conversations like that it was respectful and actually going some where. Thank to that girl and  Charlie"
How disrespectful those young people are to him. I’m a teacher and know that disrespect is off the charts today.
"Charlie has the patience of a saint, my head hurts just listening to these kids"
I feel bad for their parents because they are paying for this incredible ignorance
She feels like the world is a certain way. Feelings are not facts.
“don’t interrupt me!” while she’s talking over you when you’re trying to speak. She has zero respect.
They just learned more from Charlie Kirk in a few minutes than an entire semester of university.
I salute the young lady with the braids that actually tried to have a conversation and be respectful.
Don&#39;t go into traditional definitions of a &quot;soul&quot; ..they can&#39;t think in depth anyway.. just say its that consciousness she has (but didn&#39;t have at 8 months)
Repeating a question 4 times doesn&#39;t validate your opinion.
"Charlie is really good, it&#39;s not easy keeping up with these people."
The black girl in front actually had a very nice civil discussion with Charlie.  She didn&#39;t just flip out over every statement made from Charlie like the white girl did right next to her.  Good job!
Please dont interrupt me......after shes already asked the question and repeating it. And she insists on showing her ignorance and rudeness instead of walking away after embarrassing herself about the link between the black crime rate and abortion.
People do not listen to understand. They hear to respond.
"I like how her entitlement allows her to cut him off, when she was pretending to have a civil two sided conversation, to firmly say “Please don’t interrupt me.”, and then proceed to repeat the exact same sentence she has already said several times. Refusing to advance the conversation forward, and just repeat until he submits. This is how these people think. Also, according to studies, how schizophrenics think. As they also like repeating patterns of thought."
The girl in the Malcom X shirt is the brightest one in the bunch and seems to be open to real conversation.  Kudos to her.
"Charlie is EXACTLY correct on affirmative action!  I have been passed over for promotions and job positions in MANY instances because I&#39;m WHITE!  Idiots going to college haven&#39;t even entered the &quot;working&quot; word and have ZERO experience on the matter!  Try passing testing for CHP, Sheriffs Dept. and being on jobs with  longer employment time and qualifications and getting passed over for someone less qualified, just because they are of their &quot;color&quot;!   The best qualified for the job, regardless of skin color or ethnicity, should be the standard, otherwise you have safety problems and rogue authority like police that should never be police!  Being 62, I have experienced it A LOT!"
Life is going to be tough for this girl when reality crashes into her world view.
So if an unborn baby isn’t yet a human life why are people charged with two counts of homicide if they murder a pregnant woman?
The sheer level of arrogant righteousness while displaying staggering ignorance is almost beyond comprehension. This is what college indoctrination does.<br><br>Note that they are the ones calling him names also.
It makes me sad that we will have to wait so long for Charlie Kirk to be president.
"Funny how she argues against subjective truth, and then proceeds to invoke her own subjective truths"
I have to admire Charlie Kirk for putting himself out there to debate and educate.
Charlie’s a stand up guy for sure <br>Standing up to these idiots
"&quot;Thousands of decades.&quot;<br><br>She&#39;s so passionate about her argument, that she&#39;s even willing to go as far back as B.C."
For real ?<br>What is a soul? <br>This generation is LOST.
The woman in the front with the malcom x shirt was actually engaging in a civil discussion. I actually respect her in this. Dont agree with her stances but she spoke and allowed others to speak and she even told people on her side off when they were wrong.
I admire Charlie for putting up with the stupidity he faces with these indoctrinated kids!  Bravo Charlie.
The young black lady actually gave me the impression that she might even be willing to have a thoughtful and truthful discussion about the nuances of historic racial issues if not for the other exhaustingly immature and misinformed young people around her. Maybe just a couple more years on her would help but good for her. Good for you young lady. At least youre thinking about this stuff critically and even asking questions still
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=256"">4:16</a> - &quot;It&#39;s called a statistic ...&quot;<br><br>I love the crowd&#39;s realisation of Kirk&#39;s simple and logical answers"
The white girl was annoying....the black girl came in with some knowledge and was open to a discussion n willingness to learn. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
“Please don’t interrupt me” is the slogan for today’s youth.
"There is no such thing as “your truth” or “my truth”.  There is only the truth.  The truth doesn’t care about your feelings or emotions, nor is it based on those."
Each generation is becoming less intelligent than the previous generation.
"If that was my daughter, I would be so embarrassed and deeply ashamed. Spoiled brat. Disrespectful!"
its unreal how patient charlie is lmao
His patience with these insufferable brats is admirable.
Why do you have to lie about a woman almost dying?
"She really shows her intellectualism, and why we should pay off her college debt. I&#39;m glad my 21 year old son was smart enough to buy 9 acres of land instead of getting her level of education."
Heartbreaking. The near hysteria and confusion of these kids is so incredibly sad. Keep up the good work Charlie.
I love when they ask a question and then immediately follow up with &quot;Don&#39;t interrupt me&quot; when the person tries to answer it.
"Everyone rapid firing at Charlie and he takes it with openness and willingness to engage and have an actual conversation. It’s too bad that once these assholes are proven wrong, then they try to talk over him and when he takes a second to pause and collect his thoughts when asked a question, they immediately try to discredit him and tell him he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. This, ladies and gentlemen, is what bigotry truly looks like. That is a double standard. “I can spew whatever bullshit I want without any sources or facts, and that’s okay. But you have to answer our questions immediately without gathering your thoughts, or you’re lying.” Look at all the people surrounding him and look at the smug or hateful looks on their faces. They aren’t there to be taught or have an open discussion, they’re there so that they can defend their fragile egos and misguided information on political topics. I’ve never seen so many close-minded people attacking someone for stating facts. They want to jump down his throat without having any evidence or sources to backup their outlandish claims. I’m glad Charlie stands his ground and carries himself with such respect and believes in what he’s trying to do. Educate America"
First girl: “everything is subjective but there is a right or wrong” 🤡🤡
"I&#39;m &#39;Black&#39;, I&#39;m &#39;African American&#39;, racism, etc., etc. So tired of this being used to deflect from what the real issue/discussion is. So tired of everything always ending up back to racism. These young persons need to educate themselves more. Everyone is looking for a &quot;I gotcha!&quot; moment with Charlie. They&#39;re never prepared🙄"
It’s truly terrifying how poisoned  these kids minds are.
&quot;I&#39;ve noticed that everyone who is for abortion has already been born.&quot; -- Ronald Reagan
The smug looks on each of their faces despite being completely empty in the head is wild
“Why do people go to prison? Because they commit crimes” you baffled them with logic😂
Imagine being so triggered at the word &#39;Blacks&#39;....tell me again about that fragility 🤫
That blonde hair girl is super rude and dismissive! Well done charlie for answering their questions and giving them facts that must have been a hard pill to swallow for some of them! If i was those kids parents I&#39;d ask for my money back because the education system has failed to teach them something thats called &quot;facts &amp; truth&quot;
The blonde girls &quot;poor white people&quot; gets me everytime
"When the blonde girl said white man has ruled this country for thousands of decades, I think that gives you a glimpse of what level of intelligence we&#39;re dealing with here."
That girl with the X on her shirt is actually willing to have a true debate and is intelligent. She was indoctrinated and I think after this she has woken to the reality and will really start to see things better. She has great potential for the future.
There is no “your truth” or “my truth”<br><br>So sick of hearing that. The word they’re looking for is “my opinion” or “your opinion”<br><br>Truth is just Truth.
"Best thing about these videos.. these kids ignorance will be immortalized on YouTube indefinitely. Every one of them would be wise to hide the fact from their forward, that they ever spoke to Charlie Kirk in public😂"
"Whenever someone says, &quot;my truth&quot;  then it&#39;s obvious they are scared of thinking straight."
Charlie you are a BOSS! The way you can debate all of this logically and calmly is so amazing. Thank you for your service!
I went to high school in the late 90s. And we never talked about racism. We didn&#39;t talk about hating each other. Because the color of our skin. We didn&#39;t talk about racism. in society. And now it&#39;s back at full-blown. Racism&#39;s never gonna die as long as we keep bringing it up as long as skin color matters and it shouldn&#39;t matter at all.
"Obviously, it is the Karen in the middle keeping race baiting alive."
I love how the children today TRULY believe they know everything.
I want a refund on college loan forgiveness. My money was objectively wasted.
No amount of evidence would ever convince an idiot
"Makes me laugh that people refer to black people as African Americans, how many African born Americans are there in the USA? probably very few, if you&#39;re born in America then you are american, being specific about race then yes, blacks, whites, why people get so triggered by that is crazy, all these young black men aren&#39;t African, they&#39;re born in the US."
“It’s called a statistic” 🙄
The blond girl holding her hand up like shes in class has me DYING
Charlie has the best answers for these questions!!
I live vicariously through Charlie Kirk . He says everything that I wish I could say to people . <br><br>It&#39;s true what they say .... &quot; not all heroes wear capes &quot;
Charlie Kirk gets so much credit for trying to deal with these entitled children!
I applaud Kirk for being able to handle the ignorance of these young folks. I couldn&#39;t do it.
When I was in 5th grade we were way more intelligent and smarter as a age group at 11 and 12 than these kids are in college today and they are 18 to 23 or 24.<br><br>It&#39;s insane how extremely dumbed down our schools have made children in the last 15 years alone.
I&#39;m so scared for these young lost children
If a fetus is not alive then why do you have to kill it..?
I have huge respect for the girl in the Malcolm X shirt. She heard facts that she had not considered before and said the magic words: &quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; The majority of these young people would do just fine if they hadn&#39;t been brainwashed with lies for their entire lives. I would guess that most of them are not stupid. They just believe so many things that aren&#39;t true because no authority figure has ever told them anything else.
&quot;Don&#39;t interrupt me...I don&#39;t want to hear it&quot;. That&#39;s all that needs to be said.
I was waiting for the part of &quot;woman almost dies&quot; after learning what accountability is...where is that part?
She said &quot;more people going to jail for &quot;committing crimes&quot; as if thhat is a BAD THING!!!    Jail is exactly where they belong!!!
These “educated kids” are an example that feelings are being taught over facts
"I actually think there&#39;s hope for the girl in the Malcolm X shirt. She seems smart and interested in learning, though I worry that her eagerness to understand could be overshadowed by the expectations of her peers. She was certainly the most intelligent among the dissenters. I hope she learns to stop trusting the people and information she&#39;s been programmed to trust. I think she could actually go very far in life if she lets go of what she&#39;s expected to believe."
They don’t know who Thomas Sowell is 😭😩
Well done for keeping your temper with these rude ignorant children.  Thomas Sowell should be required reading.
"When someone says my truth and your truth, they have lost the argument."
The blonde isn’t listening she just wants to talk .
these babies are brainwashed
God bless you Charlie for helping this generation remove their blinders from what they&#39;ve been told and perhaps have a better vision to see the bigger picture.
The girl with the Malcom X tee is by far the brightest student there. She has the potential to have a great future.
"It&#39;s amazing that the young black lady and the Asian gentleman both quietly agreed with points Charlie raised,  and seemed to be the only ones who actually wanted to hear him out. The blond girl is going to be an angry victim for her whole life, the other two are much more likely to re-examine what he said and change their opinions as they move forward."
Double digit IQ’s all round! How Charlie keeps his cool is beyond me! Thank you for what you do Charlie! You’re awesome!
&quot;Who has the most abortions?&quot;<br>&quot;Women ...&quot; <br>Damn girl you definitely won that argument 😂
Much respect to Charlie for his tireless work with these lost children. I can&#39;t listen to these brats longer than 3 minutes.
These kids aren&#39;t evil. They are a reflection of the garbage being taught to them bt their woke professors.
Wtf are they teaching in school? Look in their eyes... the lights are off.
The worse people pretending to be the best is soooo sickening.
"The small black girl was really trying to have a discussion and prepared to listen. Fantastic. This should be repeated, there is hope."
"Charlie, THANK YOU for having the courage and strength to go into the lions den. You are making real change."
"&quot;Woman Almost Dies After Learning What Accountability Is&quot;<br>where does this happen here? watched it twice, couldn&#39;t find it.<br>Charlie has a huge number of great videos, but hyperbolic clickbait titles cheapen his presence here on youtube. He doesn&#39;t need those. He&#39;s great as he is."
"the guy on the left, trying to define affirmative action, was going to get absolutely embarrassed.  Charlie did him a huge favor by just dismissing the nonsense he was already spewing."
"I like the young black lady that talked the most. Very smart, down to earth and not brainwashed.  She listened to kirk, agreed and disagreed. Good woman"
The blonde girl is annoying. She is trying to defend something without information. exhausting.
"Imagine wearing a Malcom X shirt, but knowing absolutely Nothing about the guy. Just Wow"
These people don’t know how to not react when they disagree. They can’t answer one question. They listen to respond not to listen. They cannot have a conversation they only know how to speak over the person when they are trying to answer their question. They come with opinion and emotion and not reason and fact. Charlie Kirk is a G for being able to stay calm and hold multiple conversations at once.
The guy calls him an idiot and the proceeds to say  that he is not being respectful. What ???????????
"I really admire Mr. Kirk’s confidence, intelligence, courage, and ability to articulate his thoughts and ideas so quickly and precisely."
The truth is NOT subjective. Its absolute. By definition.
Props to the young black lady for knowing her stuff and for being open to hearing what Charlie is saying!
&quot;Who has the most abortions in America ?&quot;<br>&quot;Huh wOmeN ?&quot;<br><br>wow
"I respect the girl in the Malcolm X shirt for saying Charlie was right on a few things. That means shes open to both listen and talk, especially in that order."
"The young lady in the Malcolm x shirt was very well spoken and was able to have a great back and forth conversation. She is going places, and she truly seemed open minded. That’s the only way this conversation works. I also liked that charlie kirk said he was willing to learn and would be willing to change an opinion based on the facts he has."
These kids are so bigoted.  Our nation was so much more unified a couple decades ago.
these so called students wasting money to be waterboarded versus taking valuable classes .
How can young black college students not have heard of Thomas Sewell. He is one of the most brilliant speakers out there
"What charlie said about affirmative action lowering standards is so true. We&#39;re seeing it in action today. There is a situation in a state where black social workers were not passing the social worker test so they&#39;re talking about doing away with the test so that more black people can become social workers. That means that any standards that  you used to have to meet are no longer in place. It&#39;s honestly the worst thing that could happen to our country. I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re white and black brown, if you can&#39;t pass the preliminary test then you don&#39;t get in. It means you don&#39;t meet the qualifications or standard set."
i cant help but cry a little inside when people say &quot;my truth&quot; or &quot;your truth&quot;... those people clearly have never learned what the word truth means.  very obvious these college kids haven&#39;t done any homework.
How are these people who can barely articulate a coherent thought in these Ivy League Universities.
"The female that had blond hair and many other punks that sat around just trying to look cool and insult Charlie really made themselves look the fool, sad state in our colleges, not sure what happened, these young people need a course in common sense and decision making, attacking the speaker for giving you true information is dumb, learning is worth its weight in gold!"
The way they rely on eachother for any reaction speaks louder than their debate skills
"In 1966 I took the NYPD entrance exam at 16 years old, at the behest of my uncle who was in the NYPD,  as a fall back to college entrance.  I got a 92 on the exam but was told I had a low chance of entering the NYPD because &#39;minority&#39; applicants were given a 25 point addition to their score to help equalize past discrimination.  That meant that all minority applicants with a 68 or higher would outscore me and be hired before me. I accepted that and went on to complete a 4 year degree program."
"The level of disrespect is crazy. Our society has fallen way off. When we were their ages, we couldn&#39;t even dream of speaking to an adult in this manor without an ass whoppin."
Bro called him an idiot and then complains he was disrespectful despite not having insulted anyone once. Fallacy confirmed.
That young black lady had the most sense to have a civil discourse . Well done by both sides. We need more of these discussions amongst young people.
"&quot;Everything is subject....&quot; Okay, 1 + 1 does not equal 2. It can equal whatever we want it to at the time."
"I hate to hear a college student, especially a black woman, not know who Thomas Sowell is, though it isn&#39;t surprising that she has heard of Malcolm X"
"College students not knowing who is Thomas Sowell, is a tragedy and speaks volumes as to why we are in the current condition on campuses across the country. Not know what a soul is, is also gross."
I am only 33 years old but can say I hate this young generation. They are so rude
Blonde girl looked like her head was about to explode several times during the video when the black girl actually conceded some of Charlie’s points 🤣
"The kid on the left who said to Charlie, “Wrong, you’re an idiot…” was the idiot.  I’m so glad Charlie ignored him and just spoke to the other students."
"&quot;Of course racism still exists. The democrat party is alive and well.&quot; <br>Classic, Charlie!😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=305"">5:05</a> I love the fact that this black kid asked Kirk a question (even tho he was interrupting the conversation he had with the girl) and when he answered he pointed at him and said &quot;WRONG! You&#39;re an IDIOT!&quot; (also earlier he gave him the middle finger) and couldn&#39;t elaborate further - he just wanted to insult him - and 10 seconds later he has the audacity to say to another guy that Charlie isn&#39;t being respectful! <br>What a &quot;bright&quot; mind. Most of them are brainwashed to be idiots."
Allthe defensive posture-arms crossed in front
ITS NOT IGNORANCE  .these are evil beings.
"This guy has balls of steel,taking on the masses &#39;alone&#39; all the time."
"Charlie has an incredible amount of self control and understanding. To be able to put up with these ignorant, brainwashed, weak minded morons days on end is a strength beyond any other."
It’s sad Kirk using the word “blacks” elicited such a response from the children.
Charlie is a warrior against the war on ignorance.  I have no idea how he does it.  I wouldn&#39;t have the patience.
Kudos to the young lady who tried to engage in conversation. This is how we move forward.
First woman was doing exactly  what she was accusing him of.
"Irish and Italians were heavily discriminated in this country, where are their movements and “rights”?."
Just think how much more productive these kids lives would be if they actually spent more time studying the truth at college.
I’m not black and I know who Thomas Sowell is!  One of the most intelligent men and I love listening to him.  And that is one of the problems of the young black community that esteems Jay-Z and Lebron more than anyone.
"You can&#39;t argue with stupidity and ignorance, which they ignore 🙄"
He normally is right I’m sorry colleges failed u I got more common sense in my left pinky toe then a bunch of college grads it’s quite sad
"How is it.... You&#39;re in college, but yet you think the country you were born in was founded thousands of decades ago?!!?!"
It’s crazy for a guy that didn’t go to college can teach these kids more than their professors ever will.
This generation doesn&#39;t want to take responsibility for anything.
Arguing with a fool makes two fools.
"this guy... so calm, debates beautifully."
These kids don’t knows who Thomas Sowell  sad
"That young black girl was shockingly pleasant. She didn&#39;t belittle, didn&#39;t name call, didn&#39;t interrupt, and still got her points across. Wish more young people could be like her where even though they disagree they are open-minded in a conversation. Hopefully she continues down the same path of being patient, open-minded, and willing to learn/hear other people&#39;s point of view&#39;s. Respect to her and the way she handled herself."
I believe nothing is actually subjective everyone is equally wrong and right at the same time. Which means forgiveness must always come after action
I love that these people are paying for a degree and have zero concept of reality. <br>Our education system is failing them.
The girl with the Malcom X shirt has potential. She should leave this crowd behind.
That young ladies (Malcolm X shirt) engagement was a blessing to the conversation. Her discussion allowed everyone to hear an actual discussion and hearing Malcolm X was prolife shocked a few students.
You have to remember that he’s talking to children. Last year the kids were still in high school.
Orange shirt dude is ZONED out on that lollipop. 😂
"The girl in the Malcolm X T Shirt was very sensible and open to debate, the blonde girl thought she had loads of &quot;I Got Yur&quot; questions but just reveled her own ignorance and lack of common sense."
"Never stop doing what you’re doing, Charlie."
I realize that these young &quot;adults&quot; don&#39;t know much about the world they live in as they just haven&#39;t been alive long enough to know better ... but this group is &quot;special&quot;
The young black lady had a nice intellectual interaction but the rest was an absolute mess. They want to shout people down and there point is valid   But it’s completely invalid
“Nope don’t interrupt me I don’t want to hear it” as she states the same point she made a minute ago like a broken record.
Charlie collectively is the smartest person at that school.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=202"">3:22</a> “I feel like” that’s the issue with the arguments from a lot of these college kids. It’s always an argument based on feeling."
He said &quot;BLACKS&quot; and they lost their minds
Im not sending my kid to college
"Without even having to take a side here I can point out the huge problem this girl is having... She criticizes this man saying what makes his opinion greater than anyone else&#39;s, but then tries to assert that her opinion is greater than his. I&#39;m surprised this wasn&#39;t called out."
Its interesting how certain these college kids are about certain issues just repeating the group opinions that they have learned will be acceptable in the circles that they mix in without doing any deep thinking or research to back up their opinions it shows what a terrible job the education system is doing.
"If a doctor has to take a baby out of a woman prematurely, the baby is now considered by all sides a baby.  When is it not considered a baby?  These people that believe that its ok to abort a baby are ridiculous!  Babies are babies when God brings two people together and He forms one from them.  That&#39;s at conception.  They need to read the word."
Do ANY of these students know that &quot;their&quot; attachment country (Africa) SOLD THE WEAKEST OF THEIR PEOPLE for weapons??? If &quot;their&quot; country would not have SOLD their own people for weapons...this entire conversation would be so very different.  If it were me; I would not embrace that country and embrace America because America is their country along with the other citizens of this country.  They need a real history lesson before having these in depth discussions.
"It would be nice if a well prepared, polite, well read, intelligent student stepped up for once."
"Charlie is brilliant. He just gave these college zombies the best lesson in rational thought they&#39;ve ever had, and all for free."
"This blonde girl will someday turn 44, look around and realize that she has no real friends or a rewarding personal relationship;  but she will have 6 cats - with one of them just having vomited up the nose ring she lost the week before . . . ."
"The most intelligent young mind was shut down by her peers because they didn&#39;t have the attention span to listen to solid words being spoken. I feel like everyone in the audience was just looking for a &quot;gotcha&quot; moment where they could find offence, rather than dig deeper, which really stifles good debating."
You can tell this is the only difference of opinion these students ever hear.
"About the young black lady, wearing glasses and a Malcolm X t-shirt:  she is a little too adamant with her multiple truths assertions.  Otherwise, she has her thoughts mostly in order and appears to respond properly to view elements that make sense - logic and reason.  She is a perfect example of someone who will very likely realize one day, at an instant, that it is conservative values that align much more with her own ideas and principles, and that the liberal propaganda she has been inundated by her entire life have been from sources that work against the best interest of people like her, a black woman living in America."
Young woman in the Malcom X shirt is finding truth. Good for her. I think she understood the point here. Growth. Kudos to you for having a real conversation young lady. ❤keep pressing and being real and society will continue to move forward because of people like you.
She really piped down when he used Malcolm X&#39;s own words to counter her position.  She had no where to go after that.
“Everything is subjective.” She states as an objective truth.
"“We’re a different race so, you wouldn’t understand”, says the racist complaining about racism"
These college professors have to be held responsible and so do these leftist...
"I like this women with the braid and the glasses and Malcom X shirt. She seems like she&#39;s really having a conversation. She&#39;s willing to concede when something is true, and still holds her ground. I wish great things for her."
Do you believe back on back crime is a thing? <br><br>Do you know how many people died in Chicago 4th of July weekend? Yeah its real lol
"Charlie, your ability to handle a crowd is admirable."
"When I was a college student, I was encouraged to more listening than talking."
He’s patient and they started listening. Well done. Charlie is well-educated.
When she said you can&#39;t be racist to white people she instantly lost the conversation.
&quot;Everything is subjective&quot;....one of the biggest lies ever told. A moral shield for cowards to hide behind when they are too scared to take a stand on something .
"Thank you, Charlie Kirk for continuing to speak the truth, open dialogue, and educate these poor misinformed kids."
I&#39;m not gonna lie I got a lot of respect for that black girl with the braids who was communicating with Kirk during this video. She acknowledged facts and despite her disagreements she still kept it calm.
How can you stay cool &amp; collected in the face of so much stupidity &amp; stubbornness?
Nothing but huge respect for Mr. Kirk. ❤
"I never imagined a world where kids were not only giving their souls away, but they never believed that they had one to begin with... this is terrifying."
"This is not a conversation, they are just fishing for an opinion to get you cancelled."
"That young woman with the glasses and bleached braids offered more to the conversation than everyone else in that debate with Charlie Kirk. Man, I wish more people could have conversations like that."
listening to her talk was difficult... imagine having her as a coworker... or your HR manager... ugh
These kids have this obsession with trying to belittle anyone who disagrees with them
&quot;that you have entire movements  dedicated to your race?&quot; that shut her up real quick
"This conversation is terrifying on so many levels, you can literally hear the indoctrination coming out of their mouths."
The woman who tells Charlie that he has no right to make decisions about her life is defending the right to terminate another human being&#39;s life. Ironic doesn&#39;t even describe how contradictory her thought process is
It’s hard not to think we are doomed after watching these videos.
"The girl with the glasses in front is a good debater, she is staying calm and having  and communicating in a sensible way."
&quot;eeeeuurr its call a statistic&quot; 🙃says the women that doesn&#39;t believe in facts or truth. What is college teaching these kids?
"You can tell that blonde chick has never been told no her entire life. The young black lady, however seemed willing to learn and have a spirited debate so I commend her for that. We need more young people like that. I disagree with a decent portion of her thought process, but at least she&#39;s willing to talk about it."
That blonde girl will go far working at WalMart
"He&#39;s a good teacher, and a good man. Patience is a virtue"
Damn that white guy with the long blond hair had attitude. He also had no point. He and his brother should just stick to performing that song more than words.
17 years in law enforcement and I never arrested anyone unless I had probable cause to believe they had committed a crime. The idea that law enforcement caused the increase in crime is laughable and absurd.
That&#39;s why I don&#39;t argue opinions. I argue from a position of understanding truth.
These kids learned more from 10 minutes with Charlie than they&#39;ll learn in all their years at college. Keep up the deprogramming!
Ok so one gal seems to think its bad the crooks get caught like the crime didnt happen if they dont get caught ....doofus smh
What a VERY patient person you are Charlie. I applaud you.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=232"">3:52</a> I actually applaud her for admitting that.  You can see it on her face as it slowly dawns on her.  She has been so used to never having someone question her about the talking points, when someone finally did, she paused and you can see for a moment, she thought about it and had no rebuttal! 😀"
Is murder wrong?<br>&quot;Not in every case.&quot; <br><br>WTF? Does she not know what murder is???
Charlie should get a medal for putting up with this stupidity on a volunteer basis 😂.
This black girl is smart and intelligent. Willing to have a grown up debate. Good on her👏👏👏
There&#39;s no &quot;my truth.&quot; There&#39;s only personal experience and interpretation of that experience.
"@Charlie Kirk  I appreciate you going to college campuses to have these kind of discussions.  You handle yourself so well, with these students!  <br>You show that you sincerely care about these students.  You listen patiently and respectfully.  ❤"
I wish I was a teenager again. They know SO much more than everyone else.🙄
"I find it interesting that when you engage a group of people of that age you&#39;re actually engaging what they have been taught by their upbringing and you can tell how little they have done as independent agents of their own lives.<br><br>When you think about it, it&#39;s a difficult task for anyone to engage that audience regardless of their reason or logic."
I&#39;d love to know how these young women would console each other if they miscarried a baby that they wanted. I guarantee they won&#39;t be so flippant if they&#39;re unfortunate enough to lose a much wanted baby.
I’ve been convinced one of the first things college students learn is how to be extremely smug and repulsively rude in their ignorance.
This is way this country is in trouble so out of touch with reality.
I love this interaction because no one flipped out and the students kept talking rather than walk away pissed off. Great job to Charlie Kirk and these young people!
Young people no experience in life.
"That girl was debating, but she was being very respectful in general of trying to debate rather than argue random stuff."
It’s funny how once kids get out of high school and aren’t living with mommy and daddy anymore and are now living out on their own while still not having to pay bills think they know everything about the world 😂
the PATIENCE Charlie has is amazing.  It&#39;s so difficult to rationalize with irrational people
Every one of them immediately tried to belittle Charlie and call him an idiot every time they brought up their point they wanted to talk about.  I don&#39;t know how he remains so calm and collected in situations like that.
I respect anyone who can remain patient like this.
Amazing how the more ignorant these students are the more rude they are.
i have listened to 1 minutes and 19 seconds of this and her self-contradiction is already causing me physical pain. you are a saint charlie.
Excellent work once again Charlie!! Thank you for telling the facts to these under educated kids
"And just like Flat Earthers, they are asking really great questions but they don&#39;t want to hear the answer. They think that the question itself is an argument."
The sass when they think they are right is the funniest shit ever
I think it’s awesome these kids warmed up to you enough to have constructive discussion
"“Why do people go to prison, they commit crimes.”"
Charlie you got big balls dealing with this generation. Keep teaching them.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=243"">4:03</a> what os she on about? Does she not think white people can experience racism?"
we gotta respect the girl w the M.X. shirt. she was one of VERY few ppl who actually admitted it when charlie was right
The biggest decision these kids have daily is whst they are having for lunch
Justice to the guy who was raising his hand patiently the whole time even AFTER you called on him and he started to talk. These entitled people in the front wanted all the attention.
How do you go to college and end up being dumber?
"College students are just exhausting man. I remember thinking I knew everything in my early 20&#39;s too, but we are reaching new heights.  I grew up in California and every single teacher/professor was extremely liberal, and had no problem letting their political views seep into the classroom. They don&#39;t even realize they are being brainwashed. You have to grow out of it."
"Just because its YOUR truth from YOUR beliefs, doesn`t mean its THE truth.<br>A LOT of people need to understand this."
Kudos to the girl in the Malcolm X shirt. She was willing to have an open and civilized discussion with Charlie and to listen instead of just screaming at him. Well done to her.
Charlie I have to give it to you for standing up to these young people. Kudos to you.
Imagine calling someone who is 100x smarter than you an idiot.. lol.. these kids live in a fantasy world of make believe lol.. astonishing.
Cheers to the young black woman for keeping her composure in a debatable topic. Cheers to her and her attitude
Charlie Kirk you saved my life. God bless you.
Takes a lot of courage to do what Charlie is doing....and love for these young people.  Praying for you Charlie!
"These kids have no clue that adult conservatives once held the exact views and passions they have now. As you live, experience, and gain wisdom you realize how ignorant, uneducated, and trapped in a bubble you have to be to speak pretending you know what you&#39;re talking about."
Are these people seriously expecting to be employable when they finish college?
It&#39;s always amazing to me how those with minimal REAL LIFE experience always think they know more than those who have actually lived REAL LIFE for many decades.
"The real question is, why does she believe that her morals go above everybody else’s morals?<br><br>After all, if everything is subjective, then what makes you right <br><br>Why just because"
"Total respect for Malcom X chic trying to have an intelligent, productive conversation. 👍"
I&#39;m losing faith in the intelligence of our youth in this nation!!
I can prove an unborn child has feelings and thinks. As a fire fighter for 40 years I had a woman that was in an accident and had most her head crushed. She was 8 months pregnant and if you saw how hard that baby fought to survive you would know that it’s alive! Unfortunately the baby died before we got her out of the car.
“There is no such thing as objective or absolute truth” is an objective statement of absolute truth and a paradox.
"As a Gen X&#39;er the rampant racism on campuses makes me angry, sad &amp; sick.<br>CRT/identity politics is poison."
Says “your an idiot” then says  Charley is disrespectful
"You are amazing with those kids, Charlie! I’m a retired high school teacher who really misses that interaction. You’re a good listener who allows them to speak and make their points, after which you set them straight! And I see some of the kids give you their sign of approval when you do that. We need more caring adults like you out there!"
God Bless you Charlie. I wish he was in charge of our educational system. You can learn a lot more in 5 minutes of talking to Charlie then you can after a year at certain schools.
All stuff aside I give Charlie mad credit for being brave and Patient enough to endure crowds like this month after month
Christ loves YOU and died for YOU on that cross🙏✝️
Charlie’s patience level is incredible. 😂😂
"And soon as they go the &quot;please don&#39;t interrupt me&quot; route, you know they have already lost"
Excellent
"Bruh, the black girl was trying to have a conversation while the white girl was trying to look good."
Car crash example an EXCELLENT way to debunk the &quot;personal truth&quot; trumping objective truth argument
They&#39;ve been failed by their educators.
"It’s not about what you feel, it’s about what is FACTS"
"He should have followed up with, &quot;is it a person an hour before they&#39;re born&quot;?"
His patience is a super power
Nobody thinks they are just &quot;right&quot; without any reasoning behind it.  Charlie Kirk gives--supporting reasons--behind every opinion that he makes.
He uses logic and facts based off of history and biology
Someone needs to red flag the girl who said murder isn’t wrong in every case. Put her on the FBI watchlist. 😂
Most of them have no clue. They follow the leader blindly
I love how KIDS with no life experience have it all figured out. The older I get the more I realize how much I don&#39;t know.
"Arguing with college age adults is just like arguing with pre teen kids. They KNOW everything, and you know nothing. As a parent of a 23 year old i have learned soooooooooo much from him..............."
Some of these kids are just educated incorrectly. Taught untrue “facts”.
"i know these are just children, but the fact they don&#39;t know who Tomas Sowell is, is astounding"
God bless you Charlie! These kids are intolerable and yet you patiently carry on the discussion
They don’t let him speak because they know he’s right
I look at it this way…if you were able to break thru to at least one of them it’s worth it. You at least educated them with real knowledge and understanding. I appreciate and admire your effort and your patriotism for our great nation. Thank you 🙏
Dude ..big props..this guy has the balls to go and site and debate/educate over and over
"Charlie is not only proactively educational but bold as dogs balls, one of these reactionary liberal sociopaths is going to present a real and present threat to his safety.  Legend"
This girl tried really hard to create an argument. I appreciate her effort.
There IS objective truth—it drives me nuts when people pretend otherwise
She wants to tell him what he thinks and wont allow him to interrupt... the hypocrisy of narcissism knows no end.
This younger generation scares the heck out of me. They think they are know-it-alls when they have barely started adulthood and lived life yet. Keep proving them wrong with the correct information and I can only pray they will one day be humbled.
They don’t believe in “souls” because they don’t possess one themselves!!!!!!
"Bravo to the young lady participating in a conversation with Charlie. I&#39;m sure because of her open mind, others learned something that day."
"Unreal, this was by far the WORST group of college kids I have ever seen Charlie have to deal with. Their lack of respect is simply disgusting, let alone their complete hypocrisy &amp; ignorance, and yet ALL these ENTITLED children preach about is how unfair the world is to them, at fvckin 18-22 years old IN COLLEGE. It&#39;s insane how much energy they put into playing the victim, that could be used so much more productively. Just further proof to exactly why America is going backwards."
"So sad, these kids have no idea what life really is, the fact that they don’t know when life starts, is mesmerizing!"
&quot;Professors&quot; need to be held accountable.
I think it’s amazing that they can have this dialogue. Props to all the kids who stood up and engaged with Charlie.  Debate is not hate.  Let’s keep this going.
Charlie is doing such a worthy job!❤
"Wearing a mask outside in 95% heat unfortunately shows how controlled many kids are,brainwashed by evil unfortunately.🙏"
"These are so hard for me to watch. I was raised to be respectful to others and intentional, continued disrespect was always handled swiftly and harshly and I carry that teaching with me to this day. He is absolutely built for this. Such a patient and humble man."
God bless you Charlie. Your patience when you are being rudely interrupted is stellar. True gentleman.
"Honestly,  I am sick of college girls talking so much."
1st year of college and these kids think they know everything and are self righteous
I remember being an undergrad student 12 yeara ago and having proper debates. How the times have changed.
He was right about everything I’m really impressed
"Charlie you have the energy, patience and calming, thank you 🙏🙏"
They need Candace Owens!
"Ive seen worse scrums but Charlie does such a good job of not escalating already hot and unstable passion and temperature. Hes a class act and very talented at what he does. Not to mention, brave. Respect, Mr Kirk ❤"
"The patience of Charlie Kirk is legendary.........listening to and debating, calmly,patiently and respectfully to societies most ignorant and ideologically brainwashed nihilists who dont even think they have a soul.  This is work that Christ himself could respect."
"The fact that she said &quot;Don&#39;t interrupt me, I don&#39;t want to hear it...&quot; says she was not prepared for an argument.  When will people start doing research and educate themselves before trying to debate political topics?"
Accountability is a bad word to liberals.
These kids are off their rockers. Great job parents! You should be sooooooo proud.
"I love seeing the longer version vids.  I’ve gotta give it to these kids for b n respectful, using their minds and listening. Charlie, you’re doing a great job by opening up the conversation, making kids use their brains and teaching them. You’re keeping their attn. Better than what most professors do. I applaud u! 👏👏"
&quot;Do not argue with a fool. He will drag you down to his level and beat you with experience.&quot;
If I were the parent of any of the students I would think I wasted my money sending them to college.
The most important thing these kids learned is that we are entitled our own opinions but not our own set of facts. There can ultimately be only 1 truth and that’s THE truth.
I am losing hope for today&#39;s youth.
Have they been educated ?<br><br>Or indoctrinated ?
You lost me at “Soul” brother… What’s a SOUL? 😂
She doesn’t know who Thomas Sowell is?!?!?! FFS 🤦🏻‍♂️
"&quot;But no, you&#39;re wrong, because I think that&#39;s right, and you think that&#39;s right&quot; Truly one of the most amazing and beautiful and intelligent and inspired quotes of all time"
"Truth, by its very definition, is objective. Once you introduce subjectivity into truth, it becomes perspective."
quit school at work at fast food
"The biggest issue here is that all of a sudden this entire crowd starts having way too many different arguments at the same time.  ...The dude is playing whack a mole, and that is not a discussion.  I also noticed the girl said, &quot;Don&#39;t interrupt me&quot;... because I want to say again, the exact same sentence I already said to you twice before. These people don&#39;t even hear &#39;themselves&#39;; inside their own minds, when they blabber, so how can we expect them to understand and accept LOGIC."
The stupidity of these students&#39; reasoning is incredible.
"I love this guy!! He never gets mad or upset, anyone who gets worked up he calms them down. He makes everyone comfortable"
Some people love to here themselves talk
"One unsung hero in this scene is the dude in the orange t-shirt and some of those holding conversations behind the scenes. As for the young woman in the Malcolm X shirt, she appears to have lived a sheltered life within a silo but definitely has got sense, respect, and the ability to reason through her newfound findings."
I would definitely watch an extended conversation between Charlie and the young woman in the Malcom X tshirt.  Two people who were able to keep emotion out of their debate which can inflame a lot of people.  Sign her up Charlie!
The TRUTH is NOT subjective. Period.
"she has to be high, its the only thing that makes sense about her body language"
"It&#39;s so frustrating that these, basically children have been empowered by their teachers, precession and society to believe they are the authority of knowledge when they haven&#39;t even lived in the real world yet."
He’s so good at what he does it’s crazy!
The question should be “what perpetuates racism?”
It’s nice watching the youths today get educated 😂
I appreciate that these students went from screaming and hollering to then listening
They tried to 6v1 him and talk over him and still managed to get absolutely crushed.
Charlie you’re a boss. I love that you have the courage to face the wokes in their face
Interrupts <br><br><b>Dnt interrupt me</b>
God bless Charlie Kirk for opening the eyes of the few that listen.
"I just love that you’re facilitating these types of conversations. It’s critical to exchange opinions and engage in debate—that’s how we reach legitimate conclusions.<br>What you’re doing is so important, thank you."
"This man has the patience of a saint. And due to this, he might actually get through to these kids."
Girl says don&#39;t interrupt me. Then interrupts everybody else.
Thank you for being so patient with these young people who have been trained to see every issue as oppressor and oppressed.
"‘Is murder wrong?’ <br><br>‘Yes, of course.’<br><br>Ma’am, you just stated a subjective opinion. If everything is subjective, there is no morality. There is no right or wrong.<br><br>Man I miss when our culture imbued basic moral philosophy. These kids are unbelievably confused and it’s not their fault, 1,000 opinions, 90% of them unsussed logic in every song, show, tik tok, peer and too many adults."
Short girl is there to learn other side. Blonde girl is there to win.
University of Texas in Austin of course it&#39;s Austin the California of Texas
"if a fetus is not a human, then why does a person get charged with a double homicide for killing a pregnant woman."
"Thank you, Charlie. You gave the naive college kids the right wake up call! They are smart, but do need to analyze more before open their mouth."
"I&#39;m not a pro-lifer, but it disturbs me how smug, lazy, and irrational some of my fellow pro-choicers can be. They enter into these debates with zero preparation and then get mad when they can&#39;t defend themselves."
A wise man once said: &quot;The biggest mistake humanity has ever made was to use science as a means to justify the division and classification of humanity based on race. ...&quot;
"one of the best discussions ever. no screaming, blaming... just a conversation."
Trying to educate ignorant people is just about pointless. I give this guy soooooo much credit for even trying to have these conversations with people who are anti-facts.
&quot;I don&#39;t believe in souls&quot; <br>So what are you fighting for? Who are you fighting for? Why should anything matter? It&#39;s just cells and matter.
Great Job Charlie -  so important discussions
And these people are going to be the future of America???! OMG
As soon as she said &quot;militarization of police&quot; she instantly lost all little intelligence she had left.
How does he stay so calm?  He is amazing that he talks to them as if they are equals when it is painfully clear that all they can do is spout pompous nonsense.
"i see 6 demons against a normal ,moral guy named charlie"
"I liked the young lady with the glasses. She was very respectful, very articulate. Everybody else was feeding off emotions with nothing much to say a value. Very good conversation between you and her."
"I so appreciate the young woman in the Malcolm X tshirt. She engaged in actual conversation,  didn&#39;t hurl nasty insults of she disagreed❤, and she made some decent points. I was definitely interested in hearing her thoughts. Well done. Great job as always, Charlie."
Girl between the age of 18 - 21 in college wearing a Malcom X shirt.  His movement was 40+ years before she was even born and she&#39;s going to act like she was &quot;in it&quot; with a solid grasp back in the early 1960&#39;s.  I can tell what kind of angry parents raised her.
Where’s part two
Poisoned brains
Horns down
Blonde girl is not eating it she pmo the entire video wanting to be in then mix so bad lol
Eternity is only in Christ…the soul is not eternal without Christ.
&quot;I think of a man.  And I take away reason and accountability.&quot;
They are eating the cats and dogs
"Objective is directive aka priority, it doesn&#39;t mean &quot;unquestionably true&quot; like you mouth-breathers pretend it means.<br>Objectives ate real but objective vs subjective is false dichotomy, the mind is fibite aka flawed or quantifisble not &quot;objective&quot; as in &quot;absolute&quot; but objective as in &quot;targets desired direction of progress.&quot;"
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=232"">3:52</a> when the black chick made the white chick question herself😂😂"
"What they don’t know is that every person creates their own truth based on their belief system. Someone’s truth can be that smoking cigarettes is healthy if their belief system supports that idea and another person’s truth can be that smoking cigarettes is deadly. Both can be right and both can experience a confirmation of their truth because their belief system is strong enough to support it no matter how different is for others. So, debating about whose truth is more truthful is NONSENSE because truth is subjective and can override collective truths. For example, if most of the people experience a certain situation in a certain way (this is how science creates studies and theories) there can be someone or even a few people who don’t experience the same results of the same situation simply because they have a very different belief rooted in their subconscious that don’t allow the “collective” truth to be. <br><br>We create our truth and it’s made out of our beliefs and our beliefs are made out of our experiences. <br><br>These guys are wasting their time. There is NOOO universal truth. <br><br>Humans can fly, humans can be invisible, humans can grow limbs. The only reason we haven’t seen any of these is because no human has managed to make any of these things part of their belief system but we will see it eventually"
And they all LOSE THEIR SH*T when he says &quot;blacks&quot; LMFAOOOO

Tf she talkin bout “thousands of decades”? He’s had his truth since 8000 BC? Before the first civilization existed? When there were cavemen?
Most nicest liberal ever
Off topic but the guy in the CM Punk shirt earned my respect simply for his shirt 😂
"For some people, accountability is like kryptonite."
Soon as she said &quot;everything is subjective&quot; there&#39;s a problem
"wot a bunch of negative old dogs commenting...........<br>these students are a credit, opening their minds, forming opinions and disagreeing without being disagreeable."
"I’d ask those women this; What is higher, the amount of unlawful, innocent people in prison? Or the amount of unsolved crimes and missing people (specifically children)."
"How can he talk about facts when he reverts to the &quot;soul&quot; as something definitive?<br><br>Everybody with an ounce of intelligence knows that creationism, afterlife, spirits, God etc is nothing more than blind faith with absolutely no evidence to support it.<br><br><br>He ruins a perfectly valid argument by using his faith and making himself a hypocrite."
This generation be dizzy blood🤦🏾‍♂️🤣
"There are a lot of listeners, learning....the truth.....very good!"
These are college students? Man I’m scared for the future generations
The product of postmodernism is people with subjective understanding of what it is truth.
These kids have ZERO SELF CONTROL! Don’t they see that automatically makes them seem wrong if they can’t debate in peace
These entitled brats are spewing thier emotion filled Opinions...Charlie is stating Facts and truth....
"When did people become so stupid. There is only one reality and within that reality there is only one truth. You can have your opinions, beliefs and values but there is no, my truth and your truth, there is only the reality and the truth."
"I believe in law enforcement, not policy and feelings enforcement. Most police these days enforce policies that actually violate civil rights."
What&#39;s up with the gay guy on the far left?
I think I feel I think I feel I think I feel
These college students are getting  quite an education 😂
He is getting them to think for themselves.    Remember Giordano Bruno 1548 -1600   His fate was the main reason Galileo chose to recant his observations of the moons of Jupiter ... orbiting Jupiter.
"Charlie is a s1mp. The woman interrups him constantly, but he allows the woman to lecture HIM with &quot;don&#39;t interrupt me.&quot;"
Imagine humiliating yourself in front of 5 million people 😂😂😂😂
This is the result of Time Out Kids! Its like explaining colors to a blind person!!
Give the young black girl a scholarship
Don&#39;t bring religion into secular debates and you will be supported by all religions and atheists who share your position. I&#39;m disliking the current video for this reason.
"Im a catholic, I believe in the soul, but still, science havent prove without a trace off doubt that the soul exist and still I choose to believe because faith. We can say that soul exist, but its not an undisputable truth until its prove"
That white girl is exactly the type Malcolm X warned us about.
"“Why is it when the police got militarized, crime went up and more people went to prison?” Crime “went up” because they caught more of the people bro how do you not get it😭💀"
They say they don’t believe we have souls but also believe you can be a man trapped in a woman’s body? Make that make sense
"If you want a role model for accountability, you have Trump.  WoW!   After Nov 4, Trump supporters will be really depressed."
"The students LAST statement is superb :  &#39;Militarization of the police resulted in MORE  people being arrested for crimes &#39; Duuuuhhhh,  a logical person would  hope so.   Look at the  state of cities today,   NO Bail,  NO jail time =  INCREASED CRIME.  Please take a Logic course in college."
The ignorance and arrogance of these college students is both apparent and appalling.
THIS IS called civil dialogue. These college kids are future leaders. Nothin wrong in questioning?
"We pay for this . We pay taxes to teach young minds ,or warp their minds . I love when you said blacks ,and corrected them by BLM .LOVE IT .JESUS BLESS YOU 🙏"
Many talk show people  hold reign ABOVE others.
"Charlie, you should invite Larry Elder to go on campus tour with you. College kids should see more sane black voices like him talk. Thomas Sowell would be great but I doubt he wants to do it."
"If we’re having a civil discussion, agreeing or not, if you throw in “you’re an idiot, lemme tell you why” the conversation is OVER even if you have 37 valid reasons for your claim."
Surplus from the Army had to go somewhere....Police....
Why are they all looking for excuses fot things being bad. Instead of making them better.
Holy shit it&#39;s so funny watching the blonde
I wish I was young and dumb again. Experience robs you of that time when you genuinely believe that you understand everything. Treasure your moments of self admiration and intellectual superiority because lifes paths and realities will take this momentary bliss far away frim you.
Dude on the left wants respect but calls Charlie an idiot then calls the guy next to him and idiot for just asking him to let Charlie speak
@charliekirk Pleasee meet with the LDS missionaries I know you’ll love them and love having a conversation with them! :)
"So, why is it that they always start with the question, &quot;Is murder wrong&quot;? I&#39;ll tell you why, because most individuals with even the slightest empathy will answer yes. But why is it that the states that have pass the most restrictive abortions laws (even excluding rape and incest) all have the death penalty and are still using it? It&#39;s NOT about murder or pro-life it&#39;s about control!"
Check ✔️ ✅️ Check they are so blind of there privilege
"At one point when she messed up ( lied ) she said &quot;oh that&#39;s a bit embarrassing&quot;! Lol understatement of the past thousands of decades! The next generation are going to be traumatised by all the awful videos of their parent&#39;s hypocrisy, shame, and noody pics!!"
"Charlie I have enormous respect for your courage, knowledge of history, constitution, biblical principles and more. God definitely has gifted you with thick skin lol. God Bless you ."
These young students are so cringey
In the &#39;90s after the Bank of America North Hollywood bank robbery where the robbers had AK47s and out gunned the LAPD became militarized. After that squad cars and SWAT teams were outfitted with AR15s and other heavy weapons.
thomas soules &quot; who&quot; &quot; LBJ&quot; who ? not bill clinton who was &quot; el BJ&quot; the fact that these people knew no historical figures in the civil rights movement  but tried to school him was laughable
If all you have to ask is &quot;why do you think you&#39;re more right&quot; then you already lost
speculation vs facts
Crime went down in the 80s due to 2 things. <br>&quot;Nobody Says I want to be a junkie when I grow up&quot; <br>&quot;21 Jump Street&quot;
&quot;The crime rates drop because of abortions&quot; is hilarious
I REALLY want to sit down with (You) Charlie Kirk &amp; have an intelligent conversation ! I am tired of talking to STUPID people !
"Thomas Sowell is a national treasure and has opened my eyes. Milton Friedman too. Much of what Mr Kirk is teaching here is masterfully explained in their books and videos of interviews and debates. Thank you, Mr Kirk, for supporting their legacy of wisdom and fact-based teachings."
And these kids will be the future of this country?  They are so ignorance.
I say blacks because not everyone is African and not every one is American.
"Q: What&#39;s the definition of mass confusion?<br>A: Father&#39;s Day in Harlem.<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23factsmatter"">#FactsMatter</a>."
It’s so sad to see young people having their minds destroyed by the woke mind virus. I pray for my children daily.
These college kids are passive learners and seriously lacking critical thinking skills.  No one was able to bring up arguments backed by strong logic and facts.
"It&#39;s really sad that students don&#39;t know that 6% of slaves were owned by black business owners. That&#39;s 700,000 people that were enslaved by blacks. Of the 3.8 million slaves that shows that slavery was an economic element far more than a racial element. Slavery was first discovered in Portugal. The first black slaves were brought to South America for several hundred years prior to the English and US slave trade. Educate yourself BEFORE you start making ignorant statements and decisions."
The future of America doesn’t look good!!!
Doesn&#39;t she think her opinion is above his? Thats why they&#39;re called opinions.
"Lol she doesn&#39;t know who Thomas Sowell is the singlemost impressive black intellectual mind in the world... yes cleverer  than Morgan Freeman! I have read most of his books I am white, male, British and over 50!"
"Ask, why do believe race is an issue? Answer...because you were taught it is."
All immature children (oh btw ppl are tryna say hes abusive (kirk or wtv his name is) and cancel him
This is what happens when you&#39;re so woke you haven&#39;t slept.<br><br>Truth is no amount of WOKE can fix issues that actually matters
"Charly, you are right, but  you need help explaining spiritual points.   I could use Rosie much better when she asked about “soul”.  Anyways… Tnx. Charly."
God I’m so tired of this ridiculous BS…. But I still keep watching 😂😂😂
when are you running for President bro?
I was taking a test for the Chicago Police Department in 1988 at Lane Tech high school They had given me the wrong test and I asked them what the wrong test was and they said this is a test for minorities. I asked them what the difference was they replied by say it was an easier test and not as complicated!!<br>1988!!!!
&quot;We are not rich duh...&quot;<br>you all are! all student are poor! you only get rich when you earn your own money...<br>those kids you call rich are just spoild brats!
"Yes, Charlie, there is an objective reality - and based on what we know about it, there is no soul."
"why did the black guy with dreads call Charlie stupid? that is so uncalled for. Charlie knows a lot, and learns a lot.. he should be learning from him, instead of insulting him."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=160"">2:40</a> Wow Charlie, the hypocrisy. Now talking about the murder rates in other races is racist? So convenient indeed. That was a very cheap shot and red herring. We don&#39;t know if there is such a thing as a &quot;soul&quot;, let alone what it is. Lacking the humility to admit that doesn&#39;t put at you a better position (the argument from ignorance fallacy)."
"Crime rates (especially violent crime) grew sharply in the late 60s-70s in mainly urban areas w/ high no. of black people.  It was the result of economic disinvestment, unemployment, the heroin epidemic, and rising tensions between communities and law enforcement."
The Soul is the nonvisible being that comes out of your body after DNA is completely destroyed.  My gosh!  Where do they learn this spooky stuff?
Was that black girl with a face mask expecting to hear something other than the simple truth? 😂😂😂
The country is doomed if this continues
I salute every conservative who attends College... I wouldn&#39;t be able to take these nutjobs
"She kept asking why does his opinion trump others...well it doesnt, but that implies others opinions could or should trump his if not worded correctly. I dont think she knows what shes trying to get at.<br><br>I get it, shes poor at debates because doesnt have rhe wxperience, but thening specifically to a prochoice argument just gets off track. I wish charlie instead steered the conversation toward the measurable effects of opinions and choices, rhats more foindationally coherent and easier to defend than to go in circles over voccabulary.<br><br>At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=180"">3:00</a> im reminded of a diffrrent video where a man supported not displaying publicly, certain types of statistics, because he didnt want racists to have the tools to draw certain inferences. Thats a horrible justification, because it says to me that ppl dont have the privlesge to be wrong, have their ideas challanged or minds changed of it risks upsetting somelne else. Unfortunately that is the very core of discussion and debate. Those are the only tools we as a civilisted culture have to parse ideas without violence. So dayong or implying that you cant risk making someone uncomfortable whule commuiicating with them, kinda also means you support the use of violence in some way to force change, over debate. <br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=590"">9:50</a> that&#39;s just a bitchy thing to say, its not even a point. They changed the subject, then get uppity when je stated he doesnt know about that particular thing? Charlie is wrong here however, more heavily equipping police as a reaumt to rhe 70&#39;s crime wave, didnt militarise the police as she&#39;s likely talking about, that happened in the eaely 90&#39;s after a single broadcast of a back robbery that used AR&#39;s. There was a heavy push by manufacturers to expand into the police as a market, as well as expanding legislation and removing accountability features that favoured police. Then 9/11 happened and suddenly every police station needed to be equipped with anti terrorism policies, that were used predominately on non terror suspects. Imagine in 2004, watching your local police station drilling on how to handle a biological attack in a home depot parking lot, of a town with a population or 25,000. I dont rhink charlie would be so pro police after he hears about qualified immunity,  civil asset forfeiture, and how rhey pushed to keep feild tests are known to a 50% accuracy rate."
There was nothing in this about accountability... At all...
Lol he&#39;s smart until it comes to his bullcrap religion. &quot;What is a soul&quot; .. he couldn&#39;t answer that 😅
the name calling like little kids is absolutely wildddddd. they shouldn&#39;t be able to vote
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=346"">5:46</a>. There&#39;s only one race miss. N that&#39;s the human race.  Duh!! Racist much??"
"Its quite obvious, SHE thinks her opinion, is better than another persons opinion, because DADDY says she is a good girl and she is right."
"Everything is subjective<br>Math, Physics, especially Biology teachers what the hell you re teaching your students? 1+1=11 is correct because your student think so?"

Good to get a glimpse of the future of America. White girl looking like the future lawyer for the BLM movement. Note to BLM You can do much better!
"I’m not Republican I’m not Democratic but I do know this shit isn’t helpful at all. Like, setting up dead end debates between people who have already previously decided they can’t be convinced otherwise. That’s the shit I’m referring to, left, right, or otherwise"
Why do i torture myself with these videos
"&quot;No matter what my candidate does, I&#39;ll still vote for them&quot; is a crazy statement"
Political videos are like crack once you start watching you can&#39;t stop.
"Wait, why did the moderator just single out the black woman and say he can&#39;t include the clips of her &quot;yelling over people&quot; when everyone else was literally doing the same thing? Uhh macroaggression much"
"I am not even a US citizen, why am I still watching these 😭"
"You should do a Middle Ground, but everyone is Undecided."
WHO allowed the chick who said kamala could’ve slept with 4.5 million voters in this episode 😭
Not the micro aggressive “moderator” everyone was yelling over each other
Jubilee really milking this election
I’d love to see a panel of all well informed people who can have a debate without letting emotions take control
You guys should do a undecided voters episode
"I hope we all know that it doesn&#39;t matter who is in the &#39;top job&#39; because this is a systemic problem -- greed. We have allowed many of our economic sectors, to take advantage of the American people. It&#39;s disgusting and frightening for the future of our country. My husband and I will be retiring in the next two years n another country. We are absolutely worried that SSI will no longer be funded. we&#39;ll have to rely on his pension, a 403 (b) and a very prolific lnvestment account with my Abby Joseph Cohen my FA. Our national debt is bloating and expanding every month. Our government needs to get spending under control and cut the federal budget."
Moderator really wasn&#39;t having it today 😭😭
The guy in the middle: &quot;We can&#39;t include parts where you&#39;re yelling...&quot;<br>Jubilee: <b>Includes the parts where they&#39;re yelling</b> 🤣
"As a liberal, guy in the blue sweatshirt is frustrating. He just won’t let people talk"
Jubilee I suggest you coach the moderator to not engage in micro aggressions. There was no reason for him to stop the video just to tell Zion that they can’t have her yelling when everyone was talking over one another. I’m pretty sure that happens with every jubilee video so why call her out specifically and no one else?
the guy in the light blue hoodie was letting his emotions get the best of him sooooo much
The loudest fastest talkers are always the one doing the least thinking before they speak.
The &quot;broooo&quot; in blue has the emotional control of a third grader.
it’s crazy how the moderator called that one girl out for overlapping when literally everyone else was doing it as well. i’ve also seen him call out a specific side in other videos even when the opposite side was doing the same exact thing. either call them all out or don’t say anything. he’s my least favorite moderator
"thank you for including moderators in these recent debates, ive really seen a difference in the quality of the debates"
"That blue hoodie guy needs to GET.IT.TOGETHER. Disrespecting the other side is the worst thing anyone could do in a debate, and this guy was booming with his explosive emotions!"
"As soon as he shouted &quot;its in the bible, not now.&quot; i knew he has no idea whats going on outside his state never mind the US."
"I’m actually surprised no one is calling out the micro aggression displayed by the moderator starting at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1403"">23:23</a>. She was not yelling, she was responding just like everyone else. Why stop the entire video and tell the ONE black woman to stop yelling when she was simply responding/talking over the others like everyone else? kinda disgusted"
"I really liked the way he moderated this time around. He really kept them focused on the topic at hand, didn’t let disrespect slide, allowed a everyone to get their point through, and somehow managed to keep both sides calm.<br><br>Great job."
Blue hoodie starts speaking before he even knows what he&#39;s going to say 😂
bro in light blue tweaking 😭
Everyone was overlapping. Why only address the black woman? And she wasn&#39;t yelling.
He is offended by the term &quot;3rd world country&quot; but will do the &quot;crazy&quot; sign when talking about mental illness... the guy in the light blue is such an annoying angry hypocrite.
How tf do people already have an opinion of a 1 hour video if it got uploaded 16 minutes ago?!
"As a Canadian, I seriously wonder how much America could progress if they were focused less on the candidates and more on the policies."
I dnt even want to watch this. It&#39;s just annoying af. Mainly blue hoodie guy.
"&quot;No matter who wins, we&#39;ll be ok&quot;. The men stepped forward. This was one of the most striking moments of the entire discussion."
“You can’t go after Kamala her record is impeccable” I laughed out loud
"4 Professional Conservative Debaters vs 4 Professional Liberal Debaters???<br><br>I really just want to watch a video with a bunch of people who know what they&#39;re talking about.<br><br>Edit: Yes, I know the way to get a more informed perspective is by reading academia and not watching Jubilee videos, most people will not bother to do that, so there is value in having more knowledgeable people on a very mainstream platform, such as Jubilee."
“And how is it affecting you?” Lol girl are you not paying taxes
"Wow the hatred between the two groups is unreal. America is a sitcom. “No matter what my president does,I’ll still vote for him” is crazy, let that sink in for a minute."
I’m from Peru and I don’t know a single Peruvian who would get offended by recognizing that we  are a third-world country.
"Sometimes I get so annoyed because of huge points people miss speaking on!!! However, I REALLY appreciate the moderating truly stepping in this time FINALLY!!! Allows for more of a conversation"
I just love the nuance of the microaggression provided by the moderator. Everyone was yelling over each other but yes let’s single out the black lady 😒 pathetic
The dude in the light blue sweatshirt needs a Xanax
I feel bad for Mason being lumped together with the other Harris supporters. He truly deserved a better set of people.
"I&#39;m sorry, but the dude in the light blue hoodie is insufferable."
I vote blue but the guy in the blue sweatshirt shouldn’t have been allowed to participate. You can’t make a valid argument when all you do is yell and not hear the other side
"If you are offended by the term “3rd world country”, you are privileged beyond your wildest dreams"
As someone from an actual third world country I’m offended that dude is offended by it. It’s just the reality. Acknowledge us. We are called third world country for a reason. Too much corruption. And way under developed. There’s plenty of us here.
John (the moderator) is under appreciated— definitely my favorite person to moderate these discussions.
"I just want to make it clear for those who are saying the ONLY black girl on the panel was YELLING???? Specifically around the 20-24 min mark… you’re all incorrect, talking over someone because you to would like to be heard instead of skipped over… does not equate to yelling. You’re all showing your micro-aggression by not understanding the difference between an angry black women &amp; a black women with assertion as she speaks."
Pretty clear to see which side can have an actual conversation without constant emotions and interruptions 😅
"&quot;The term &#39;third world&#39; is offensive to me, bro&quot;<br>Your feelings aren&#39;t going to make Somalia a utopian paradise lmao"
The fact that one side COULD NOT say that extremism also exists on their side of the political isle is CRAZY.
Zion &amp; the dude in the blue were super emotional. Like STOP yelling and cutting people off when they talk. The black woman in the blazer was the best one. She actually articulated her points. The conservatives actually talked as well.
THANK YOU for finally moderating the panel. Trying hard to keep bringing it back to the actual question at hand.
Dude in the blue hoodie was unhinged out the gate.... what a psycho
Did she just say kamala&#39;s record and policy is impeccable?.
Absolutely disgusting display of micro aggressions from the moderator. Do better!
that Filipino guy was so toxic
Kamala Harris supporters not interrupt challenge: impossible
"Pretending the 3rd world doesn&#39;t exist is deeply concerning. If we don&#39;t acknowledge the conditions, what is he expecting to change?"
Did she really just ask how illegal immigrants coming into this country is affecting us. That’s all I need to hear from someone to know that they have not a single clue on what we really need for this country I’m honestly speechless
“I wasn’t yelling” literally yelled multiple times
Facts over feelings. <br>Logic over EMOTIONS.
"Zion and Blue Hoodie are unbearable. Their constant yelling over people and being emotional is draining and distracting, they dont let people talk"
Listening the the one chick call AR’s “automatic” was painful.
"As a Filipino, we do not claim that person in a blue hoodie. What a disgrace."
"I read a quote recently that went something like, “As I’ve grown older I realize how little I know. Only a young person knows everything.”"
This is why uninformed ppl shouldnt speak on these issues. These ppl have limited knowledge of what they&#39;re addressing
The moderator needs to go. That interaction between the black woman was so uncalled for and giving very much “stay in your place” as if everyone else wasn’t yelling over her.
"The higher the emotion, the lower the information."
“Do not question my morality.”<br>“I’m questioning it.” 😂
Buddy in the blue need to take a anger management class
I don’t like how this moderator only singled out the black woman about her “yelling” but literally not the others….
&quot;we don&#39;t have to fact check when we&#39;re telling the truth and telling facts&quot;. How does this even come out of someone&#39;s mouth lol
Mason is the only person I’d really like to lead the left’s points. Please let Mason back on
"“If it was actually a genocide, it would have ended in two days later, everything would be fine, everyone would be dead.” Where did she get this notion that genocides are over in two days, and how would everyone being dead make it “fine?”"
&quot;No need to fact check when everything [Harris] says is factual&quot;<br>&quot;It&#39;s hard to go after her record when her record is impeccable.&quot; <br><br>These are the people you cannot have a serious discussion with.
"&quot;No matter who wins, we&#39;ll be okay.&quot;<br>All the men stepped forward and the women stayed back.<br>No matter what happens in November, I&#39;m going to do everything in my power to make sure my family is okay."
Dude in the blue hoodie yelled more than anyone else
Not feeling that micro aggression from the moderator to the black woman for singling her out. I’ve been watching jubilee for years and people ALWAYS yell over each other but singling her out was such an “angry black woman” vibe like cmon now.
"What concerns me is no longer who gets in office, what truly concerns me is the dynamic in which (the majority) of these people are treating one another. We&#39;ve all had different upbringings, experiences, and perspectives. We&#39;ve all fallen victim to political lies at some point, and truly, to believe solely in one candidate, is concerning. At the end of the day, we have to care care of one another, and understand it&#39;s our differences in perspectives and experiences that is what should be treated like gold. Because together, we are stronger."
&quot;If it was a genocide it would have ended like 2 days later&quot; <br><br>WWII called. They said hey.
"As a lifelong Democrat, the fact that 3/4 of the dems don&#39;t think there are extremists on their side is exactly the type of thinking that made me realize the Democratic party runs on emotions and not logic. <br><br>Even as a Democrat myself I can&#39;t help but see this as uninformed emotions vs logical assessments. I feel very disillusioned with my party."
Everyone was yelling over each other so why is he singling her out? Weird
Emotional voters are dangerous
They need to stop bringing this little Republican girl to the debates oml.
Moderator literally peforming microagression by specifically calling out the black girl for &quot;yelling&quot; over people when literally everyone was constantly talking over each other. And the decision to keep that clip in is very telling jubilee...
"This moderator had me pleasantly surprised. He moderated well and when things got out of control, he swept in and put everyone back on track.<br><br>And especially when he asked the question if anyone agreed that there were extreme people on their side. The progressive side gave what he deemed to be a disingenuous answer and he called them out for it, rightfully so."
&quot;In the bible bro NOT NOW!!!&quot; <br>Damn...he really doesn&#39;t know what happens in islamic countries does he?
"When the guy in light blue talks, all I hear is a baby crying"
Liberals are so funny! They really are sensitive to just about anything😂😂
"I&#39;m African, from Nigeria and the term &quot;third world&quot; is not offensive. Don&#39;t be offended on my behalf. It&#39;s the truth, and yes, many 3rd world countries are indeed &quot;shithole&quot; countries. If you&#39;ve lived here, you would understand, and if they were not, their citizens wouldn&#39;t be leaving to the US in droves."
"As a Filipino, that bro is the softest, most-sensitive Filipino I know. Really?? The term-third world offends you? 😂"
Omg that girl calling Kamala impeccable 😂 I just can&#39;t.
The vet chick I call bull. No way she is a vet and calling Guns (A.R) Machine guns. That’s incredibly ignorant.
Calling Harris &quot;impeccable&quot; is just a clear sign that she has not looked into her record. I would push Jubilee to host a longer form debate style with higher educated guests.
Please be more specific with the fact checks. 8.2 million at the border isn&#39;t a meaningful statistic without telling me if it was last year or over the last 4 years or another time period.
the entire jubilee social media team needs a raise for how well they’ve marketed the channel over the past few weeks
Kamala came with facts?! WHERE PLEASE SHOW ME THE FACTS!
Can we get a middle class vs the ultra wealthy debate? I don&#39;t think people realize that we aren&#39;t divided by party but by wealth.
On behalf of the Filipino American community we don’t claim Erick. That dude is a clown and not a comedian 🤡
The guy from Phillipines is so emotional😂😂😂
blue hoodie guy is such a bitter angry person
The American exceptionalism is wild. As a Canadian I feel like I won the lottery by NOT being born in the US.
So everyone else was yelling over each other and somehow only ONE girl in particular gets singled out…hmmm
That guy in blue sweater yelling all the time had emotional damage.
Kamala has a horrible record.
Mason seemed like the only person that actually wanted to have a civil debate
Jubilee has been absolutely locking in
Jubilee be feeding us political content
"&quot;Third World&quot; should not be offensive. The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality. I am from the third world, and this doesn&#39;t make me subhuman."
I feel so sorry for John the moderator. I hope they are paying him well lol.
The “moderator” calling out the black woman in front of everyone for “yelling” yet every single person there was “overlapping” and “yelling”.  It’s crazy that so many people are skipping over this micro aggression.
Bro is getting better with moderating! The way he keeps up with people’s original points and questions in the middle of all the screeching back and forth is next level!
"wow, the democrats not being ashamed of ANYONE on their side, is absolutely insane and telling."
That girl actually just said “how does immigration affect you?”<br><br>Can’t make this up
"Shout out to Mason, very clear, concise and respectful!"
Imagine saying someone has an impeccable record and then only naming the titles that they have held. No policy. No record. Just titles. Lot of bad people in history have held a lot of titles…how impeccable are their records?
that moderator displayed clear and blatant micro aggression towards that black lady .. that’s actually crazy
is there a reasons the moderator singled her out? everyone was speaking over each other…
Please be more specific with the fact checks. 8.2 million at the border isn&#39;t a meaningful statistic without telling me if it was last year or over the last 4 years or another time period.
the guy in blue hoodie is so irritating bruhh he talks so offensive
Dude in the light blue hoodie didn’t add to any conversation in this video. Everybody else brought valid points on both sides.
it’s wildly racist that the moderator literally singled out that one black girl like wtf
There is a major lack of political knowledge in this video is crazy
"I really enjoyed hearing from Joe, Mason, and Osiris. You can tell they are smart and they care about people."
"Girl: * shouts *<br>Moderator: To have a conversation you need to stop shouting.<br>Girl: I wasn&#39;t shouting.<br><br>Girl, we got you in 4K HD shouting, stop with the gaslighting. 😂"
I’m so shocked no one is talking about the micro aggression displayed by this moderator. That’s crazy work
The same &quot;not yelling&quot; woman who corrected the pronunciation of Comma-La later said Ka-MAH-La.  LoL
"&quot;If it was a genocide, it would have ended 2 days later, would be flattened and everyone would have been dead&quot; is such an atrocious statement to make"
Dude in the Blue is softer than that sweater he’s wearing lol … he got that victim mentality 😂😂
Everyone was interrupting each other. So why did the moderator fix his simple self to stand up and single the black woman out in front of everyone? I&#39;ve literally NEVER seen this happen on jubilee for.
As a liberal: I cannot stand liberals.
I am a democrat but Osiris was a Class Act. He communicated his points factually and without hyperbolic extremist accusations. <br>We need more people like him
"Zion jumped in to correct the other girl for saying Kamala wrong but pronounces it the same way at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=2190"">36:30</a>. 😂😂"
I like how he just called out the blk girl like everyone else wasn’t yelling over each too…
“We cannot include parts where you’re yelling over people.”<br><br>I’M NOT YELLING!?! 😂
"The gaslighting “I am not yelling!”  Ma’am, you were absolutely YELLING."
The girl that said “how is it affecting you?”<br>GIRLLLLLL they’re living on our TAX PAYING DOLLARS <br>Common sense here pls.
The moderator targeting the young black girl for “yelling” when she’s talking just like everyone else is disgusting. The moderator couldn’t control the racism spewing out of him.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=18"">0:18</a> Even john is tired of these😭"
"The most frustrating part of debates like these is the overwhelming, uncomfortable feeling that arises when either side refuses to consider other perspectives. When emotions take over and people become aggressive, it shuts down meaningful dialogue and leaves little room for progress.<br><br>Both sides were guilty of this at times, but I appreciated the moments when they tried to keep it civil and respectful. Our emotions can become our worst enemies if we don&#39;t learn to understand them as our allies first."
"People need to stop saying the 2nd amendment exists so you can protect your family. That’s certainly a perk, but it exists so we can stand against a tyrannical government. Hunting, self defense, etc are all benefits of the 2nd amendment, but first and foremost it is so we can keep our government in check"
"Um, why did the moderator single out the black woman as if everyone wasn&#39;t talking over each other and interrupting???"
I never have commented on one YouTube video in my life but I just have to say that this moderator is the best one on this channel. He is consistent &amp; stays pretty neutral!
“It’s hard to go after her record cause it’s impeccable”…..I never laughed so hard in my life
The liberal guy in light blue knows so much that just isn’t true.
The moderator idk something about he solely directing the yelling comment at shawty when they all was over talkin each other it felt microaggressive and tone deaf
The dude who said tipped employees already dont have to pay taxes does not know what he is talking about.
Kamala is &quot;impeccable??? 😂
yall brought that girl back 😭😭
"Not them stopping the whole discussion just to single out the black girl for “yelling”. As if I can’t pull up multiple clips of people actually yelling, this is why I hate jubilee, micro aggression at its finest."
guy in the blue hoodie is SOFT even if you disagree with the other side there’s no reason to act like that
“Do not question my morality”<br><br>“I’m questioning it” <br><br>😂
It&#39;s priceless to see  the Dr. talks passionately about  her family fleeing from persecution and yet not be  understanding of others.
The micro aggressions from the moderator singling the black woman out?????
You can tell which side is full of hatred.
It’s insane how so many don’t understand economics. Inflation is caused by the devalumdnt of our currency (USD) our government borrows money at an alarming rate. Plus the price of goods has increased because the price of oil has increased. The two biggest oil exporters are locked in wars at the moment. Oil is king! Oil being more expensive makes EVERYTHING more expensive.
Blue hoodie needs to take a little nap
It’s Jubilee I’ve never seen the moderators call out people for debating or yelling. Yet we want to do it to the black girl?
"Anyone who agrees with the first prompt is not a reasonable person. If there is no dealbreaker for a candidate, you are in a cult."
I LITERALLY knew who was on what side the second I saw faces.
"Everyone yelling over everyone, yet she gets called out for it? Please be so serious 😒"
"Pretty clear the difference between the sides, One side is yelling over the ones that want to have a civil conversation 😂😂"
&quot;Why does someone have to contribute to recieve those resources&quot; the millions of working americans who contribute and will never be eligible to recieve those resources
"Why is there such a blatant difference between one side that can discuss, and one that has a difficult time with basic emotion control?"
"We are so close to China, Russia and Iran being capable of knocking out our infastructure! If that happens we are all going to wish we had lots of guns! This isnt the 1920s anymore! The threat is real of an invastion!"
I really hate the guy in light blue and Zion<br>Extremely cocky and condescending.
"“And how is it affecting you”.. “I will tell you” proceeds to tell her, and then she has a LOST FACE LMAO"
"As a fellow Philippino American, I’m ashamed at how much of a victim the gentleman in the blue hoodie is."
yes let’s reprimand the black woman for “yelling” when she literally wasn’t yelling and she was doing the same thing all the participants do in every debate
AR 15 is NOT a machine gun! That veteran should know this.
The fact that everyone let her say that fully automatic weapons are legal is wild.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1910"">31:50</a>  girl. I grew up in Jacksonville Fl. In the hood! These people will always have guns girl! You going to go to bat with someone that has a automatic gun then a regular one"
these people who cannot admit there are extremists are their side are the MOST dangerous
That Erik guy is the most insufferable victim to grace jubilee and that’s saying a lot
"It’s easy to see who actually makes an effort to fact check what the media is feeding them, and who guzzles it down w abandon without a second thought.<br><br>Shout out to the fact checking on this channel. Everyone should fact check EVERY media narrative via the sponsor of this debate."
"As a European, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever understand the blind devotion Americans have to their country.. &quot;Us as Americans, all of us hit the lottery when we got born here.&quot; &quot;America is the greatest country on earth...&quot; And then they keep talking about the most ridiculous issues like gun violence, inaccessible health care, student loans, etc..."
Not mentioning the 30+ LIES Kamala was pushing during the debate was a big miss
I’m black and that black girl and filipino dude getting on my nerves lol!!! Everything based on emotion… the people are here - the part to secure us has already passed
I’m Filipino and we do not claim that guy. Dudes crazy..
“kamala has an impeccable record.”<br>the prisoners who had their sentences extended for cheap labor: 👁️👄👁️
I’m just here because the host was being racist towards the black girl.
"Saying Kamala is “Impeccable” (and meaning it), is wild!"
“Well It’s hard to go after her record when it’s impeccable” I spit my drink out<br><br>Edit: I’m fairly middle ground. But there’s a reason Kamala Harris lost the democratic primary elective vote for PRESIDENT last election. And she didn’t earn it this election either.
&quot;It’s hard to go after her record when she&#39;s impeccable.&quot; I couldn&#39;t stop laughing after that.
"This was the perfect example of liberals 😂 they just can&#39;t have a conversation. They can only talk about how things make them feel, no facts."
Big guy in the tan shirt represents a silent majority.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=352"">5:52</a> “your people” crazy"
Guy in blue shirt needs psychological help😂
"as someone that voted for biden, opening my eyes and actually listening to reasoning and how things actually DO affect us, i did a complete 180"
Why are the Kamala supporters just yelling the whole time 😂
I like that John is putting his foot down more.
the guy in the blue hoodie is to caught in his emotions to debate
Jubilee needs to address the microaggression that occurred when the moderator singled out the only Black woman in the group. To reprimand her for behavior that other participants are displaying is very telling.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=2190"">36:30</a> why didn&#39;t they correct how she said her name?  hypocrisy is real."
DUDE IN LIGHT BLUE IS OFFENDED BY AIR
Dude in the blue sweatshirt thinks he&#39;s smart.  He&#39;s NOT.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1942"">32:22</a> says she is a veteran but doesn&#39;t know the average gun owner can&#39;t have a machine gun. You have to be approved by the federal government for that."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1695"">28:15</a> this girl has said homophobic and racist things 😂😂😂 she just keeps outing herself in these vidoes"
All he heard was the black woman “yelling” when the whole panel was doing what they brought them there to do.. have an debate ..ugh the micro aggression is crazy 🙄
The guy in the blue was cutting ppl off the whole time and everyone was talking over everyone but you call out and single out the only black women. Interesting. Take him out
The Filipino dude is more emocional than my wife on her period 😂
"@JohnRegalado the way you singled out the young black woman during this discussion &amp; tried to state that she was YELLING. wicked work. &amp; WILD to state when everyone was indeed talking over eachother. Like she said, she was not yelling. Not even gonna go into the detail of how that LOOKS for you to be saying that to a black woman, but I hope she got an apology when you wrapped because it was 100% uncalled for. Do better or don’t moderate."
"I hate that no one clarified that people seeking asylum are not here illegally no matter how you feel about it, it is a legal process in the US"
That black veteran chick clearly failed the rifle range at boot camp
"As a Filipino American, Erick is just an embarrassment sheesh"
The guy in the blue hoodie is proof that immigrants need to be vetted better.
"I want to thank Jubilee for opening up these conversations. Hate them or love them, these conversations NEED to be had!! Period."
"i have watched tons of jubilee videos where people are yelling/talking over each other. in this video specifically everyone is literally talking over each other, but only the black girl gets called out for “yelling”? interesting…. find urself a better moderator jubilee. not one that’s gonna contribute to the microaggressions of one side"
"The girl who claimed to have been deployed conflated an AR-15 with an Automatic Rifle and Automatic Machine Gun. An AR-15 is semi-automatic and is not much different from semi-automatic pistols in terms of lethality! Even if she never held a gun, this lack of basic gun knowledge from someone in the military is shocking."
"I am a Filipino American. I lived in Philippines for 27 years, nobody there ever thought that calling Philippines a 3rd world country makes us less human. LMAO. That 3rd world country label was never brought up by liberal activists as degrading even today."
Whoever the moderator is needs to be put in his place. Why you getting thinking you the sh*t telling a black woman you gonna cut out the parts where she’s yelling like the whole debate isn’t just y’all yelling back and forth.  jubilee your getting blocked after this
Love Mason &amp; Joe! They have such a great temperament &amp; an ability to be critical about their own side which is SO important.
"As a Filipino myself, we’re not known as dog eaters as Erick mentioned <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=383"">6:23</a>.... Dude is over exaggerating 😂 I’ll joke every so often that we eat Aso (dog in Tagalog) Adobo, but dog eating is more from China, mainly Yulin or Ghana…"
"Homegirl from the hood that&#39;s also a vet, knows nothing that&#39;s going down in her streets, extended mags, everybody by now owns a switch, they don&#39;t rob in the hood they go to the rich neighborhoods. Proves just cause your military doesn&#39;t mean your the sharpest."
"As a Filipino, I did eat a dog when I was young back in the Philippines. It was a cultural thing in some provinces."
The fact that they’re critical about the pronunciation of her name like they know her says a lot about where they stand lol
They didn not expect Zion to be a Vetaran from the Hood 😂
"About the immigration issue, 158 Democrats just voted no on deporting illegal immigrants convicted of sex crimes."
Filipino dude said they didn’t eat dogs in the Philippines 😂
Zion she’s screaming like a lunatic. I am glad the moderator warned her against her bad demeanor.
“Why do they need to contribute for health care!!!”<br><br>That’s all we needed to hear lol
As a European it is always amusing to see US-Americans proclaiming themselves as lucky to be born in the best country in the world.
I’m just wondering why all these people can speak more civilly and articulately about issues/policies than our current leaders and most major media outlets… I respect anyone who is willing to have difficult/uncomfortable conversations (especially publicly).
&quot;IM A VETEREN!&quot; Proceeds to not know the difference between a legal AR15 and an already illegal automatic &quot;machine gun&quot;.
Zion is a veteran but doesn&#39;t know that an AR-15 is not a machine gun...
shoutout the moderator John kept it cool under both parties speaking over each other
She claims to be a vet but refers to a semi automatic weapon as a machine gun
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=2125"">35:25</a> blaming kamala for there being less scholarships is crazy😭 why is this girl back she had horrible arguments in the last video"
“When she’s impeccable” I’m gonna crash out fr
The girl opened her mouth about being in the military. And then called an AR-15 a machine gun. Obviously she didn&#39;t learn anything about guns
I&#39;d love to see Joe and Zekiah have a more intimate discussion. They seemed very respectful and thoughtful.
Why do all of Jubilee&#39;s video pick the WORST democrats or leftists to argue for their side? They almost always try to talk over people and never listen to the other side. I want to give massive props to Mason who was the only reasonable person for the Harris supporters who was able to have a reasionale discussion without getting upset or yelling.
"Omg, this video was so hard to watch! Now I understand better the meaning of &quot; they have eyes but cannot see;  they have ears but cannot hear&quot;."
"Ms. Zion, you should let people enter YOUR home without any restrictions simply because “they deserve it”"
The fact checks in these videos are awesome. Thanks for including those!
&quot;He can&#39;t go after her record because her record is impeccable&quot;<br><br>Sure it is. That&#39;s exactly why she refuses to talk about it and deflects every time it gets brought up.
Lol....Kamala is impeccable??? Wow
Being all posh and over reacting/correcting someone on how they accidentally pronounce her name wrong is such a turn off
Scarf lady saying that the KKK wasn’t a problem because there weren’t enough members is wild
lol why do I just click on these videos only to immediately read the comments 🤣diabolical
This girl who claims  to be a veteran clearly knows nothing about guns
Ben Shapiro vs 20 liberal
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1424"">23:44</a> oh micro aggression"
The “I’m a veteran chick” that had other people guarding her with actual automatic guns needs a reality check
&quot;The term 3rd world is offensive to me like we&#39;re subhuman&quot;  What???
“And how is this affecting you” has to be the most entitled/delusional response.
She said kamala is impeccable on her reputation 😂😂😂😅😅
"One side seems to be more calm, articulate, and smart, the other sides are the opposite (loud, offended by anything, not making sense at times, and etc)."
A veteran calling an AR-15 a machine gun. Which branch was she?
"Bipartisan Border Bill<br>Total size: $118.3 billion<br><br>   - $60 billion in military aid for Ukraine<br>   - $14.1 billion in aid for Israel<br>   - $4.83 billion in aid for the Indo-Pacific region<br>   - $10 billion in humanitarian assistance for Ukraine, Israel, Gaza, among other places<br>   - $2.3 billion in refugee assistance inside the U.S.<br>   - $20.2 billion for improvements to U.S. border security<br>   - $2.72 billion for domestic uranium enrichment<br><br>The majority of the money of this bill has nothing to do with securing the border of the U.S. This is why it was voted against."
Shame on you moderator.. to “not include” a black woman’s point specifically when she is responding like every other person on EVERY OTHER episode including this one.
“I’m offended by the term third world”😂😂
“It’s hard to go after her record when she’s impeccable” THE GLAZING
Automatic rifles are already banned wtf.  Also did she really victim blame and say what are you doing wrong that people are trying to break into your house.
"Single out the black woman when EVERYONE is yelling, you suck John."
These people are goofy if they think citizens from over 160 countries are fleeing persecution. 160+ countries? NO!
I don’t know I don’t study the KKK 😅😂 best quote in the interview 😅
“It’s hard to go off her record because she is impeccable” 🤣what has she done in the past 3.5 years?
tone policing black women is crazy
Don&#39;t they understand he was president for 4 years?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=99"">1:39</a> “I’m afraid to see what our country would look like” acting like he wasn’t president before 💀"
Her saying &quot;I&#39;m a veteran who makes bombs&quot; and then calling AR-15&#39;s machine guns is wild.
Moderator needs to check himself. The micro aggression was so blatant. How did the editor or literally ANYONE sitting there not clock him when he did that? Tf?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=268"">4:28</a> &quot;we don&#39;t have to fact check when we&#39;re telling the truth&quot; ... that&#39;s not how fact checking works Ma&#39;am 😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1400"">23:20</a> Zion: <b>Interrupts and yells</b> “I’m not yelling!” 😂😂😂<br><br>Surprised Jubilee actually pointed that out fairly though"
Can we just appreciate Mason&#39;s honesty and intellect? His positions are well thought out with concrete evidence. 👏👏
why are we singling out the black women if every episode and everyone in this episode is talking over someone?
Blue sport coat is exactly who you would expect to worship someone like Kamala. 😂
"The guy in the brown on the Harris side toward the end you could tell even he annoyed with the others on his side. He was the only reasonable one, thinking with EVERY American in mind. Then his counterparts jump in with wild antics while he’s speaking so eloquently and he just pauses and ignored them 😂"
"the guy in the brown shirt with flowers was so well spoken, that we should all give him a hand"
why was only the black women called out for yelling when the other lady was actually yelling…. hmm 🤔
Blue sweater is annoying and doesn’t have a real opinion on anything.
They failed to mention the reason the “boarder bill” wasn’t passed is bc it includes sending billions more dollars to Ukraine and Israel for some reason.  Idk why but I read the bill and it basically says 1500+ more boarder security and patrol and send a bunch of money to other countries.
The guy in the light blue sweatshirt completely ticked me off
I have seen so much worse from ppl but you tone police the black woman
I stopped caring what the veteran had to say when she thinks owning machine guns are legal. They are already illegal. She thinks AR-15 means automatic rifle 🤣😂🤣😂
When will jubilee actually find well-informed people for these debates and ensure that they stay formal?
"she said that there are no troops in combat zones and thats not true there are still US troops in Iraq, we have ships being shot at in the red sea, we have special forces in Africa and Ukraine"
People were caught eating cats and that&#39;s a fact. Ka&#39;mala  won&#39;t even speak about it because she can&#39;t. She&#39;d have to admit she&#39;s a liar.
“Automatic Rifle” 😂<br><br>Armalite Rifle. “Machine guns” banned in 86.
It’s so funny how quickly they jump on the pronunciation of Kamala when their own president says it wrong. Why are they so triggered. They’re like raging hounds
My rights don’t end where people’s feelings begin.
An hour and they didn&#39;t figure out they are all losers.
"As a spanish person, I find so questionable that several of Trump&#39;s radical statements have to be &quot;watered down&quot; by some of his rather conscious voters. Saying that immigrants eat pets or that completely formed babies are being murdered may be understood as hyperboles  by some people, but in a country where polarization is so present, some crazy people (with guns, even) might take those affirmations literally, and that&#39;s just wildly dangerous."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1365"">22:45</a> Kamala girl got cooked and she knew it💀"
"“Why does someone have to contribute to receive healthcare” is crazyyyyyy work, it cost me $17000 to give birth to my child WITH insurance."
Why are those lefty’s always shouting?
That black girl who claims to be a veteran thinks AR-15s are machine guns 😂😂😂😂😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=225"">3:45</a> well well well"
Eric was fact checked so many times after claiming he did his own research. Lol 😂
"I hate that they don&#39;t bring up that we ruined those countries that those immigrants are coming from, so we have a moral responsibility to do somthing. Yet they all just cry about the innocent civillians who are running away from the authoritarian, heavily corrupt and dangerous place they&#39;re from."
"i don’t get how zion immediately corrected the trumpies on saying kamala’s name incorrectly, then proceeded to do it herself🧍‍♀️"
Why don&#39;t any of these Republicans push back on the border bill and what was actually in it.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=208"">3:28</a> saying that after stating that there’s no genocide in gaza is crazy"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=2806"">46:46</a> LMAO she basically said that that is a problem that doesn’t affect me so I don’t care! That’s wild"
"Crazy how she says you don’t have to fact check something that is true, yet many people proved Harris was wrong on many things on the debate."
America is just a TV drama show at this point 😂
"I would like see a format like this again, but with only age 50+"
I can tell who the host is voting for 😅
"How are people commenting on the video like they have finished it, its only been 4 minutes."
Well Machine guns are all ready federally regulated and you can’t just go legally buy a machine gun..🤣 Even that veteran doesn’t know that and thinks an AR is an assault rifle is laughable. 🤣🤣
"&quot;I&#39;m not yelling&quot; after immidiatly yelling. Thank you for calling out Zion! The entitlment is pallpable. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1415"">23:35</a>"
"Not them making it a big deal and correcting her on how to pronounce Kamala correctly, then later that veteran girl pronounces her name incorrectly the same way"
Watching these videos make me realize why the US is in the situation it is in. When you select a candidate you should be required to complete a multiple choice question on their top things they&#39;re running on (for both sides). Identity politics is an unfortunate reality which prevents growth and leaves people wondering why we are where we are today.
Why they not fact checking Kamala supporters?
"Shes a veteran, but doesn&#39;t know the difference between a US military assault rifle and a civilian AR15....smfh."
"Filipino dude,,, if you so upset… what about you go take that energy and fix your own country!! 🙄"
poor John he was probably screaming on the inside while moderating 😂
"The fact that they just said that there’s no extremists on the Democrat side is wild to me, even as a conservative, I still agree that there are extremists on my side that I wish we’re not there, but it’s the truth. Hopefully people in the comments do not share their sentiment."
She’s a veteran calling a ar15 a machine gun? Yea ok 🙄
Jubilee I’m highly disappointed on how the MODERATOR singled out the one black woman when everyone was talking. Very distasteful and micro aggressive.
Light blue hoodie is disrespectful and rude. How was he chosen as a representative for this show.
Why were they rattled about pronunciation of Kamala 😂.
"This is the first middle ground in a while where they didn’t include hardcore extremists on either side, and the moderator actually moderated fairly. Thank you"
that black lady was not a vet. she doesnt know an ar15 is not automatic?? all her points were beyond ridiculous
"Kamala Harris didn&#39;t say she would give $25,000 to a first-time homeowner. She said it would be a $25,000 tax credit. The difference is enormous. As someone who&#39;s never made over $25,000 in one year it will literally do nothing for me. It will be a huge help to rich folk though."
"The one girls whole point against “weapons of mass destruction” was that there is not groups of people attacking you and you don’t need that type of gun but then later when the point about the K K K was brought up she said she was afraid of that group of people. So which is it, are there groups of people you need to be able to defend yourself against or not?"
She&#39;s a veteran who built bombs but thinks people are walking around with automatic weapons?!? oh boy...
Ka&#39;mala sent people to prison for a little weed because they laughed too much. If we&#39;re going by her logic then she should be locked away for 300 years.
I like how the FactChecks show how way worst the numbers are 😂
They should do Ben Shapiro v 25 liberals
Notice which side is very quick to interrupt to argue a point instead of hearing out the other side.
They are eating the dogs and cats!
"Can you believe the stupidity; she does not have impeccable record? It sounds like “I see nothing, hear nothing” the blind leading the blind! Springfield, Ohio citizens claimed their pets were being eaten in their city council meetings. Look at Vivek town hall meeting in Springfield,Ohio. Unless, you guys are going to play the game “hear nothing and see nothing “."
Took me an hr to realize mason got 1 hand😂
"People already chose their candidates - There&#39;s no undecided at this point, just pretenders"
i cant wait until whoever Wins....just to see the others faces
Holy crow an AR-15 is not a machine gun. It&#39;s not an automatic firearm they are all ready banned. This is probably the worst panel I&#39;ve ever seen
Machine guns have been banned since 1986. Semi-automatic and fully-automatic aren’t the same. Almost every pistol is semi-auto. How does she not know that and how did nobody fact check her?
Erik Is What’s Called A ‘Professional Victim’
"Go ahead and fire that moderator. Such OBVIOUS microagression. She was not yelling. She was speaking the same volume as everyone else. If she was louder than them I think we would&#39;ve heard her points clear as day, however I couldn&#39;t hear ANY of them talking because they were ALL talking over one another. But for him to SINGLE her out.... Very telling. Disgusting behavior for a moderator. He should have spoken to ALL of them and not single one person out. Gross. Don&#39;t let him come back ."
The bipartisan bill they keep talking about only 25% went to the border 60 billion to Ukraine no one ever brings that up
An average person does not require an assault weapon..
We Republicans don&#39;t want Cheney either 👎🏻
I&#39;ll use the term 3rd world all day &amp; all night... bro
mason is so well spoken
"Imagine being a vet and saying ar15 is a machine gun lmao, she build bombs okay yeah you didn&#39;t need a gun because you weren&#39;t a ground soldier and had people guarding you. Why do people think every gun that looks military style is a fully automatic gun?"
That moderator is a saint lmao 😂
I know Jubilee isn’t supporting microagressions? She deserves a public apology.
“Why should they contribute to receive healthcare.” <br>Said someone who I guarantee has never paid taxes in her life.
Can someone please explain to these people that an AR15 is not an assault weapon!!! It&#39;s not full auto!!! Most people do not have a class 3 license to own a full auto weapon!!!!
Is that the plastic surgeon from that other episode???
"Bro everyone for Kamala is so unbalanced and stay cutting people off, can’t even let people finish a statement"
"Just because you are a veteran does not mean you know anything about guns. AR 15 is not a machine gun. Also, 2A shall not be infringed. End of argument"
She is in charge now! Why isn&#39;t she doing it now???
Bro how are ppl saying it’s ok for Palestine to attacking Israel. NEITHER should be attacking the others.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1428"">23:48</a> soooo just wanna say American people go to other countries for both dental and medical treatments that would cost more if they did it here"
It&#39;s a congress&#39; job to come up with border policy. Not the president&#39;s!
"THEYRE EATING THE DOGS, THEYRE EATING THE CATS!"
Mad respect to the moderator
"Why can only 2 people on liberal team keep there act together?  Shocking how one-sidedley rude this Jubilee was. Did not know people were getting this crazy this year, but i guess it should be expected given the guy who was being demonized for 8 + years is close to winning again."
Did I just hear a veteran call an AR 15 a machine gun?
&quot;Why do you have to contribute to receive health care?&quot; wild comment there Zion
That one guy in the blue was so damn annoying the whole time. Why is he so angry
Why he say something to Zion but the dude in the blue hoodie over talking damn near everybody and barley saying anything beneficial from my perspective
the dude in the blue is unhinged.
"“He would have to be something outrageous for me not to vote for him”…. I’m sorry, define outrageous please"
This group was considerably more well spoken than any of the previous debates. Some outbursts but nothing like the other ones with extreme personalities on both sides.
Wonder if girl is going to have the wait and see attitude in a couple years when it comes to illegal immigration 🤔
"I see a group of people being emotional, yelling, basing their views off feelings and another group being logical basing their views off facts"
To be fair the people from the  Philippines do eat dogs. My neighbor behind me is 1st generation from the Philippines and years ago he told me that his friends here in town also from the Philippines catch strays and have them over a bonfire in their back yards.
How is a military &quot;vet&quot; going to equate an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle with a machine gun?
"get that moderator out of here…. weird for calling only one person out, saying she’s yelling, when all she was doing was responding."
Thinking an ar is a machine gun is crazy.
Question 1. Voting for a candidate despite if they do something horrible is the exact reason why politics is a joke.
The tan shirt guy is definitely the guy I most align with. (They should wear nametags lol😂)
Why those dems all so mad
How are you calling this  &quot;Middle Ground&quot; when you are causing tension and beef between Americans?
She said they have a map to recieve free health care...that&#39;s wild because thats probably how Canadians talk about Americans because Canada has ACTUAL free health care 😂
I’ve realized that Aniela takes part of these videos a lot
Zion and the blue hoodie guy are the worst kinds of people. Can&#39;t even have a conversation.
"I love people who want to ban guns still think AR15s are machine guns. It’s crazy no one corrected her, or it was edited out."
Now this is the conversation we need
Haris supporters are delusional😅 dude in the blue sweater is emotional and needs to calm down.
The blue hoodie is a cry baby and won’t let people talk 😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡
The Zionist in the beginning who brought up genocide really thought that was a flex 😂
brooooo in the blue a disgrace to all filipino’s (im filipino) dude is an emotional mess wtf 😭
The more of these videos I watch the more I really can’t stand liberals. And I used to be one.
"blue hoodie and the veteran lady were insufferable. truly hard to watch because of them. everyone else was very civil and actually seemed to want to debate each other, while they clearly just wanted to fight. glad the moderator stepped in."
You guys need to get better at moderating these. 3/10
"I’m mad anyone is arguing with the Pakistani immigrant over morality towards immigrants..yes we want to help everyone, but realistically, can we?"
Sad blue sweater guy and vet girl should have just stay home😅
Don’t bring this moderator back that was a whole micro aggression
The 25k for first time home buyers will be dpg eared for immigrants.
That was very weird of the moderator 🤨
I love the question on if you agree with policies on the other side. I consider myself independent and feel both sides have some decent policies.
why the democrats supporters just screaming over and over again
this moderator sucks smh
us filipinos dont claim the guy in blue sweatshirt
racist micro aggressive moderator yelling at the black woman but not anyone else
"Why is it so hard to understand the concept of illegal<br>Immigrants..<br>That’s like someone coming into your house uninvited, not doing chores or contributing.. then eating all your food and taking your bed.."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=285"">4:45</a> Why wasn’t this fact-checked? Hypocrites…"
as a democrat these democrats were embarrassing
jubilee COUNT UR DAYSS! the micro-aggressions in this video was crazy… everyone was “yelling” or speaking over each other not only in this video but other videos and u had the nerve to say that to her 😒 i know yall reading these comments
Blue hoody has no chill.
"They are eating cats, dogs, duck and protected Canadian Geese!!!"
"An AR-15 isn&#39;t a machine gun, the &quot;veteran&quot; did not use an AR-15 overseas (we use M4s), and it isn&#39;t used in most school shootings (the media calls every rifle an AR-15 style rifle).  Where&#39;s the fact check on this?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1407"">23:27</a> blue sweatshirt guy won’t let anyone talk without steam rolling them but as soon as a black woman does she needs to take it down a notch  ?? where is media training for moderators? asking for jubilee"

In this video there was no middle ground it was the Sleepy people want to get the point across just to interrupt people did not have sex while she was she was trying to be da of California
"The Central Park 5 were children, they were coerced into confessing, and they has no representation or parents present! Come again the Facts!"
"An immediate problem I&#39;ve noticed, is that most of the Harris supporters (shown in this video) react with their emotions on their sleeves ever single time they don&#39;t agree with the other side. there&#39;s nothing wrong with not agreeing , but at least give the others the courtesy to finish a thought out before you want to blurt out your response."
"Mason seemed like the only guy that is willing to actually have a conversation on the democrat side.  None of them are gonna change sides on this show.  But he was embarrassed about his colleagues, you could tell."
"How is it that these debates always go the same way? One side is calm, respectful, and bring facts to the table, the other side is angry, emotional, and resorts to personal attacks. I&#39;ll let you all figure out who&#39;s who..."
"Who&#39;s this like group of people coming in and knocking and banging down ya&#39;lls doors?  What are you doing to bring that in your life, A? And B, if you didn&#39;t need AR15 -- you&#39;re talking to a veteran, okay?  I didn&#39;t really need to walk around with an AR -- veteran who built bombs... bla blah&quot;....  So basically she&#39;s saying I&#39;ve never been in that situation, so nobody else has either.  Move to Las Vegas, move to Californian.... have someone rob you while you&#39;re home."
"Anybody else notice scarf lady said she was both a medical practitioner that sees migrants with maps  and also a plastic surgeon who sees kids who want to transition? I don&#39;t know if I trust that lady&#39;s surgical hands, she can&#39;t even keep her story straight."
Ok tbh can we at least all agree that Eric is really annoying and took away from what could have been a beneficial and effective conversation/debate for both sides. Also I really didn’t appreciate the overlap from Kamala’s side. The only people I really cared to listen too on that side where the people on the ends.
"Ppl with no children, don’t own a home or  business, and are under 25 should have a half vote 🤣🤣😂😂 their perspective of the world is a mess"
I find it interesting how the world over citizens obsess over what leaders say and completely color over what they do
It&#39;s a fact that the former Governor of Virginia&#39;s proposal was assuming abortion up until birth and his comment was that the baby would be kept comfortable until the parents &quot;decided what to do with it&quot;.
They looked for any way to be offended. Freakin’ about how Kamala’s name is pronounced 😂. Happy she didn’t give into them.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1980"">33:00</a> Slippery slope fallacy. I personally don&#39;t mind if assault rifles are legal to those without red flags or violent crime history. But saying they will outlaw every gun isn&#39;t a valid argument."
"Can&#39;t go after her accomplishments, all of them handed to her. Her policy is not impeccable, she doesn&#39;t even have a policy it&#39;s so radicalized he can&#39;t talk about it."
"Blue hoodie and Zion were painful to listen to, just the worst takes, every garbage talking point. As delusional as the stuff I see on Reddit."
Holy F.. who is going to pay for all those benefits. I am not going to pay for it. Your money is your money not governments.
Anyone that hears a word and outwardly tells anyone that they are offended by the word need to hide under blankets for the rest of their life.
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1366"">22:46</a> &quot;16 million illegal immigrants are already here! &quot; - &quot;And how is this affecting you?&quot; ... Huh? Are you for real?"
I like how everyone on the panel was just pretending like &quot;machine guns&quot; are legal in the US. Wow. Smart group you got there. 🤦‍♂️
That brown young lady has a lot of growing up and realizations she is going to have…
For you to not be taxed you have to make under 13k… you can definitely make more than 13k a year in many tip based service jobs.
The moderator allowed the guy in Blue to talk to much and his rhetoric was based off of emotions and not facts.
Why would yall single out the black woman when literally EVERYONE was over talking one another. The moderator being micro-aggressive is actually insane
I recommend inviting a big security guy every time you invite that Philippino guy. The guy&#39;s too angry.
Doesn’t everyone in these middle ground videos talk over and yell over other people? Jubliee why do u seem to care now?
"Trumps policy, sell $100k watches 2 months before the election. Wtf."
11 minutes in and they didn&#39;t talk about anything. Can&#39;t waste anymore time. I was actually trying to learn
He didn&#39;t bankrupt the casinos the General Manages mismanaged and caused them to go bankrupt. It&#39;s very expensive to operate and if you just don&#39;t have the volume you&#39;re going to go bankrupt.
Im filipino but That filipino guy runs his mouth like he knows what his talking about!
Bro in the blue hoddie has been drinking that MSNBC cool aid harrdddd 😂
“I’m not yelling “ yea you were hun - when you get loud-you’re yelling
Zion should be removed....shes not fit for civil discussion. Don&#39;t bring her back.
Claims she&#39;s a veteran then called an AR-15 a machine gun 😂😂. Shes a clown
This was a terrible video tbh neither side can agree on one thing or see a middle ground
How this ER physician not advocating for patients regardless of their citizenship.
They need to be fact checked as they go. Embarrassing they still believe media lies
Why would the moderator single her out when everyone is talking??????
Glad to see this comment section isn’t a total mess like some are on Jubilee
California residents would say she was a disaster
Anyone who thinks she has an impeccable record hasn&#39;t looked at her record.
"Zion is so disrespectful, loud AND WRONG! 🤣"
Black woman need to be educated  on politics
"No disrespect to these people, they don’t know what they’re talking about"
Machine guns????? Where ?  They were already banned ages ago
This is America. You single out the black girl for responding the same way as everyone else.
"If these are examples of today’s voters, this country is in trouble."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=519"">8:39</a> --- basically all I heard was &quot;its leviooosa not leviosaaaa&quot; hermoine granger as like let the woman speak ffs"
"She&#39;s a vet, but calls and AR a machine gun 🤣🤦‍♂️"
The mediator in this video needs to let them debate. He sucks
That dude in the blue hoodie definitely still lives with his mother.
Kamala supporters/liberals always take over majority of the conversations with their emotional responses 😩 can we hear both sides equally
W moderator
I hate the whole &quot;I SHOUT OVER YOU THEREFORE I AM TIGHT&quot; crap.
AS WELL IM HISPANIC AND RACIST COMES FROM ALL COLORS OF PEOPLE!
These people are so uninformed and not well researched at all
"Don’t worry bro, not all Filipino voters are like that he/him guy."
Lol &quot;she didn&#39;t lie&quot; &quot;her record is impeccable &quot; so so crazy.
Why are we not talking about Project 2025
They forgot kamala harris been in Congress. What has she done
My lord the Harris supporters are so emotional and angry.
We are being spoon fed lies from both sides.
"I keeping looking for dems that make a sensible, logic-based argument. Its all emotional, brainwashed nonsense. Sure didnt find it in this clip."
The micro agression is crazy
moderator needs to check his bias or they don’t need to be on the show
why does that black girl literally look like that one wojak? lol
The black women was not yelling. Yikes
This Filipino guy is drinking all the koolaid lol
Please do one of these with true undecided voters.
“She came with facts” 😂😂😂😂😂😂. She lied so many times
&quot;America is the greatest country on earth&quot; 🤣🤣🤣
zekiah is kind of delusional and i mean that literally.
The term third world country is offensive to me BRO
I’m a veteran and i support common sense gun reform.
"i hate when the kamala ppl are being annoying and rude like just talk bro, being rude aint helping ur side"
"Why did you only single out the black girl when you can visibly see AND HEAR other people yelling, too???? Very disappointing, Jubliee. The micro aggression was very loud."
bro I just realized that guy had no fingres.
"Lmbo at all of the incoming comments about the “micro aggression”. Give me a break. She and the Filipino guy were very rude. If the moderator was so racist, why didn’t he have to reprimand the BW in the blazer or the BM on the other side?"
the moderator only singling out the black woman…i know what you are.
Can we just get down and who ever falls down loses
That gay dude in the blue hoodie is super beta.
This episode is going to leave on violence
Yup Trumpers are still trumpers
"Im filipino, and we do eat dogs and cats ...😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1407"">23:27</a> so what’s up with EVERYONE ELSE yelling like hello ??? the fact that he did that on camera ?? way too comfortable with that sort of behavior"
"Every jubilee video just rubs me the wrong way, I hate the double standards with women and it was disgusting that the moderator singling out the black woman like she was the only person yelling is crazy to me"
Just came here to say the way the moderator behaves is exactly why I don’t watch this channel
as somone from louisiana we don&#39;t claim that girl
What is Mr. Justin Trudeau doing here 😅
"The way she wasn’t yelling and just talking like EVERYONE else was at the same time. Like why single out a black wonan when everyone was doing that, you’re racist with your damn microagression."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=2193"">36:33</a> this girl lied most of the video, yikes"
That 1 dude said ill be ok I&#39;m white smh
I am Mexican am voting for trump2024 that debate Kamala never said how she will make it better all she say is the same thing that she came from a low class but was getting pimp from a governor back in the day
why are the Harris supporters so pressed?
1 hour of brainrot is crazy
The harris team lost this one smfh.
I wanna see more of Mason he has a very level thought process.
Why did the moderator only address and stop  the black young lady who responded to a question? He didn&#39;t  address anyone else. He should NEVER moderate  again. His BIAS is showing. Disgusting  to see and Jubilee you should do better this is ridiculously cringe and bigoted to see
I can’t listen to this anymore. Honestly bring people that are knowledgeable please.
AR 15 is not an automatic weapon.
These Harris supporters are so ignorant!
Lmao everyone talking about micro aggressions 🤣
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1404"">23:24</a> HAHAHHAHAH she was like &quot;.... bj whose side you on&quot;"
And arguing with the woman’s from Shreveport about guns is ridiculous 😂
Jubilee find a different mod. quickly. QUICKLYYYYYY.
WHAT???? Kamal Harris book is impeccable????
Facts over Feelings ✊🏽
الله يعز السعودية
I feel like they bring these type of individuals on purpose
The guy in the blue … smh 😂
try voters and non-voters
Dude in the light blue hoodie is so irritating.
Zion is a menace
these should be live😭
The border bill was on the table over a year ago.
Unreal.
"Mason, my goat."
I love this debate everyone had a valid points.
This is a debate recap? 😂
That &quot;Physician&quot; is a horrible human beign.
"Zion at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=502"">8:22</a>: “ it’s KA-ma-la” <br>Zion at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=2188"">36:28</a>: “ka-MA-la” 😂<br><br>Also shoutout to John for being completely calm and impartial."
Anyone&#39;s opinions changed after this video?
"The Philippino doesn&#39;t even know what a Historian is LoL....but then again, I don&#39;t expect his kind to really use logic and common sense."
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Most civil political discussion in America
Fact check. Her website had many policies as well as chips act connections for small business as early as 2024 January. She also had policies from 2023 in 2023. She was not selling shirts except for her fundraising site which is different.
That Philipino dude is unbearable I can barely watch the video
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=115"">1:55</a> I find it odd that Jubilee let this guy spew some completely wrong garbage about January 6th without showing a fact check"
&quot;would you say all HAMAS supporters are democats?&quot;
"Fact check: impact of the economics of a presidency generally take 2-3 to flex into place and have impact. Both parts are related to product development supply chains and the speed of government to change. The US is like an aircraft carrier. Land, sea, air and water are all connected to these small cities in the water. To move them is heavily orchestrated and takes several weeks to ensure all protections for all areas are in sync. America is a lot like that. People from other countries have a hard time wrapping their head around just how big we are when they get here. They often wonder how we manage it all with government. The sheer size compared to any other government is impressive. But that means policy changes are not felt for about two years. And some policies stay in place regardless of the administrations want to change them."
Why do people care about the president when it’s the governors that have the power to change your life?
Libs in their feelings LOL. Emotion vs logic.
I love hearing the abortion arguments understand under the same logic weed should be illegal and crime because daddy government said it’s not up to the states . Cute
"i really love jubilee, but the micro aggressions are REALLY NOT needed! people yell over each other all the time in these debates but let’s exclude the BLACK WOMAN who’s using her voice firmly and tell her to pretty much “ calm down” . DISGUSTING and it’s behavior like that where in cases we do have to be more firm in what we say because yall think that whenever a black woman has something to say and it may not align with what you think personal that they’re yelling or angry &amp; THAT is the stereotypical angry black woman comment."
almost a whole half of these people are actual NPC bots
The level-headed vs the people who interrupt everyone😅
"As a veteran and deployed twice...... I need to see this chicks DD-214......... if you know, you know."
"Damn , our country is screwed!"
Jubilee count your freaking days. don&#39;t make this type of content if you&#39;re going to allow people to be walked over and then only single out a black woman for &quot;yelling&quot; tuh.
"As a Filipino, the Filipino dude embarrasses the whole Filipino. You’re something else bro."
bro this video is unwatchable with the moderator cutting off EVERY IMPORTANT DEBATE
Osiris is well spoken and composed🦾
As A Filipino......the guy in blue......HE AIN&#39;T IT!!!
Zion baby girl stating facts isn’t called painting someone as anything THEYRE FACTS
Kamala doesn’t contradict herself? <br>“how dare we speak merry christmas” <br>“merry christmas everyone”<br><br>js saying🤷🏼‍♀️
"I&#39;m from Shreveport, and the girl doesn&#39;t know anything. You better have something walking around..."
erick is very passionate................
The condescending attitude from Zion and Erick is absolutely infuriating
The host kept cutting the blck girl off! She wasn’t even yelling
For anyone watching this.. like reallllyyy watching this.. as a tip.. pause the video.. and really read those fact checks.. take them in.. comprehend them..
"Never fails - every episode - conservatives, calm, rational discussion - leftis  -screaming, rolling eyes, personal attacks. Every.. single.. episode"
I&#39;m 30 min into the video ... can someone from the Harris side explain the &quot;depopulation&quot; ???
I feel like it’s not offensive to say a country that has “dirt cookies” as a cultural food is 3rd world… when you see footage from that country of people cooking other people and eating them… it just seems like they might not be developed…
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=2782"">46:22</a> actual racism today barely exists. Red Summer is racism. You can see who’s got victim mentality"

I’m totally undecided… we seen them both in action. The cause and effect of both policies. Don’t like him… don’t really trust her… just my inner feelings…
Finding no data on Kamala and working at McDonald&#39;s... but trumps the lier
“And pointing out the ridiculous things he was saying”<br><br>You mean gaslighting? Okay.
Guy with the blue hoodie and the black girl are the problems. Really making this unwatchable.
Ground News is probably more reliable for the same service as you advertised
blue sweatshirt guy can only speak in slogans and shallow platitudes.
The light blue guy was crying the entire episode.... He prob had an extra soy frap from Starbucks before this.. the soy is strong in this one
That girl made a great point about the pandemic making us (people in the younger generation) SEE how politicians decisions do affect us
"People are so incredibly ignorant, you do not tear down history, we need to know and have reminders of the many failures that took place on our recent and distant past so ThaT  WE DO NOT REPEAT  THEM DUH GENIUSES"

You could erase blue sweater guy from this video and you wouldn’t be removing anything of value from this video.
"“It’s been happening since the beginning of America” we used to have quotas, actually"
Why was machine gun not fact checked? An AR15 is a semi auto like 90% of all of modern guns

The &quot;vet&quot; calling a ar15 a machine gun. Really? Automatic and semi are different.  You need a very special license  for a Automatic firearm. Did she pass basic?

Harris 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙🇺🇲 all the way she hoing win
This cements my thought that society is and needs to collapse. We have reached an intellectual culdesac.
Harris supporters are annoying! Esp the guy wearing the blue hoodie! Not watching until end!
So after seeing how the moderator treated Zion and only pointing her out for yelling Jubilee has lost it. Unsubbing and blocking.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1980"">33:00</a> this woman is a practicing medical physician?? I sincerely question whether she abides “do no harm” by this point of the discussions. To deny a literal global pandemic and vaccine that her candidate took credit on (and he himself took), is harmful as a medical professional."
Zion wants to speak for Harris just state what you want say insted of defending her on everything someone says against her.
Not being able to admit that there are extremists on both sides is insane. Imagine feeling that you are so correct in your beliefs that you are unwilling to acknowledge that there are other people with the same beliefs that take it too far.
I think my one gripe with Jubilee is that when they bring one side in to chat they don&#39;t tell that one side to leave to give the other side their respect to chat their points. I think they should give each side their respected times and then after they make their points both sides could come together and debate on points. which would help to keep the topic on track without distractions.
It&#39;s super disingenuous to say that you dont know what a candidate&#39;s policies are. They are easily accessible to the public. If you don&#39;t see them It&#39;s because you don&#39;t want to see them so you can keep going back to your talking points that the policies don&#39;t even exist.
"I enjoy the concept of these videos, but it seems like the &quot;winner&quot; of the argument is the person who is better at debating. Lots of tactics to catch the other person slipping; often talking over the other, asking classic strawman arguments, etc. It seems like the focus of the debate devolves into who can win the debate, not who has the stronger points.<br><br>Would love to see the 1 conservative in this video debate the 1 liberal in the other video."
The dems need to do some research before having debates lmao that liberal dude needs to look up the definition of third world country. He wasnt saying they are not human smart guy 🤦🏻‍♀️. The fact that 3 of the dems said they would vote dem no matter what their candidate does says A LOT. I am sooooo glad i am no longer part of that party
These are not the only two options out there. You deserve better. A third party vote or a write in means more than sticking to the two party system. Don&#39;t believe the lie that it&#39;s a wasted vote. It&#39;s just not true. Send a message and move away from the two party system.
I hate when people say “it sucks these are the only two choices.”. We did have more choices it’s called primary election. They lost these two won the position!!! Well except Kamala she was just put in there 😂<br><br>Also The lady in the blue sweater is way too emotional. Settle down buttercup
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1531"">25:31</a> well sir why is it cool to give a tax break to those rich ppl that you work for but still charge you real taxes to pay for things that only a few rich ppl could knockout without losing a wink of sleep?"
I would like a journalist to ask about the covering up of Joes mental state everyone on his staff including kamala had to have easily noticed it and covered for him.
"They didn&#39;t need to fact check her in the debate because she told the truth???  What about when she said there were no service men or women deployed in any war-zone anywhere in the world?  Tell that to all the soldiers currently deployed on foreign soil and their families, but she wants to be commander-in-chief."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=3153"">52:33</a> The corruption in financial institutions is the biggest problem in our country. This Kamala dude with the beard is ok with just not voting for someone outside of the two leading candidates that are completely contributing to the problem in his opinion. This is why we get the candidates we get. Have some balls."
"I’ve watched a lot of these videos, and I wish Jubilee would start asking questions that were not so obvious how people will respond. We would learn and come together so much more"
Z helped us out the other one made us look bad getting told to not scream over ppl like show them we can talk without being so threatening an loud sis damn it’s not that hard
The people that come on here have barely have a clue what they’re talking about and don’t know how to argue their points. It’s annoying to watch these sometimes….
"Let&#39;s talk about  the general  Lee statue . These democrats  say that that they  want to get rid of the statue  because  it Represents slavery an they are offend. So why don&#39;t  they  get rid  of the democratic  party  completely  , didn&#39;t  there party  have slaves  an vote against   Lincoln ( Which he is a  republican ) who wanted  to free the slave&#39;s. That statue  needs to stay, it&#39;s history  if you don&#39;t like it don&#39;t look at it don&#39;t go see it or go see it an teach the kids or people  that hey this was a general  ( Which  General  Lee was a democrat)  an teach the kids or people  that  slavery  was bad."
Need a more neutral moderator. It’s sad they can’t just debate among themselves because one side constantly flashes out &amp; has no respect for the conversation and actual debate
"Kamala Harris was invited to speak at the grand opening of the &quot;National Salad Convention,&quot; where lettuce, spinach, and croutons were the stars of the show. As she approached the podium, she smiled confidently and began her speech.<br><br>&quot;Salads, much like our nation&#39;s future, are made of many ingredients. And those ingredients, when tossed together, become... well, more than just ingredients. They become something larger. They become a salad. And this salad, in its togetherness, is a representation of the togetherness we need. Because lettuce is not just lettuce... it&#39;s a leaf. And a leaf, much like life, grows... from a seed. And what is a seed if not the beginning of a salad? And that&#39;s the journey we&#39;re all on.&quot;<br><br>The audience blinked. Was she talking about salads or world peace? No one was sure. Someone in the back held up a piece of romaine as if it would somehow help clarify.<br><br>Kamala continued, &quot;When we think about croutons, we have to ask ourselves... are they just bread, or are they a statement? A statement of... crunch. And we all need that crunch in our lives. And sometimes, when we&#39;re looking for the dressing—whether it&#39;s ranch or, you know, a vinaigrette—we must remember that it&#39;s the dressing that... dresses the salad. It’s the connection that connects us all.&quot;<br><br>By the end, the crowd wasn’t sure if they should toss their salads or start a revolution. Either way, Kamala had made one thing clear: salads were now the new metaphor for everything."
"It’s so sad people use words like “we” when talking about our political parties. We should be very careful about attaching our identity to either side…. We can talk about ideas but none of these politicians are on our side, they are not on our team no matter what side you support. Support ideas, but don’t attach your identity to it using words like we and our side and especially not “I am republican/democrat”"
To do this correctly you need to show both sides the opposite side of the coin show them how media cuts and paste interviews and or use small pieces of video to get ther points across.......
Proud that some of the younger generation are participating in these types of talks however it’s obvious to see that they have not lived long enough to do so. Instead of hearing what they think about the topics it’s more about how they FEEL
She’s a vet and still can’t tell the difference between and AR-15 and a “machine gun”? you don’t need to be talking. It helps in the “hood” but it’s not for that it’s for a Tyrannical government. Plan and simple. More kids died in crosswalks last year than they did an all mass shootings combine. Guess we have to ban crosswalks.
All I see is people making the mistake of attaching their personal identity to a political party and so an attack on the policy is seen as personal attack…. It’s so sad
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1430"">23:50</a> Thank YOU Moderator. I was about to shut it off because I could hear nothing but loud voices trying to talk over one another. I love to see and hear both sides of the isle, to gain a glimpse of both perspectives, but It’s impossible to do this all at once. Each person must have a turn &amp; allow them to be fully heard. Then someone else may speak. <br>I stopped watching the news channels that have several commentators on at once because of this very thing. It’s not cute. It’s most frustrating. Just sayin. 🤷🏻‍♀️😎👍🏻🇺🇸"
Is that girl just gonna keep yapping about kamala sleeping around like the last vid or actually try to say something try to defend her side in this video
I would love to see all parties dissolved.  We the people have put them in office. They are there for us not the parties.
US politics is like a reality TV show. I’m completely hooked and I don’t even live in the US. No other country drags out election campaigns out for months and months and spends obscene amounts of money like this.
"It’s amazing that the immigrants are speaking against immigrants being let into the country, as if they are any better"
And that’s the problem. Every four years you have to pick up the pieces from the last person. Hence why democracy just splits a nation rather than bring it together
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=170"">2:50</a> &quot;Did you know that this is the lowest civilian to combatants death rate in any war in recent history&quot;<br>I laughed so hard I had to replay this few times looking at her straight face :D :D :D :D :D"
"As someone born and raised in the Philippines, I see the term &quot;third world&quot; as a testament to my resilience and gratitude. I always brag about being from a third world country, because it implies resourcefulness and finding joy in simple things. To me, the term isn’t offensive. It may resonate differently for those who haven’t lived in such contexts (eg: the guy in the blue hoodie). Their experiences in a first-world country unfortunately might not fully capture the richness of what &quot;third world&quot; represents."
All this people are failing to realize that non of these politicians give a damn about them instead of fighting each other and defending these people you should be uniting and challenging the politicians.
"Moderator was bias. It’s interesting that the guy in the blue hoodie was yelling the most but he stood up like a teacher talking to a child to check the black woman. My political beliefs aside, I heard decent points on both side but this debate sucked overall"
"I wish people would stop saying an AR-15 is a machine gun, or an assault rifle, or an automatic weapon, or a weapon of war. All of those terms are inaccurate. It’s a semiautomatic just like a handgun. They want all of our guns"
I want to know where the fact check is that you can&#39;t walk around with a machine gun 99% of going owners don&#39;t own a machine gun. Fully automatic rifles is not common in the civilian population.
"If they have a house, they don&#39;t need the aid to get a house. But the real estate rules state that if you &quot;OWNED&quot; a home and it has been five years since you have owned a home, the law places you in the bracket of &quot;first time home buyers&quot;. That is law."
"Don’t feel bad, China and Russia are still second world countries. There’s nothing wrong with being a Third World country and has nothing to do with your race."
The host of the crappy job people wanted to hear what people had to say he tried to control the narrative we need to allow people to deal with the issues
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=3097"">51:37</a> Osiris says first time homebuyer funds don&#39;t help people who were victims of predatory lending in 2008 because they already owned a home. People who lose their homes become first time homebuyers again after 2 years of non homeownership."
The inability of blue jacket and blue hoodie combo to see other sides of arguments is really the issue with people in general. We’ve lost the ability to be empathetic.
"Sheila saying minors can start gender transition without parental consent is extremely misleading. The fact check shows it&#39;s about not &#39;outing&#39; kids to their parents, not medical plastic surgery procedures like she implied. She knows that&#39;s not true and is using her status as a physican to spread falsehoods."
"The opportunity was when a completed border wall was proposed and Dems said no need.  Enough of this, no other country just lets anyone go through and hands those crossing with money, food, and apartments."
"The veteran knows absolutely nothing about firearms. If you make it through 4 years in the military and still don&#39;t understand that an AR isn&#39;t an automatic rifle, she clearly has a pretty shallow learning curve and I wouldn&#39;t trust a word she says."
the difference in Trumps comments on Roe was that he was talking about legislation and his own personal opinion (which does not always align with direction of country) - to me that is a true mark of a US president
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=813"">13:33</a> says he has no problem with people coming here legally through the process…<br><br>….then proceeds to complain and disagree about said people coming over legally through the process ? 😂  😭"
Literally everyone was yelling over each other and in past videos you&#39;ve let people yell over eachother why call out the African american woman specifically?
It&#39;s true there&#39;s video evidence of abortionists and politicians and regular people who have said that abortions can happen up to and after birth.
The proposed border bill was just a small slow down and still allowed 5K a day which just makes those at border to wait an extra day or two until they all get released!!
ITIN is the name the IRS for illegal inmigrantes all in the USA need pay taxes inclusive if you are illegal if not you cant fix your situation migrant
"Zion is annoying. that girl probably has nothing but time lol she sure as anything isnt wasting time learning, just nodding her head any chance she gets"
The gaslighting is hilarious from harris supporters and there is no policy  but main point they didn’t even agree to the lack of a fact check already bad faith clicking off 🙏🏻😊
No…millions of immigrants came here historically documented through points of entry. What is currently happening isn’t happened since…I guess Europeans colonized and pushed the natives out lol
The guy in the blue sweatshirt is very emotional and trying to pass his opinions as factual. The guy in red hat is logical thinker.
Both candidates are crap.  To say his rhetoric is ok is a problem and to say her record is impeccable and pandering is acceptable is a problem
„If I wasn’t born in America I would do the exact same thing as immigrants because we really hit the lottery here” <br>People in Europe watching this like :💀👀
"If your grandparents came into this country as an immigrant, then I feel that you need to keep quiet on the immigration issue. 🤷🏽"
"Only 2 people did mostly the screaming and spoke about feelings and bot facts. Also can&#39;t believe this dude said he&#39;s offended that people call 3rd world countries , 3rd world countries. Also, felt like the mostly edited the Republicans side."
Did she really say that what&#39;s going on in Gaza is NOT a genocide and said it would end 2 days later? does she NOT understand what is really going on in there?
Zion: “ do you know how the industrial prison system works?”<br><br>Zion: “ I support a candidate who actively participated in the industrial prison system… that has nothing to do with her character!” <br><br>Hm?
"Why is that girl in the shorts even there? She provided NOTHING At all! Also, it&#39;s apparent that 90% of these people are clueless. They all just repeat the same things they heard on the media."
next time avoid bringing people like zion and the blue hooded guy to discussions like these bc they let their emotions control em and end up getting so worked up for abs no reason.
&quot;Its hard to go after her record when its impeccable&#39; I cannot believe this woman said that🤣<br>Edit: Half an hour into the video and this African American woman with the suit has the worst opinions
Lmao she has no policy .. she is a horrible lawyer and person .. 😂 wow I mean o wow these people r so brainwashed and they need help
He’s not lying about these people not knowing how to drive😂 my aunts are 60-80 and cousins that are 18 and up and cannot drive! Have you seen traffic in 3rd world countries!😆
"Wait hold on ain’t no way they kinda got offended for the way she pronounced her name, I ain’t even know that was a thing lmaoooo"
"I would love that girl to come live in Chicago and ATL for a year and then tell me her view on guns, because I’ve lived in both."
The veteran girl had to be in the reserves or guard … or just believes she can make 💣 at home bc I don’t understand the lack of knowledge 😅 and the demeanor in which she “argues”
"As soon as Sheila said the civilian death rate in Gaza was the lowest in recent history, I understood watching this video would be a waste of my time."
When the &quot;veteran&quot; said an AR was a machine gun...shows me how much she actually spent with her weapon. She might want to actually learn the difference.
Mason is the only one trying to understand and listen while sticking to his points and I can really respect that
I loved Sheila the most - she was the most well spoken and factual speaker there. I am not gonna even comment on blue hoodie dude
"Ok, I was born in Nigeria and before I came to America I had this idea there would never be equality <br>Any place with diversity will have no equality <br>Fighting who fought a civil to free you is plain evil"
"The people on these shows are very upset.  Whenever someone says, I have mad respect for the others... no, no they dont."
The long haired black girl said it was nobodies business why immigrants went to USA but then questions why people feel they need to defend themselves. Very inconsistent
"supporting a gun ban as a veteran is the craziest thing ive ever heard a veteran say, and im a veteran!"
To say no democrats are talking about taking guns is ridiculous. Harris and Walz both have said they are in favor of gun confiscation
Why do they never bring up the fact that there was a semiautomatic weapons ban from 1994-2004 clearly allowing AR-15’s was not a wise decision
I&#39;d like to see a panel of people like me who are disgusted with both sides AND the two party system from a fundamental level.
"Really need to make a video with Dr Jill Stein’s supporters as well, i know its not a big enough phenomenon but I’m hoping to see most logical answers from them"
Why does nobody bring up the fact that the immigration bill that was voted no on is a democrat wishlist? PUT FORWARD A STAND ALONE BILL AND MAYBE WE WILL PASS IT
"Wait, wait, wait, Tr*mp said at the debate that he still believes the Central Park 5 are guilty."
girl with the glasses was in the plastic surgery video..but she&#39;s saying she works in a county hospital? Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong but aren&#39;t those two different things?
The girl in the jumpsuit is so condescending i can’t take it. Every time she opens her mouth she had an attitude smh 🤦🏻‍♀️
"n the 1960s and 1970s, America was or was at-least VERY CLOSE to being #1 in education. The Department of Education was established roughly 4 decades ago. We are now in the 40s in terms of Education. LET THAT SINK IN."
"Moderator should pick 1 person from each side to debate. Do a tag team like wrestling, one person talking at a time."
"First Generation home buyers, so if your parents or grandparents owned a house then you dont get it."
bull on the  only8 million.   they ignore the ones coming in from canada  and the ones over staying visas
"As a non American, it&#39;s eye opening to see how the Harris supporters blindly follow her but can&#39;t name a single achievement of hers as vice president."
can we take care care of our infrastructure and our veterans instead of sending billions of dollars to israel.
"The woman is a plastic surgeon talking about gender surgeries, a highly credible source, and the Philippino guy is just rolling his eyes."
"As a server, I owe $1,500-2,000 every year in taxes when tax season comes around, so I have no idea where Mason got that idea at"
When asked about Harris’ policies…it’s promises as opposed to actual policies that go over how those promises would be kept
If she says I&#39;m from Iran one more time. My goodness we get it and I pray for the hospital or clinics she works for.
Filipinos do eat dogs tho. It’s called Adobo. In the US they usually use pork. But I’ve seen and heard of them eating them. I’m from Hawaii.
"Erick has to be the biggest baiter, gaslighter, and arrogant mfr I’ve ever seen on this channel."
Ohhhh that&#39;s where I know the Doctor lady from. She is that famous Beverly Hills doctor Sheila Nazarian. Once she said plastic surgeon I recognized her
No issue being homosexual but this is so clear- he isn&#39;t here for political issue but make you believe that gay black men are mega??
Did i really hear the women say its not a genocide whats happening in gaza ? I think she should change her glasses
That Filipino dude literally said “Amen” to the lady saying as a queer black woman she feel safe under Kamala. What’s there to Amen?
"this fool, she doesnt even realize that most shootings that occur are with handguns and shotguns not ARs"
You guys ever question WHY we have these two choices? It feels like people WANT us to fight and pretend it&#39;s an easy choice.
"That lady that works on healthcare is actually a danger; her moral compass is off, and so much more red flags!"
These Kamala people get so offended and loud lol
It’s really crazy these people act like they need weapons of war to protect their homes lol.
"so much for a thriving superpower country, we have so many economic issues…something’s not adding up🤔"
The guy in blue hoodie is a clown “the term 3rd world country is offensive to me” what a clown
"Some of the others were great, this was awful. Uneducated, bad debaters everywhere here"
How about putting up the status of the people that ran her out of Iran and says it&#39;s history
I love that the first thing i hear is Jan 6th. It is the ignorants first line of defense.
These black ppl are just going to talk over you instead of listening like everyone else.
Nah these Biden supporters is outta pocket 😂😂💀.  Zakiah is the only smart one in that group
It&#39;s kinda fun when you&#39;re not a strong party loyalist to watch party loyalists debate eachother.
The girl next to the Pilipino guy is beautiful but just confused like a lot of dems
"You should redo this video, but with illegal immigrants. So we can have all laugh"
The girl that said her AR 15 is a machine gun which it is not. She was in the military. I would need proof.
please dont take the woman with the braid ever in the show again she is so problematic
Guy in blue hoodie is your typical Kamala voter 😂
People should be able to keep guns. As ironically as it sounds it does keep us safer.
I hate listening to the media lies repeated over and over. Its sickening.
It’s when he said she was yelling and wanted to end it for me when she wasn’t lol. Smh
When was America the best country in the world? 😅
The beginning of this got me heated already and I haven’t even gotten to 20 seconds 😂
We(Filipinos/chicagoans) do not claim home boy in the Chicago hoodie lol
This is a WEAK panel on both side. The dude in th blue sweater is the LEAST informed.
"how do i sneak into the pool of people they pick from, jubilee ain’t ready for me‼️‼️"
"eric has nothing behind his words, just a moving mouth spewing out random words."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1099"">18:19</a> His face when Sheila said they still came legally got him so angry lol"
Zion is mad annoying and agressive bruh. So glad the moderator called her out.
"I live in a city with a high Latino-migrant population, yea a lot of them can’t drive"
Men lead the house hold not woman in every house so why is this different 😂😂😂😂
"Take taxes off of working hours. If I earned that money, I should be able to keep it."
"i&#39;m Filipino, and erick would eat a lechon aso to prove his a hardcore democRAT 🐀."
Glad my fellow down south LA girl held her own. Although this conversation did become tiring…
Moderators are there to calm the situation so it’s better to be unbiased.
Neither side knows enough to even speak on these issues. Who chose these people?😫
"&quot;I wish we had more options&quot; <br>Fool, you do have more options. You can vote for Jill Stein!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1770"">29:30</a> the lady in the blue suit is living under a rock 🪨 talking of Kamala😅"
"Aneila is gorgeous, and looks like a lot of fun, but Sheila is wife material!"
Are they all at least 25? Curious how this would go with older folks.
"We will never agree this is a waste of time, ill see you at the polls"
About to stop watching these bait videos especially with moderators like this…
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1365"">22:45</a> the idea of “if it doesn’t affect you then why do you care” is wild"
SAN can fact check me but I thought the &quot;Great Recession&quot; was a century ago.
",,we know Kamalas character‘‘ <br>she acts like thats her friend 😭"
Who let that girl back on the talk? She’s as bright as a rock 🪨 😂😂😂
I like how the only fact check one side isn’t that amazing even on this
"As someone who is looking in from the outside, America is a sitcom 😂😂"
lol you can’t go after her record because she was a prosecutor? Insane
"Looks like everyone agrees on one thing, dude in blue hoodie is unstable."
"I would like to say as a fellow Filipino, this guy does not represent me"
There is never any middle ground in political stuff on this show
They are both bad canidates. As a independent this will be hilarious.
"60Million really, why does this number keep going up.  Such a joke she is."
"Ponytail guy is way too sensitive , he’s got too much anger."
Erick (blue hoodie guy) making Filipinos look bad. - i am half Filipino
&quot; im a veteran&quot; completely misclassifies ar as a machine gun
I’m filipino and that Filipino guy is annoying. Why is he so worked up?
Not the middle ground guy saying “we can smoke after this” to Erick 😭😭😂
that samoan dude in the light blue sucks lol
"To that black lady, go to a country that ban guns. STOP YOUR LIES"
I can&#39;t get past the black girl shaking her head in ignorance
I love my Filipino brother and sisters but this guy is a clown.
I just wanna take the time out to say Mason outfit was fresh 💯
Bro in the blue never gone back to the Philippines he should
I’m Filipino and we don’t claim that guy in the blue hoodie.
Jubilee why don’t you fact check the blue side as much as
"Whoever said she&#39;s allowed to question her morality is crazy. Just because you yell doesn&#39;t make you more intelligent. People who yell to get their points across indicate low intelligence. Then having the audacity to say, I&#39;m not yelling, lol, okay."
I like how there is some order being kept a little bit more.
"@ej_regalado <br>John, I am chomping at the bit to participate in a debate on this subject. There is way too much pertinent facts that no one ever brings up! How can I drop some knowledge in the circle?"
"“We don’t have to fact check, if we’re telling the truth…” okay"
I cussed Shiela out so many times during this video. 🥴
The guy with the hoodie doesn’t know how con law works
Lesbian in the blazer is feeling Kamala a lil too much😂
There’s always that one instigator &amp; dude knows who he is.
Trumpsplaining  … this is what he was trying to say .
Easy to see which side is snobby and unreasonable
Sometime these &quot;woke&quot; people be acting &quot;asleep&quot; fr. 😂
Of course the Zionist on this show denies genocide lol
"Can you imagine fighting for American rights, and then coming back to tell Americans what they do and don’t need to protect themselves, what a disgrace of a veteran"
Lmfao the way she said “I’m not yelling!” While yelling
that hard hat seems to be a requirement of some sort
"The bill expanded illegal immigration, not ending it"
But why didn&#39;t they fact check the blue hoodie guy?
Girl now u know we can’t get too passionate 😅
not a genocide? girl what
Kamelas record impeccable 😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅
As a veteran..... then calls an AR a machine gun.
I do like that they are being fact checked!
Lol there are videos of her contradicting herself
Bro. They got caught eating the animals!! Wake up
"The lady with the mean tone who says she&#39;s a healthcare worker , should not be working with people at the hospital she sounds untrustworthy"
Look how goofy those Kamala supporters look 😂
U thought harris beat harris take that Hat off
how ur family came here &quot;Legally&quot;? iranina Ma&#39;m?
Lee Paul Williams Kimberly Rodriguez Barbara

Look at the folks on both sides…. Enough said….

Blue hoodie guy wouldn’t let anyone talk smh
Baby blue hoodie was insufferable
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1220"">20:20</a> She nailed it."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1123"">18:43</a> hmm who sucked? That’s crazy"
The first prompt and reaction is so telling.
As they watches fight they just sit and laugh
Fact check reminds me of the 3 against 1 debate
That&#39;s an hour I&#39;ll never get back
Third party voters vs. duopoly devotees
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=2858"">47:38</a> you can clearly see who&#39;s truthful"
How are all of them sharing 1 brain cell
They did not let 16 million people in Afgani!
Light blue was dtm but so was the doctor …
How brainwashed are those peoples
Jubilee os turning into a sh** show
Zekiah is an empty slogan machine.
Politics makes children of us all
arguing feelings vs arguing facts
5.53 when I noticed that dudes hand lol
Guy in the blue hoodie was mad emotional
We need more asylum seekers from Iran please.
Why am I arguing with my screen?
The one way fact checking is crazy.
Ok we understand you’re from Iran
In a local election i would vote for zekiah
These Harris supporters are way too crazy
Colorado Native - i agree it’s not the same
Separation of church and state!
Lots of misinformation on Harris here… smh
Zion and blue hoodie are despicable lol
I never voted but im voting for jill stien
"Damn, Chris Pratt has time to do this show…?"
Omg she is a doctor!!! Goodnesssssss😔
"Moderator on that 🐂 💩 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1403"">23:23</a>"
SHEILA... I&#39;M SORRY. SHUT IT!
Do third party vs Harris supporters.
"Both sides completely missed on major subjects.!   There were so many FACTS that could have been brought up.   I have never watched any of these, do they purposely bring people in that are ignorant of the facts for more views?"
I am so glad they brought in a moderator
"I don’t care for either candidate, but why wouldn’t they stop the liberals  from constantly interrupting"
You don’t need a bill to close the border
Americans 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
They need it to have mexican there
This is complete brainrot
what is recreational gun use??
What kind of fact checking is this?
Zion slow af lord bless her heart
JUBILEE THIS IS DIABOLICAL 😂
I need to smoke a joint after that
I grew up in a middle class family and my golden retriever is smarter than a woke liberal.
moderator ruining the video
He was president for four years. Why didn&#39;t he fix the boarder problem then?
"The host is a female, correct?"
hmm the mediator seems bias
"Well, america is doomed..."
Dude please I can’t even
I hate how they all talk over people
Compared to other groups these people were all relatively sane.
“i’m questioning it” 👏🏽

Garbage fact checks
I don&#39;t like crack
mod look like anwar hadid
The Dems are emotional
everyone is unbearable
Harris has no policies

The lady from Iran is condescending
Babylon is over💀

This is obnoxious
What&#39;s Aniela&#39;s @
What else was in the bill?
"&quot;US as Americans hit the lottery being born here&quot;, this is what they actually believe 🤣🤣🤣"
Emotions vs logic
Mason my goat

He is lying. Those schools in Chicago  were not turned the ones that were closed were. And the ppl fought back
We&#39;re cooked
"HEY that host purposely singled Zion out. Every time she tried to talk he was only telling, or gesturing HER to be quiet or cutting her off. And then he stood up to talk down to her - not okay."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=395"">6:35</a> booohoo"
it was so amazing how that girl was like &quot;lets just get real. when are you ever gonna need an ar&quot; like thats just too true
&quot;If it was a genocide it would have ended like 2 days later&quot; is such an ignorant thing to say.
Let&#39;s go kami Harris 💙👠💙👠💙👠 she represents your grandmother your mother your sister your daughter your granddaughter 🔵🇺🇲💙👠💙👠💙👠💙 blue 💙💙💙💙 is a guarantee of success well-being progress abundance maximum prosperity and innovation for all middle class not only the filthy billionaires America was built on the middle class from the beginning 👠🇺🇲💙
"As far as guns, better to have and not need than to need and not have. That Zion girl must not have seen world war Z 🤣 I’ll be damned! You don’t know what these politicians got up they’re sleeve. All I see is a Trojan horse tbh 🐎"
Closed ears won’t hear
Funny how one side is always yelling and interrupting the other instead of debating with civility. Not just in this particular debate either...
"This Zion girl&#39;s disconnect from reality, is honestly quite concerning."
Dude in the blue sweater was just a wait of a seat.
lol...ANTIFA?
Ugh
"First, the Philippino dude is not as correct as one make think….. THERE ARE MANY PHILIPPINO FRIENDS that I know are doing very well. Nobody that I know would say the things that you are saying. Maybe you have your own personal issues. Calm down brother.  Stop being racist."
Cats
"Yeah. The guy in the blue sweatshirt, pls don&#39;t ever invite him back."
"As a Filipino, we are disowning blue hoodie guy."
Anelia ❤❤
Zion is damn fine
Harris/ Walz 2024 for a sane  and decent 🇺🇸. 💙👍

How do you complain about criminals entering the country while trying to elect one for president
Terrible panel. Both sides.
Handguns are for protection against other citizens.  Rifles and machine guns are for militia or protecting yourself against your own government in the event they have become corrupt.

"There talking about not erasing history,  did the Trumpets forget the bab in books that the Republicans are trying to do ..smfh.. vote Kamala Harris. And one more thing it does matter how her name is pronounced,  I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t want your name to be said wrong 😂"
moderator was ON POINT. I loved this format. This was one of my favorite debates and I was able to actually hear everyone for once lol (Blue hoodie was the only one that I thought was more emotional and not factual.)
"It doesn’t matter how people pronounce Kamala Harris’s name. it’s 🇺🇸. freedom of speech,  if anyone has a problem  with that then they don’t believe in the first amendment."
Notice how the people on trumps side are respectful and reserved in their emotional outbursts.

this is so sad. project 2025 has nothing to do with Trump.I felt this channel is super bias and that makes me sad. I&#39;m unsubscribing and no ;longer supporting this channel. its sad because I really liked it
I live around and have met more immigrants where I currently live.  They have NEVER hurt me or been rude or disrespectful.  They work and are friendly AND the crime where I live is not from Immigrants.
But y’all do eat dogs?
That black lady said &quot;It&#39;s hard to go after her record when she has been impeccable&quot; That girl is high af lol
I lost it at &quot; her record is impeccable&quot;. Life would be easier if i was this  uneducated
TRUMP2024<br>TRUMP2024<br>TRUMP2024. <br>80 Million of us voting in November.
OMG this scares me for the future of our country
Anyone not from America but wasting 1hr watching this<br>👇🏽
I lost it when she defended calling Kamala “kaMAla” as if she’s still correct to pronounce it wrong. I say we just start calling him Donald Tramp until they get the message. Who’s with me.
Did that girl see what Kalama has done in San Francisco?
Kamala 24’💙

Girl is a vet and doesn’t know that an AR-15 style rifle is NOT a machine gun😂
are we not going to talk abt the girl saying that the genocide isnt a genocide???
"Does anybody know the name of the Filipino guy in blue sweatshirt? Kabayan, masyado ka naman emosyonal. Ano ba ipinaglalaban mo? LOL ;-)"
Never have Erik on again lol

"The way the Republican party is so welcoming to, and depends on white supremacists is why I could never support them, but besides that the problem with both sides is that at some point we have to recognize that you never have a winner without having a loser. Whoever wins has to really start going out of thier way to also help the other side, and not leave them out."
They said the same about black people not contributing to this American economy country. Study your history so we will not repeat it. Because we not going back.
"The  difference if  Democrats  spending Government  Money, to help the Poor &amp; middle class.  is this. They Help Pople, &amp; Build infrastructure projects .<br> The Republicans  waste  Government  , money on frivolous things. . &amp; Party a lot with the     Wealthy . &amp;  Fornier&#39;s   ."
I REALLY feel like jubilee purposely structured this video on the Lefts side 😂 i seen too many cut off clips of when someone on the rights turn to talk 👀
Trumpers will literally say anything bruh lol. True or not. It doesn&#39;t matter. As long as whatever they are saying uplifts trumps and puts down everyone else.
"That Zion girl who keeps using her veteran status as some sort of subject matter expert is really annoying to listen to. Let&#39;s be real on her &quot;deployments&quot; she more than likely was never outside the wire. She said she had fewer rights when she came back, haha......please stop that stupidity.  Most of us just say thank you and don&#39;t advertise our service."
Where do ppl buy those little cute hands?! I can&#39;t find then anywhere
"The Border Bill WAS NOT A BORDER SECURITY BILL. Read it. The Bill is for $181 billion, but only $20.2 billion is for the Border. $60 billion goes to Ukraine, $18 billion goes to Israel, $10+ billion goes to foreign aid, and the rest goes to military operations in Africa and special projects by certain members of Congress. The $20.2 Billion for the Border is mostly for administration, legal aid for immigrants, judges, and interviewers to talk with immigrants -- AND ALL OF THEM, the Bill says, CAN NOT BE LAW ENFORCEMENT. So grow up, kids, and stop believing that the major media is telling you all the truth. The young Black girl who said she was a veteran and built bombs and she doesn&#39;t need to walk around with a machine gun --- she is a liar. An AR is not a Machine gun, and if she does not know that --she is clearly a liar."
why should anyone have to contribute their work (healthcare) to people who didn&#39;t contribute to the system?
The lady that works at healthcare really said &quot;These people&quot;? WOW.....
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=922"">15:22</a> Republicans always go on about Vets needing to be taken care of first, but <b>never</b> propose any legislation whatsoever to help Veterans."
"This Zion lady pissing me off referring to an AR-15 only as a machine gun, which are legal to own to any citizen if it was made before May 19, 1986 or if you have the proper FFL. Just felt like I needed to add that before people start chiming in"
"How high would you rate the smugness of the girl condescendingly asking the lady who legally immigrated to the US from Iran how illegal immigration is affecting her, while also complaining about the fact that her own ancestors that she&#39;s never known were slaves 150 years ago?"
The black guy wearing a “make American great again” is the most hilarious thing I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂😂😂

"One side is extremely emotional, passionate yes, however severely misguided in how to conduct a debate or simple conversation in general. The other side has open ears &amp; calmly expresses their thoughts. If both sides could respect the others points and then calmly respond, this could have been the episode of the decade, however, it’s just a show to why America is the way it is rn."
The female &quot;veteran&quot; sounded like she read the comics all day and spouted things in an inane fashion. Check her 9.1 percent claim and then the fact check. My opinions and my take.
"Need to get more informed voters, all 8 of these participants knew very little to nothing about the facts of the last eight years! Very frustrating to watch both side of the argument poorly and unintelligently debated!"
people who say weed is their medicine are ridiculous..
The military &quot;veteran&quot; doesnt know what&#39;s a machine gun
Libtars with emotion and reb with logic 😂
She said that Kamala is impeccable 🤡🤡🤡
working class isn&#39;t voting for Harris....
I can’t stand Harris and her supporters

This is unprecedented levels of perfection how.
Ain&#39;t even a furry but I got such mad respect for the animating skill LupisVulpes displayed and that displayed by everyone they inspired.

"I love this! I looked at the song and the artist, and now I have an album I really like, too! Now that I&#39;ve heard the full song I can tell where the audio cuts and it takes away from the video a little bit, but it&#39;s still adorable as heck.

This song gets stuck in my head all day
"With the fact that most frames had to be individually drawn, I am REALLY impressed with the effort! This is not something you see on a regular basis, and that&#39;s the amazing bit!"

Ngl this video is probably how I started watching furry animation type videos. I can’t get over those fluffy tail animations XD
"Wow, that animation! So good. The lip-synching was on point and so smooth, and the characters moved so nimbly but felt like they still had weight to them. Props &lt;3"
The fact this meme is perfectly animated is just ironic-

"It is wonderful! Meme is beautiful and the characters are so cute: 3. You definitely need to like it! Sorry that the words do not match, I&#39;m just Russian, and I do it in a translator ... But the meme is still 👍"
can we talk about how dang smooooooth this animation is?<br>This smoother than japanese cheesecake<br>Also the way the white fox was just like &quot;I am so fed up with this guy&quot; was PRICELESS
I see my supper
"My literal favorite animation meme so far! Amazing job! I love your commissions so much! You always make them so cute and happy, and put way more work than you need to in them! Keep up the great work!"
"I feel like more and more animation memes are becoming wholesome instead of traumatizing their OC&#39;s, and I like that"
"Wow..a month…that is so long. You deserve ten times more recognization then you are given. Not to mention, you probably sat for hours just animating. This is wonderful work- I would give my life to have this kind of patience 😂"
Can you do this but do a black wolf or lynx? Sorry if I&#39;m asking for a lot! Btw it&#39;s amazing :3
"Love this, I watched this about 1000, 00000, 000 times by now but this meme never gets old, just like all of your animations, this is absolutely amazing!<br>👍✨"
Who else wants to pet him? 💀❤️✨
"I sent this to my girlfriend (I&#39;m a girl) she absolutely loves this, we both agree its adorable! Also your art is amazing!"
This is so freakin cuuuute❤
my bff sent me this and i feel very loved
"Q: Is there such a thing as too cute?<br><br>A: No, there will never be too much cute. :3"
This is literally so cute omfg
The fact I saw a fox video before this
I love how they trip. It just adds that little extra touch of attention too many animations miss.
"You can really see the effort put into the animations here, please never stop doing this"
"I love this so much, this literally inspirations me so much. ;3; The characters, the animation flows, and how it fits it all. &gt; 3&lt; Def gonna make a meme out of this, I&#39;ll link to you when it&#39;s done. ♥ P.s new to your channel and I subbed, your characters are so adorable! ♥"
"if there was one video I could watch every minute of my life, it&#39;d be this"
The mouth is perfectly inSync I love it
Title: perfect meme<br>Me: yes it’s a perfectly beautiful meme
"Im going too die from cuteness uwu <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CoNcDTiCKQ&amp;t=30"">0:30</a>"
You inspired me a bit ago and now im a full time animation creator
I REMEMBER WATCHING THIS WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT! TIME FLIES BY SO FAST
Its been a long time since I’ve seen this meme
perfect
"ES HERMOSO, la animación es perfecta, la música, el video es perfecto 🥺"
Holy smokes did a familiar face just popped up in my recommendations-<br>Duuuude I used to follow you a couple years ago when I was having an animation meme phase and geezus...how much you’ve improved sense then is inSANE<br>I can’t stop rewatching this it’s blowing my mind
"WAAHHHH, SORRY I&#39;M LATE, THIS IS SO ADORABLE"
I was reading pax at the time I saw this and I feel like it kinda reminds me of pax!
This is so cute
This is UNREASONABLY well-animated.
"It&#39;s a furry canal?<br>Okay, I like furry.<br>I admit that I like furry, without offending. This is the first furry channel that I am going to follow, and I will never show it because all my friends hate furry, call me weird, although I am for my friends, Even if I speak Spanish, I understand English and I know how to write in this language.<br>Inside I love furry<br>Vinkelext"
"My ahh who can’t animate for the life of me (I can animate, I’m just awful at it) who can only dream about doing this: 👁️👄👁️"
"I could watch this for hours and hours, this is an amazing video condensed into 50 seconds, and an inspiration for what I hope I can pull off one day. truly an amazing video."
I like the part where sam cuts of the foxs arm with his mursama
"I searched up sad music, and this showed up-???"
This was the first animation meme that I ever saw and it got me into the community.<br><br>So nostalgic!
THERE WILL BE BLOOD
"the animation is so smooth..<br><br>wait HEY, NO IM NOT CRYING BECAUSE OF HOW GOOD THIS IS YOU DIDNT SEE THAT"
"Truly amazing,I love how smooth and  bouncy the animation is"
Standing here                                                                                                                                           <br>I realize<br>You are just like me<br>Trying to make history<br>But who’s to judge<br>The right from wrong<br>When our guard is down<br>I think we’ll both agree<br>That violence breeds violence<br>But in the end it has to be this way<br>I’ve carved my own path<br>You followed your wrath<br>But maybe we’re both the same<br>The world has turned<br>And so many have burned<br>But nobody is to blame<br>Yet staring across this barren wasted land<br>I feel new life will be born<br>Beneath the blood stained sand<br>Beneath the blood stained sand
I love this so much. I can’t not watch it whenever I see it recommended to me.
I love everything about it the editing and the meme itself the song just goes well with the animation and I think it’s really nice😊
It’s a masterpiece
Friend: “How many times have you watched this?”<br>Me: “yes”
Now that’s a pretty meme! Exquisite!
"Best animation ever, I&#39;m literally putting this on loop.<br><br>its just PERFECT"
The lil ear movements are EVERYTHINGGGG ❤
I could definitely say that this animation really matches the name!
"&quot;It&#39;s beautiful, i&#39;ve been looking at this for 5 hours now&quot;<br><b>me rn</b>"
"I saw this video when I was sick a year ago, I had a very bad stomach ache and they thought it was appendicitis, but in reality it was just anxiety, and I started scrolling YouTube to distract myself and the first video that came out was this &lt;3 were three in the morning and then it became one of my favorite animations &lt;3"
Literally my favorite animal<br>If i was a furry a fox would be my oc
"I have watched this a lot of times, and it’s adorable! PLEASE continue working. Even if I’m not subscribed, I love your work!"
expressions and lipsync are phenomenal it makes me want to cryyyy 😭 also the most buttery smooth animation I&#39;ve eva seen
"every time I open up YouTube this is on my recommendation list, but to be honest, I don&#39;t mind at all. this animation is to wholesome to say no to. Will forever brighten up mah day for eternity and all the journeys into the bottomless pit. YouTube you better not delete this animation later on in life or I&#39;ll Smite you. Never ruin the happiness this animation brings to everyone and to me especially."
How many times have you watched this?:<br><br>Me:YES
Can we just notice the art style and the quality! A lot of memes are good but don&#39;t look good but this is good enough for a number 1 on trending!
Ok this oc is so Frickin adorable
Это шедевр.
I still wach thus on 2024

"Im a polytherian and one of my theriotypes are red fox and lemme just say....<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>THIS IS PERFECT OANDAJWJNDJS *£,÷÷,× NEW SUB"
I just keep coming back to this video and by the view count it seems I’m not the only one

I love how this one is more popular than the original 💕
I think you missed a call from Disney
I definitely see the time and effort into this the animation is perfect
Nice work! The animation is so smooth and I love the facial expressions. Also the design for the fox is really cute!
This is just.... Perfect.
I can’t find it on Spotify someone help me please
THE ANIMATION STYLE IS LITERALLY ADORABLE I LOVE IT SO MUCH
"Ive been watching this every time I get tired and take a break from my work, I recently got dumped and this is the last good memory I had with them, listening to this song. It&#39;s a bittersweet feeling."
this is exactly what people should send to their friends-
this is literally the only video I’ve seen that u have made and I’m subbing already
"This is amazing, the detail and how it’s just put together! Those people who disliked don’t know your hard work."
"I just came across this video and I’m so glad I did! Absolutely love this animation style and have been watching it whenever I can for the past week, truly an amazing video!"
Im screaming at how good this is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I have exclamation marks for days ÙwÚ
1 year ago in summer I would always watch this at night and this was the time I was introduced to animation memes I loved it so much and still do
"&quot;Perfect, perfect! Never seen a thing just like you!&quot;"
"It looks like my Roblox skin and I&#39;m a YouTuber if it&#39;s me, thanks :)"
This is the video that got me by surprise and eventually got me interested into the furry fandom. I love this video and I can&#39;t stop dancing when it&#39;s in my head!
just saying im currently watching this on a server with 192gb of ram
okay so can we talk about how smooth the animation is?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CoNcDTiCKQ&amp;t=44"">0:44</a> What a cute horn :3"
"Every animation I&#39;ve seen with that character, they have one of (if not the most) chaotic faces I&#39;ve seen and I&#39;m here for it"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CoNcDTiCKQ&amp;t=39"">0:39</a> 𝙸 𝚑𝚎𝚊𝚛𝚍 &quot;𝙹𝚎𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚎 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚆𝚊𝚕𝚝&quot; 𝚏𝚛𝚘𝚖 𝚋𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚔𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚋𝚊𝚍 🥲😭★☆"
The animation flows so nicely.
The animation.. the character design… this animation meme truly <b>IS perfect</b>
this is it.. this is what i wanna achieve with my own art
Why walk on all fours when you can walk on all four levels of 😈hell😈
maybe being  furry isnt that bad
No father
Ahhh. Who else watches this just to see the walking animation in the begining??  its SO GOOD!!
This is what I was thinking about during period one today💀🤭
"The title was right it is Perfect, no random sketches, no lines out of place, takes the song lyrics to consideration, the art style is awesome, the animation was smooth, and the drawings are just out of this world! It’s awesome! The real question is how long did this take- ❤"
I LOVE THE PART WHERE HE FAILS TO JUMP IT&#39;S SO CUTE SNSBSUSBAHJDHS
"YouTube really knows what I like, got this video 6 times in a row in my recommended."
You don&#39;t have to be a furry like the animating that is good
The expressions are just- and the smoothness—<br><br>….<br>One word.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Perfect.
Whoever sung this did a great job!
I swear this is one of those videos that lives in my head rent free
Sometimes it&#39;s nice to watch these to remind me when times were simpler
how to tell someone you have a crush on them without telling them you have a crush on them:
People in 2024<br>👇
"This is a great, adorable little animation.<br><br>In fact, I think I&#39;d go so far as to say it&#39;s...<br><br><i>Perfect</i>"
Howww do you draw like that?! That&#39;s my DREAM style!!?
"Lol I&#39;m so late to say this, but the animation itself is ✨Perfect ✨"
"warning, your chances of me hugging you have increased from 90 to 100"

Ютуб: о давай это тебе попадётся в реки через 2 года?<br>И это шедевр!
"Fun fact, there’s actually a meaning behind the red string. In Japanese culture we call this 運命の赤い紐(unmeino-akai-himo), which means the red string of faith. This string is a string that is believed to be tied on one of our fingers and the string will eventually lead to another person’s finger, which is basically your soulmate. No matter what happens in life, the string should hold together and you will eventually be with your soulmate. But what probably happened in this animation is that the soulmate was gone, out of this world because the string was cut off and there was blood. This really shook up my emotions."
"Perfect is this fox, and the artist"
i remember this bro!! yt algorithm likes recommending me old videos 😭😭
I LITTERALLY REMEMBER TRYING TO TRACE THIS IN FLIPACLIP IN 2021 💀
La practica hace al maestro 🧐🧐

Wow so adorable❤this is PERFECT! animation! ❤
This animation is awesome but the song nothing wrong with the song by a stand point it’s more of a me problem but I can’t hear the song without crying because it reminds me of dating and that well I would say they were perfect for me and they ended up being a predator and I Really did love them
"im going to incinerate your video now in an edit due to cringe, but still, your animation skill is really high and admirable."
It&#39;s 2024 now but i still somehow enjoy this
The fact that it looks like my fox theriotype is kinda scary and cute

"This is a gorgeous animation. I just have a slight suspicion, that the animator didn&#39;t know, who Jesse and Walt are. =D"
STOPPPP @Stareevee VIBES
I remember watching this 3 years ago.
man this is so cute 😭
That fox looks just like my furrsuit
There should be more credit for the blinking animation. The way the eyes refocus for a split second after blinking is so realistic!
This is amazing
Really fluant animation

This is so well done
The youtube algorithm just recommended this to me.  That audible :D was hilarious in between the verses xD
This is cute I love it

This is probably the first animation meme i ever watched. Amazing.
STOP WATCHING THIS BROTHER<br>WE MUST FIGHT THE MPLA-Jonas Savimbi
Now this is definetly better than those animator who would do 50$ for tweening animation!!! (Ironically i do tweenings too. But i dont sell them for dollars)
Do you still take commissions?
If this is a fox then this is the best video ever posted on YouTube in the entire world you’re so cute and you should get infinite subscribers for this
Perfeito
What do u animate on
ITS SO CUTEEE I saw one rockruff version y&#39;all should see it :3
I love these so much I do have a suggestion tho could u do one with a pit bull:)

3 years later still one of my favorite animations
God I adore this &lt;3
Love it so much!
"So smooooooth! I love this, I love foxes, and I don&#39;t see stuff like this often, it makes my day!"

Would it be okay I I would make Maskes based of the Charakters?
This reminds me of Todd when he met the female fox (I forgot her name) in the fox and the hound
I WISH I COULD DRAW LIKE THIS I WOULD NAME THIS FOX DEXTER!!!!!!
I love this ❤❤❤
Tbh the one with the white fur would be my attitude if someone would be annoying me
"3 seconds in, and I&#39;m screaming: SO CUUUUUUTTE!!"
P E R F E C T ! A N I M A T I O N ! L O V E  U R  A R T  S T Y L E !!! A A A A A A A A
HELP I KEEP GETTING RECOMMENDED THIS CRINGE AH TYPE SHIT
This is still one of my favorite animations you&#39;ve ever made. :D
"I feel like a copy cat rn a lil bit bc my OC or persona OC whatever it’s called is a fox and has a red bandanna, they don’t really look the same by much but still-"
Great job! :D this Animation is really smooth. U have skills. 😊
"I remember sending this to my now ex being like, “this is me talking to u in the morning!” At like midnight.. The person sent hearts back yet ended up cheating on me sooooooooooo"
Can someone find the lyrics for this?
"<b>this.. . . (warning, do NOT click if ur a kid...)</b> 🤮🤢 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2605ym5yp5Y"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2605ym5yp5Y</a>"
who else checks on this channel every few months just to make sure he is alive.
whos here after he got skinny?
I got scammed by the nikocado avocado glowup video
I don’t think he let her in on the plan😭
You are a real motivation to avoid junk food
Bruh she running out of breath while sitting 😭😭💀💀💀
"This channel is the great inspiration for me to workout as often as i can and eat healthy, thanks"
We got skinny nick avocado before gta6
Hearing her struggle to catch her breath from mixing is genuinely depressing.
Who else just genuinely wants to see him turn his life around and be healthy and happy
These are the only two Mukbangers who don’t make me hungry
<b>two steps ahead….</b>
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ocpS7flaI&amp;t=955"">15:55</a> she&#39;s out of breath just by mixing that shit💀💀💀 lord have mercy"
"Nick, you are my motivation to work out, thank you 😊"
Props to that sofa
Whos here after his 2 steps ahead <br>👇
That TikTok was a LIE. 💀💀💀💀
i thought he was losing weight 😢
So everybody is here ?
I hope she also follows on his steps
oh the tik tok was a lie ..
Did anyone else come from the one tiktok to see if it was telling the truth or not😬
Why does this feel like it belongs on the dark web…. Such blatant self harm disguised in the most taboo innocent way but at the root it’s dark and sinister
This is blowing my mind
Who came after 😂 watching his bulk edit 😂😂😂
Who comes here after seeing the fitness edit videos of him😂
I THOUGHT HE WAS LOSING WEIGHT???
who watched this after the villian arc video
The fact she outa breath just mixing the noodles is scary
Anyone else come from tiktok to see if he actually lost weight😭
If only the TikTok was real… 😔
The fact bro managed to.fool all of us
Who is here from TikTok who actually taught that Nikocado is now losing weight?
This is pretty fucking sad… You’re literally watching someone commit suicide on the instalment plan.
Why they saying he lost weight bro
Like this comment if you just watched 2 steps ahead.
Why they lie about him losing weight…?
This is just prolonged suicide 😢
How many people came because of that bulk and cut short vid
"No but this is actually fucking crazy, the whole internet has been reset"
"I was feeling down, lazy and didn&#39;t want to go on my run tonight.....but after seeing this?? I&#39;m gonna run my ass off. Scary scary stuff."
How in the fuck is she still alive
I thought this guy was losing weight.
Aint no way this whole thing was a social experiment.
Use me as a WTF button
I came here from TikTok to see if they were lieing they were…
Bro i thought you lost weight
Poor girl. She&#39;s two steps behind
Wth i thought that these glow up short vids about Nikocado Avocado were real 😭
"I come here to watch his videos every once in a while , when ever i lost motivated to workout . He&#39;s actually inspired me to not become like him . Very good motivation video 💪💯"
Heres my dumbass to check if the &quot;weight loss video&quot; was real 😂
Ok now I’m waiting for her glow up.
"I had a friend that was obese. Somewhere in the middle of these two.<br>My friend at one point gave up on losing weight and started to accept her body like it was. She was even a model for a&quot;all bodys are beautiful &quot; campain.<br>And then with 31 she just died in her sleep. Because of her weight.<br>She had so many plans for her life. She wanted to live. She knew her weight wasnt  healthy, but she never expected it to kill her at this age.<br>What I am trying to say... As long as you want to live, never give up on yourself!❤"
Omg her heavy breathing while she mixes noodles😭😭😭
"My uncle just died yesterday from an intestinal tumor at the age of 67, he always conduced a healty life, always ate good we are italians, and seeing people like in this video show me how cruel life is"
This is beyond mental comprehension. What is real. What is reality.
People checking if he&#39;s still alive<br>👇
I thought bro was losing weight<br>Edit: 15 likes already????
I come here every month just to see this guy if hes alive or not
I bet shes mad about his transformation😂
she was heavy breathing even for mixing the sauce... we are watching 2 people killing themselves... also who the hell gave them 21.000 likes?
Keep on losing the weight and don’t give up! We’re rooting for you nick!
Why TikTok saying you lost weight 😭😭
Anyone else notice how he kept putting random clips of him skinny in there? I think it was a hint at what he was about to drop yesterday. I cant believe he lost 200+ lbs!!! I guess lets see where this goes
This helps me stay on my diet and workout. Thanks Niko ❤
This makes me physically sick.
Who here came from the nikocado avocado glowup vid?
"Waiting to she her transformation next, wonder how she feels right now lol"
"She is breathing hard, just from stirring the noodles 😮"
Shame on all of you encouraging this guy to fasten his death
this is genuinely sad
Whos watching aftrr the crazy reveal 😧
Who else is checking his channel to see his weight loss journey but can’t find nothin 🤣
Me who came here who thought that he already went to the gym and lost weight
"Pov: ur checking either to see if hes alive, or if he really lost weight"
Bro was 2 steps ahead.

Dawg I thought you were losing weight. Not gaining it 💀
So we’re just all here?

Are we going to see this girl losing weight? Then she will say - I am three steps ahead.😂😂
i wonder how she feels today.
BRO İS TWO STEPS AHEEEADD WHAT THE FUUUUUUUCK

Everytime when I’m on a diet I watch him so I can see the consequences of eating (please say that I’m not the only one)
So everyone is here huh
Why would you post this while she’s trying to change her life right now? What a great friend you are
<b>goes to channel</b><br>Still alive? Okay<br><b>clicks off</b>
Bruhhh she’s getting tired just stirring the noodles up 🤦‍♀️
Honestly Nick start a weight loss journey we would all support you and watch your videos.
bro did not lose no weight 🙏💀
Girls transformation is also coming soon 👀
I thought this Mf was meant to be losing weight
So proud if him lost 250 pounds!!!
i honestly feel so bad for these people. it’s disgusting seeing them not even try to lose weight but motivate each other to gain more. and them getting out of breath just by mixing in noodles and standing up for more than a couple seconds just makes me sick.
Who come after transfarmation😂
I thought he lost weight😢
Cant imagine he lost more than 200+ lbs💀
When will she lose weight
Her moaning and deep breathing is worst on an airpod 😢
She are two steps ahead too?
“ALWAYS TWO STEPS AHEAD”
whose here from the vid he posted of losing weight<br>👇🏻
Listen her grunting just mixing up the noodles??? Lmao...good lord
when he dies his soul would try to go to heaven but ultimately he will be pulled down by his weight
"She’s getting exhausted by mixing the noodles, while nick has always been two steps ahead…"
Who else is wondering if the chick is also losing weight
i found the shredded ver of him... and i thought that was real 😢
I checked to see if he was still losing the weight
He looks thin next to her 🤣
I&#39;ll be bamboozled if she got skinny too
All these comments have aged terribly 💀
the best plot twist
You need to turn your channel from mukbangs to a weight loss and health journey. I’m sure you could inspire lots of people to become healthier with this platform
Whos here after the weight loss video? 👇
He was always two steps ahead of us…
So we are all here 😭
"Tbh, I thought Dawg was losing weight 💀 hope he doesn&#39;t die."
Nikocado Avocado I thought you were losing weight 😥
"Wut, wtf I came here because I wanted to see the transformation lmao"
Use me as a WTF button<br><br>👇
I just check on him to see if he&#39;s Alive💀
Who else thinks this is tragic?
Who checks his channel everyday or every week too make sure hes alive<br>                                                           👇
Does she lose weight too???
Tought bro was having a transformation💀
Tik tok said this man was skinny now idk why in tf I believed it .
Wonder if she lost weight
What if he’s not 2 but 4 steps ahead and he’s not Skinny but a whole body builder
Use me as &quot;WTH&quot; button
"Nick , i dont know you but i want you to know that people care about you , we just you to be happy :) self care is hard and as an ex drug addict myself i fully understand why you are doing this which is just to feel better. Just know if you want to , and when you are ready a lot of people will be happy to see you more healthy and happy ! Take care nick and dont let the world get you down. You are loved. ❤️"
This is absolutely disgusting 🤢 and the fact that YouTube allows this is irresponsible and wrong
Bro this is insane
The size of her arms never ceases to amaze me.  The sheer weight of them must be exhausting.
Who else  came here to see if it was really him in that Gym edit where he lost Hella weight
What  happened to that parrot. You ate it.
So We are all here?
Who&#39;s in shock right now?
Who hurt these two?? I want names!!! This is tragic.
Here after he surprised the whole internet 🙌🏻
I wonder if the girl lost weight like he did too
I thought he was on a weight loss journey.......just sad
Two steps ahead…
I feel like the haters care more about his health than his followers
This chanel should be ilegal
i only watch him to see if he loses weight
it&#39;s actually amazing how she&#39;s still alive
I am disappointed I thought he was genuinely losing weight and trying to turn his life around😔
I came here from the 2 steps ahead video
i thought he lost a bunch of weight?
I really hope she&#39;s two steps ahead too 💀
People nowadays don&#39;t even watch his video for mukbangs but just to see if he&#39;s alive
"This is so sad... the worst part is, you can see how pretty she would be if you stripped away all the fat..."
Listen to the noises she makes just from mixing the ramen! She’s having trouble breathing. Smh
"Honestly, props to this guy for at least being realistic. All these tiny youtubers sit down with these mass amounts of food and never gain weight. This is the reality of it. If this is how you&#39;re eating, your body will show it."
I need to know the brand of that couch… some good quality-got more strength then a bridge.
“lifes short” <br>so you make it fucking shorter?
2 steps ahead
ALWAYS TWO steps ahead
How gross is this kind of content.
POV: u come from the new video to see how he was before

"Nic, I hate to see you doing this to yourself… Please stop with the mukbangs and get some professional help before it is too late. We will support you. ❤"
2 steps ahead <br>Im always 2 steps ahead
"When the Avocado is the skinniest person in the room, you have a <b>serious</b> problem"
Who else comes to check his channel once in a while to see if he’s changed but is disappointed he didnt

Brooo I thought he was losing weight how sad
"he still keeps eating , i thought he quit and start diet 🥲 i got scammed"
Though he was loosing weight
"I hope your transformation can encourage the women sitting next to you, who is currently knocking on deaths door 🙏"
I thought he was losing weight
Bro is two steps ahead…..
"Don’t worry y’all, it’s just water weight. We don’t understand nutrition like he does"
The fact shes out of breath FROM MIXING THE NOODLES is hilarious
Two steps ahead...
BIGGEST plot twist irl
Two steps ahead
"Nikocado, ignore all the hate and fatphobic comments, you are bigger than all of this."
that couch is on life support
How many fresh comments
She cant even stir the noodles without heavy breathing…. I rather be starved than be a trainwrack like this
I now understand why gluttony is one of the 7 deadly sins.
did the girl lose the weight too or nah
bro is 2 steps ahead🗿
this being a “social experiment” is crazy.
So all of this was a social experiment bro
Being out of breath from mixing noodles is wild
How the hell!! are you out of breath from stirring noodles????
You’ve gotta stop this man there’s still a chance to turn this stuff around we’re here for you 😊
"Oh my gosh, she can hardly stand up and walk. This whole thing is so sad."
Wait- how is she out of breath by picking up some ramen noodles? 😭
She looks like she cant even walk
This man is 2 steps ahead shes 6 years behind
America….
"I want to thank you Nik, I really do. I’m 27, and have spent the last two years of my life suffering from health anxiety. Mainly worrying about my heart. Doctor’s said I was nowhere near unhealthy enough to be worried about my heart. It wasn’t until I came across your channel that I have really started to genuinely believe it. Seeing the lengths that you have been pushing your body to its limit for the last 5 years, I have been able to overcome my heart anxiety. In short, I’ve stopped worrying, because you are what someone close to a heart attack actually looks like."
Waiting for hers now!
Bro ain’t no way he lost all that weight in 7 months with no extra skin.
What an embarrassment to society
Nick. Please. Stop.
“It was all just a bad dream”
the crazy 2 steps ahead vid
SKINNY NIKOCADO AVACADO BEFORE GTA 6
bro really identified as skinny
He&#39;s Always Two $Ť£₽$ A̶͈̽͋̈́͆̎́͆̔͗͂̚͝H̷̨̲̖̔̈̉͌̓̈́Ē̴͓͕̣͙̝͍̰̟̳̈́͂͒̽̀̍͜͠ͅͅA̶̡̪̹͈͓̠͇̫͐͑̐̕͠ͅD̵͍̠̪̠̝͈̱̩͎̟̀̅̋!
This is honestly just sad. At this point I watch him to make me feel better about myself 😂😂
"I went from 340 to 178 (currently 181 and trying to gain a little weight cause I&#39;m almost underweight =.=) and seeing this yt&#39;er was definitely one of my motivators. There&#39;s nothing positive about gluttony, and I truly appreciate you showing me that, and occasionally being my motivation when I&#39;m having an emotional eating response to something. You can get healthy, but I don&#39;t believe that you really WANT to be healthy. Sitting next to an enabler who has no control herself is like throwing a match on an already burning fire. I hope you find your self worth some day."
The greatest social experience ever who ever new
Me watching all these new comments appear after a whole year 😂
Imagine not having a life and letting yourself go that badly.
If this really was all a social experiment.  It seems cruel inviting people with food addiction to eat with you if youve never had an issue loosing the weight
These are the only two muckbangers  in the entire world that don’t make me hungry
Two steps ahead.
this is sad as shit

Always two steps ahead.<br>of everyone..
The only reason I’m not fat is because I’m to lazy to actually make food
I pray they get help this is so sad
28 minutes in 🤭🤭
How is she gon fit in the casket not tryna be mean but how ?
2 steps ahead…
What the fuck? Why are they measuring themselves
And why does  she keep on saying when mmmmm mmmmm  she was mixing the noodles?
"Please go on a journey of health and fitness, it&#39;s okay to eat a lot and go to the gym regularly, you can still make the videos just turn it all into muscle. Health is wealth"
Always two steps ahead…
Wait the progress was getting fatter? Did I jumped to another reality?!
let me ask you guys. Is SHE two steps away or no step to go away?
I check on this channel to see if he is still living. That is not a healthy way to live man thats hard on the heart and lungs when you are overweight aka obese it can potentially cause cardiovascular problems and feel like you lungs are being sat on by a elephant due to all the excess weight that is causing breathing problems
"I know 10 fat ppl in my life , they’re 9 of them"
Two steps ahead
"why is she moaning… <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ocpS7flaI&amp;t=846"">14:06</a>"
It’s crazy to see this now that he’s lost 250lbs.
Who&#39;s just going to his all videos after his transformation? It&#39;s absolutely crazy and he&#39;s a legend.
2 steps ahead
why does the parrot look so unhealthy :(
Proud of you bruh❤love from INDIA🇮🇳
you don’t know what health tastes like
HE WAS HINTING AT IT.
I cant think rn
تثيرون الشفقة
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ocpS7flaI&amp;t=848"">14:08</a> or your hands are heavy??!"
“I am always… 2 steps ahead”
2 STEP AHEAD
&quot;We were all just dreaming.&quot;
Did you also ear ur Bird?
He&#39;s probably the reason why world hunger started 💀💀💀
Wait a minute… Is that Gorlock the  Destroyer?
It’s insane how huge they both got !!!
✨Two Steps Ahead🥰
"Nick I don’t know you and you won’t see this, but please the man you were you still are. Please please please consider a change in your diet. This broke my sole for an hour."
Two steps ahead
And he is still yet 2 steps ahead
"5 years ago: use his vid as weight loss motivation<br>2024: use his vid as weight loss motivation<br><br>bro cooked<br><br><br><br><br>(this is a yt experiment cuz ion wanna study for my test tomorrow, interesting yt phenomenon, every single fucking comment section on ever vid in this channel has turned into recent comments, hm-  so i wanna find out if i can get even one comment of mine above 10 likes, cuz i never have lol and think this is a shit ton more interesting than studying fucking quantum physics for my test tomorrow, so- fuck it, IF THIS isnt the best time in yt history to break ur record on most liked comments, idk fucking WHAT is lmao)"
"This isn&#39;t life, bro, I&#39;m glad he&#39;s okay, but she&#39;s going to die soon, her heart can&#39;t work with all that body mass, it must already be completely hypertrophied"
Bro was always two steps ahead.…
bro how do they eat this much at once like in a day I eat an apple water a Celsius and dinner
Where did the bird go? It’s probably in one of his muck bangs. As the food though.
"That woman’s belly is hanging on her knees, soon to be around the ankles"
Is that girl still alive?
Jesus this channel is sad. Can&#39;t believe YT allows this
Nah lady getting a work lifting the ramen 😂
"With this video you can educate you kids, do that and you will end like them!"
"Nick lost weight, that thing died"
no cuz why are these comments to recent
When he started YouTube he was so skinny
I&#39;ve always come to this channel to see him but I&#39;ve never expect this
The couch is holding on for dear life
"Reject modernity, embrace tradition. Gluttony will only lead to a life of sadness and death. I will pray for the both of you."
"Two steps a head , more like two years a head 😂🤯 super villain shit 💪🏻💪🏻"
no offense but how are they not dead this is unhealthy
I&#39;m surprised that he still ok
it would be so funny to se them near to each other NOW
He reminds me of that one guy on instagram that gained a lot of weight on purpose to prove how easy it is it lose it especially with discipline. If you actually listen to nick even when he was big like in his apartment he gave lots of advice on nutrition. I would really like to hear nick talk about his journey. Also the way y’all switched up on him just because he lost weight is sad. Proud of you nick! ❤
Imagine being out of breath from mixing your ramen noodles
2 steps ahead lil bro or big bro
This is vile...Yall need some help .. intervention... something <br>Unhealthy
Gluttony one of the 7 deadly sins
اولا قاعد تدمر في صحتك ثانيا مخلي اختك زيك ثالثه المشاهدات اثرت عليك نفسيا وعقليا
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ocpS7flaI&amp;t=240"">4:00</a> they start<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ocpS7flaI&amp;t=388"">6:28</a> he makes the food<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ocpS7flaI&amp;t=1112"">18:32</a> eating"
Did I just spend 10 mins watching them stirring noodles to exhaustion like it’s the toughest thing they’ve done…
Nikko is two steps ahead🗿
"Her grunting and breathing when she is alone mixing those noodles pisses me off, and idk why."
He is always.. Two steps ahead.
STOP ITS LIKE 2AM STOP MAKEING ME HUNGERY👹👹👹
Im honestly surprised that they are drinking water and eating cucumber
"Bro, looks like Constance from monster House 💀💀💀💀💀"
YouTube is disgusting for monetizing and popularising content like this.
What   the  f..............................😮😮😮😮😮😮😢😢😢😢😂😂😂
That truly is so sad..They looked so healthy and happy before. Addiction to food can be worse than addiction to drugs..
"From <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ocpS7flaI&amp;t=1116"">18:36</a> listen with your eyes closed it sounds so wrong 😭"
Both of are cereal killers
El internet no está preparado para lo que hizo ni yo le tenía fe☠️
he will die soon if he will stay like this ... i think
everyone commenting so recently after it was posted 1 year ago
It is so hard to listen to her for like 5 minutes sterring the noodles and breathing so heavy. So disturbing.
"How do you eat all this? I can’t even finish a fast food meal. I really can’t even finish a burger, I share half with my sister. How do they do this 🤦🏼‍♀️"
Remember. He&#39;s always. Two steps ahead
woah….

Bro found somebody a lil more weight than gorlock 😂

Two steps ahead
Nah he changed everythin bro got skinny
You&#39;re supposed to be standing up when you measure your waist and you&#39;re actually supposed to measure the smallest part of your ways cuz that&#39;s actually your waist. Where it dips in at.
I gained weight watching this
She’s probably dead
Its just water weight was real and nobody believed him!!!
Watching this now after his two steps ahead video just feels right lol
Im checking their channel to wait for that liberating vid called : finally starting weightloss
I bet it smells like dead fish in that room
Thanos was right
This is heartbreaking. This is what binge eating disorder looks like. It should not be promoted and celebrated like this. Just wrong

Needle avocado I know you want to so if you get too fat you die so I don’t think you should do that you should work out sometimes and I know I’m a kid but I’m just giving you some advice so what time my friend got super big and they she died. Yeah so you have to work out it’s good for you and God doesn’t want your decoration to die but like you die some point but you’re young still you’re still young you don’t deserve it I know you just wanna keep eating and eating since it’s so delicious I haven’t ate spicy noodles I really want to but I can’t.

Do you still like kids?
"You&#39;re worse than Dr. Disrespect, bro. Drop it."
"Your son, think about your son."
You should lose custody of your child.
I hope your kid never hears about the drama
Now he’s being called out for liking CP drawings. Disgusting.
Kris i hear you like them young<br><br>Edit: thanks for the likes 🤑
Thank fuck he lost his son.
PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM KIDS AND MY LITTLE BROTHER PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Trans women aren&#39;t women
Meanwhile him liking loli posts<br>Edit:yep you&#39;re cooked especially with those new allegations about talking with a kid when you were on college
"You had everything money, a wife, a kid, friends, fame, fans<br><br>But you decided to be a pdf😢"
Stay away from my kids
Please dont even be near a kid
Left his wife and son to play dress up
"chris is a predator, he will never be a real woman"
Bro changed it to “fan page” like we wouldn’t notice 😭🙏

🎵They not like us 🗣️🗣️🗣️ they not like us 🦅🦅🔥🔥🎵
Your a freak Chris
Tucker&#39;s dad is dead.
If you ever feel useless remember this guys divorced his wife and left his son for a minor 💀
"HEY, TEACHER!<br><br>LEAVE THOSE KIDS ALONE!"
You need Jesus ✝️✝️✝️✝️
"Ok seriously, who are the people subscribing to this channel?"
Your son is most definitely going to be bullied when he gets into school due to recent events
Dear Tucker...<br>I&#39;m sorry that that man is your father let me be honest.
"You are cooked bro. Stay away from MrBeast too, you will make things worse for him."
"SAY CHRIS, I HEAR YOU LIKE EM YOUNG"
You had a wife and kid but you threw that away for this shit?
&quot;Daddy? Daddy where are you I miss you daddy&quot;<br>- Tucker Stephen Tyson (2024)
"KRIS KRIS, GO AWAY, COME AND RIZZ KIDS ANOTHER DAY"
Pdf stay away go touch me another day
you literally fantasize about kids
You shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near children. You should be in jail
Finally people started to care. Kris: You are out. Jimmy&#39;s next.
feel bad for your son. he deserves a better father figure
"Certified Lover boy, Certified pdf file"
The child deserves a father that actually loves him loved by millions hated by billions now.
Abandoning his kid and wife? aw hell naw..I bet no one would date him if he ever want ones. What a such disgusting behavior to abandoned his whole family..
Tuckers soon to be villain arc when he grows up to call you out
this is genuinly sad😭😭
"the thing that makes me sad is that everyday i used to come home from a horrible day at school just to turn on mr beast and watch kris. i fucking hate how everything had to change. kris, you used to be my hero, now i look at you with disgust."
You did worlds biggest mistake🥺🥺
"say, kris, i heard you’re about to be locked up."
tryna strike a chord and its prolly a MINORRRRR
"Chris, you break my heart, you was great friend of Community and MrBeast! But now...its just memories, we didnt forgot this. We didnt."
Stop playing pretend
Kris “I like them younger” Tyson
Everyone wants the old kris back
Why isn’t he in jail yet it’s not even funny anymore
This man is crazy
"Now that i think about it, his relationship with his wive comes to an end is for the better. The kid deserve proper father."
Predator Tyson 😂😂
“i like kids” - chris tyson 2017
Of course he likes kids
It’s disgusting that u left your wife and child and abandoned your responsibilities as a husband and father to live in your little fairytale
Back off I&#39;m 15
"Honestly , I feel extremely bad for your son . Imagine finding out that your father likes cp drawing and plays dress up."
We owe an apology to SunnyV2...
What an actual weirdo.
"Say Chris, I hear you like ‘em young"
Kris u made the right decision to be away from your family. Never get close to kidssss
"Your kid deserves a father (dont go back tho, someone else pls)"
God made you who you are why would you change that
I think old chris would mock his modern self
We miss the old Chris!
"I just can not fathom how hard it is to not like kids, at this point it’s a miracle if there is a celeb or influencer who is normal"
Gay
"Say Kris, i hear you like em young, yet you can even take care of yo own f&#39;ing son. These bars get more fire as the drama gets higher, never as high tho as yo good karma back when you wass was straight."
"All I&#39;ll say is, as someone who knew Chris since he was 14. He really enjoyed futa. I&#39;m sure this is where his influence began."
"i think people should be aloud to do what they want to do with there life, but leaving your wife and son is disgraceful"
"&quot;Say kris,i hear you like em&#39; young,&quot;"
Womp womp
you are ruining your life and your sons

My complaint to kris <br><br><b>stop touching kids</b>
"I thought Kris was ok at first, but after hearing the news and thinking about how he doesn&#39;t care about his wife and kid, my thougts have changed, such a bad man/woman/animal whatever."

Where is Chris Hansen when you need him...
This channel should be deleted ….
Do you realise you have a family to raise?
Your compliments to kids
Bro got nerfed 🤢💀
"Kris, why... You were my bias on the squad... You were probably the manliest when it comes to survival challenges. Im disappointed and just sad that it turned out this way. You even left your wife and son for such a selfish reason. Please bro. Stop this madness, as long as your alive, you have a chance."

"I don’t give a crap about someone being who they are, what makes me mad is people not realizing that anyone (almost) can be themselves."
Bro had everything
This comment section is the perfect example of ignorance and hate for the wrong reasons and why someone like Mrbeast will always succeed and continue succeeding
"jus stay away from kids, throw away your computer, you&#39;re sick you need help !"
i really miss the old chris ): i wish he came back
This is honestly so sad. Downfall of America right here
Mustard on that beat yo
Chris acts like female : just I&#39;m sad I don&#39;t want to...<br>Chris transgender: I SWEAR GOD
Channel deleted in 3……2……
you like em kiddos huh
Chris please don&#39;t. I can&#39;t bear the pain by looking at Mack in your place. All of this is not worth it. If you are facing any issues talk to someone.
Time to be a statistic
I’ve never seen a bigger glowdown than what happened to Chris. I don’t think you get why many people are mad about your transition. You use to be the fun loving southern athletic goofball of the group that many fans grew up with. And now you left your family and your whole personality. And now your this whole different person who just makes gay jokes .I never got why you married someone and had a kid when this whole time you wanted to transition.
What a great father
time traveller: moves a chair<br>chris:
Bro is dr. Disrespect but actually disrespect the law
BRO WHO IS THAT THAT AINT CHRIS BRO💀

Your ex wife should be allowed full custody of that kid.
"Why are you guys forcing your personal feelings on their children? Her wife supports her, and children are children who do not understand the complexities of the human mind. Y’all are all grown-ups, so should understand each other&#39;s feelings.<br><br>And it seems like they have no problems with each other. It&#39;s just you guys who are causing more problems for her family and friends.😅"
MINOOOOOOOR

I hope your son is unaware of this and he&#39;s safe with his mom and I hope his mother tells you to get out of their face everytime you try and visit them.
The dad lore is not gonna be a good one when tucker hears about this in like 6 years
Save that voice for court💀
"In Japanese popular culture, lolicon (ロリコン, rorikon) is a genre of fictional media which focuses on young (or young-looking) girl characters, particularly in a sexually suggestive or erotic manner. The term, a portmanteau of the English-language phrase &quot;Lolita complex&quot;, also refers to desire and affection for such characters (ロリ, &quot;loli&quot;), and their fans. Associated mainly with stylized imagery in manga, anime, and video games, lolicon in otaku culture is generally understood as distinct from desires for realistic depictions of young girls, or real young girls as such,[1][2][3] and is associated with moe, or affection for fictional characters, often bishōjo (cute girl) characters in manga or anime.<br><br>A manga-style depiction of young girls wearing lingerie. Lolicon artwork often blends childlike characteristics with erotic undertones.<br>The phrase &quot;Lolita complex&quot;, derived from the novel Lolita, entered use in Japan in the 1970s. During the &quot;lolicon boom&quot; in erotic manga of the early 1980s, the term was adopted in the nascent otaku culture to denote attraction to early bishōjo characters, and later only to younger-looking depictions as bishōjo designs became more varied. The artwork of the lolicon boom, which was strongly influenced by the styles of shōjo manga, marked a shift from realism, and the advent of &quot;cute eroticism&quot; (kawaii ero), an aesthetic which is now common in manga and anime broadly. The lolicon boom faded by the mid-1980s, and the genre has since made up a minority of erotic manga.<br>Since the 1990s, lolicon has been a keyword in manga debates in Japan and globally. Child pornography laws in some countries apply to depictions of fictional child characters, while those in other countries, including Japan, do not.[4] Opponents and supporters have debated if the genre contributes to child sexual abuse. Culture and media scholars generally identify lolicon with a broader separation between fiction and reality within otaku sexuality."

Doing the voice isn’t the only thing that’s hard
Great dad.
"If you were doing something inappropriate to children/minors, you should not be allowed near your child.  If you weren&#39;t doing those things, then you need to try really hard and prove that you didn&#39;t.  The evidence says you did, so it is up to you to prove the evidence doesn&#39;t mean that or is false."
"He prob tryna strike a chord. A Minor, perhaps?"

&quot;What&#39;s Ohio?&quot;<br>Bro&#39;s never been taught US states 💀💀💀
"Remember fellas, These people literally had to hire a whole camera crew, budget and purchase the props, and also get actors and a director for this."
"There should be an extra one cause of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=6"">0:06</a>. She says chat"
Walmart needs to declare bankruptcy
“Maximum aura points” yea we’re cooked
we got brainrot on commercials now 💀😭😭
The most unrealistic part of this was the bus driver being nice to the kids
We never getting flying cars with this stuff
"Because of this ad, I’m shoplifting every time I go to Walmart."
This makes YouTube Rewind 2018 look like cinema.
Bro when I was their age I thought eating a four leafed clover would give me superpowers 😭🙏💀
Saw this commercial. Now I shop at target.
At least they didn&#39;t say &quot;SIGMA SKIBIDI TOILET KAI CENAT FANUM TAX GYATT RIZZ&quot; because if they did we&#39;re cooked.
I find it impossible that marketing executives have met actual human beings
"I do like the concept of a bus driver getting advice from a student, like it seems pretty simple and pretty wholesome, but my god…"
i lost braincells
“Sigma or Ohio?”<br>“Sigma”<br><br>GOT ME HARD 😭
this one commercial set society back no less than 25 years
"I better see a corporate apology video, ukulele and everything"
This is literally the grubhub ad and chips ahoy situation again
What an unfortunate day to have literary and auditory skills.
"As a Gen Z’er who hears all this, I can say we both absolutely do not speak like that, and on certain occasions we’re even worse, mostly sarcastically <br><br>Edit: yes I know this is Gen Alpha but don’t you get it wrong, we say some of these words too. Especially Rizz, Sigma, and Aura"
Why do adults think we say these words literally every second? We literally use them as jokes
She honestly Skibidi with that acting
She looks like jojo siwa from wish 😭😭
“Hip with the kids” ahh video 😭🙏
And Walmart goes bankrupt🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
What bus driver is that attractive?
My brain still can’t comprehend this is a real ad
Can&#39;t wait for the next commercials<br>&quot;I gyatt to rizz up that alpha!&quot;<br>&quot;Skibidi sigma ohio!&quot;
"&quot;what&#39;s up, fellow kids?&quot; Except we&#39;re just combining the slang of Gen Z and Gen Alpha"
I saw this shit in a fucking movie theater 😭😭😭<br><br><br><br><br><br>Edit: omg mom I&#39;m not famous
"I am fine with regular brainrot because mlg was a thing, but this commercial is like if Nickelodeon tried to make an mlg compilation"
&quot;Greetings fellow children&quot;
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=3"">0:03</a> Bro thanks she&#39;s the next jojo seaweed ☠️"
What’s so much worse is all the adults who probably laughed at this commercial
"The most unrealistic part of the ad is honestly the fact that someone that attractive and fashionable is a school bus driver. What bus driver would put that much effort into their appearance when the associated stress of the job puts you 10 years closer to the grave? If she was a teacher, I&#39;d get it, but a bus driver seriously? Also, no bus driver would ever step off the bus to walk a kid towards the school"
"Wrong, the cringe counter is 10"
<b>Reminder that this goes on for FIVE. MINUTES. in the full ad.</b>
Who woke up one morning and thought to direct this. Who sat down an entire council of people discussing how good of an idea this is. AND WHO APPROVED
Me before watching this: I’m having a good day with no intentions of self harm<br><br>Me after watching this: I want to play Russian roulette with myself and all 6 bullets
When ironic humor is taken as unironic vocabulary ☠️
"The fact that the kid looked DIRECTLY at the camera at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=39"">0:39</a> is killing me 😭😭"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=11"">0:11</a>  I couldn&#39;t fully comprehend what word was said."
She doesn’t even finish “You ate” she just says “You æ”
I feel like I’ve entered Hell now.
This is why aliens won’t visit us
The pistol looking mighty fine right know
Y&#39;all this ain&#39;t the whole ad 💀<br>The ad&#39;s 4 minutes 💀
"“Guys we need something to relate to the kids so teens will spend their money in our store!” <br>“Just spam random slang words you find on the internet into the script, that should work.”"
I haven’t seen this one on tv yet and I hope I never have to endure it again!
the people who made this commercial are the same people would pronounce meme as &quot;meh-meh&quot;
Saying &quot;the 1900&#39;s&quot; like it&#39;s before electricity existed made my bones hurt.
I saw one of these ads. Mfing 40 year old woman said rizzy rizz 😭😭
How movies thought the 21st century would be: Flying cars and super advanced technology!<br>The 21st century IRL: B R A I N R O T
You know if a A.I apocalypse happens. Im joining A.I
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=32"">0:32</a> the only thing that could’ve made this worse is if she said “ay dap me up”"
9 billion neurons are rotting inside my brain as of watching this
"why is this a walmart ad?? nothing to do with whats in the friggin shop, just &quot;omg no cap your fit slays&quot;??? atleast that one ad with the black guy and the balloon had SOMETHING to do with the product (the end)"
as an australian that dosent have a single walmart commercial i am glad that i didnt have to watch this until now
Ain’t no way full-grown woman said “what’s Ohio.” She said it like she hasn’t even heard of the state.
"Dear Walmart:<br><br>Unmake this. <br><br>Sincerely, everyone"
"This isn’t even brain rot, this is just new slang terms from a new generation."
these superpowers gettin nutrealized i can only watch in silence..
I love the corporatocracy!!!  I love the lizard people who make all my commercials!!!  Yes please give me more!!!  YEss!!! YEAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAA
Influencer moms must be lapping this up.
"This is like that part in that inside out short where Riley’s mom tries to talk to her about her boyfriend but with, “cool” slang."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=32"">0:32</a>  that shit sent shockwaves through my brain (I’m a headphone user on weed)"
This is a Grant Wisler video that became a reality
the “aura points” got me gang I’m so done none of us talk like this 😭
"saw deadpool &amp; wolverine in theaters, the commercial for amazon prime said &quot;get the most rizzy rizzy clothes for back to school for your little freeloaders&quot;"
Got jumpscared by the euphoria instrumental at the end
its not as bad as that one amazon ad that felt straight out of family guy
fire the marketing team
This made me steel from my local Walmart🤑🤑🤑
This is the exact reason why I am considering to get YouTube premium.
"I hate back to school ads with a passion, but this one... Spirits begone from this house"
They are trying so hard to fit in with kids😭😭
I swear the marketing team did this on purpose so people would share it and talk about it. Genius if you ask me
"If I suddenly saw this commercial while I was drunk, I would cry laughing from how terminally stupid it is"
"I had to watch this ad before a GOOD movie. Lord have mercy on all of our brains. Also, THE EXTENDED VERSION. IT WAS LIKE 5 MINUTES LONG!!! The worst, most horrible, most cringey line was in chalk on the ground: “All Rizz no cap”. I have lost faith in humanity."
I have never seen a bus driver so happy wtf what&#39;s going on 💀
Walmart really pulling the HOW DO YOU DO FELLOW KIDZ vibe with this one.
i feel like this took 10 years of my lifespan
The 1900s line definitely deserved a mark on the counter too
We got a brainrot Walmart commercial before GTA 6💀
"It&#39;s 9 points because she said &quot;no cap&quot;, &quot;cringe&quot;, and &quot;Ohio&quot; and the adult questioned what &quot;Ohio&quot; was."
We ain’t gonna shop at Walmart ever again with this one 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
School bus: +1<br>People happy in the bus: +1<br>Teenage music in bus: +1<br>Bell: +1
I think a wimpy 6 on the cringe counter is FAR FAR too generous. I&#39;m gonna need to sleep this one off as if I have the flu
lol a corporation roasting an entire state too 🤣🤣😭
“How do you do fellow kids?”
Maybe we were a little too harsh towards Youtube Rewind 2018...
Oscar worthy acting
This commercial turn my suicidal thoughts into plans.
LMAO both gen alpha and gen z say things like “sigma skibidi rizz” completely ironically but theyve completely fooled millennials+older
"The school bus in the video is a 1990 IC 3000, it lived to see the days when the saying &quot;nerd&quot; and &quot;dork&quot; and &quot;give me your lunch money&quot; was more popular than &quot;cringe&quot; and &quot;ohio&quot; and &quot;skibidi toilet rizzler fanumtax in ohio&quot;"
THEM SUPERPOWERS GETTING NEUTRALIZED I CAN ONLY WATCH IN SILENCE🔥🔥🔥
The bus driver is an influencer… of course she’s in it.
that poor Blue Bird 37000 bus having to be the main location where this all has to happen 😭
"Remember, it’s not the child’s fault if they get dumber, it’s the parents’."
Thank god Target doesn’t go for shit like this 😅😅😅😅
The fire alarm sound was justified
bro walmart was desperate
"Your counter has 6? Mine has 100, what the skibidi"
next one they&#39;re gonna be like &quot;get the new skibidi slicers at walmart&quot;
Bro this ad played in class and me and my friends we were laughing and wheezing on the floor this video made my day🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is exactly how middle school girls act 😭
Best target ad I’ve ever seen
Did I just have a stroke
"Me after watching this ad:<br>“Hey Joker, do you need help making a pencil disappear?”"
I hate how this generation is going to replace us
I can&#39;t tell if this is better or worse than the grubhub ads
They forgot the skibidi sigma rizz
“Whats Ohio? 😃”
I actually couldn’t believe that this was real when I first saw it. No way this isn’t an SNL parody in disguise.
I say these things so much I don&#39;t even know if its un-ironic anymore 💀
"Walmart -100,000 aura??? 😭 I&#39;ve genuinely never heard anyone use &quot;Aura&quot; irl"
i got lock jaw watching this
WALMART NEEDS TO CLOSE DOWN.
I must cleanse my mind with “brother may I have some oats”
I love the “oh” when the driver resides that she said “1900s”
Flying cars they said.
"“How do you do, fellow children!”<br>Ahh ad 😭"
"If I ever go to the US, I will make sure to never buy anything in a Walmart in my life."
“This is what the kids find cool nowadays” <br>                                -the people at Walmart
"If this was directed like a self-aware, tongue in cheek satire it would have actually been a killer ad. I have a 12 year old daughter and this ad nails the zoomer brain rot she picks up at school perfectly."
&quot;What&#39;s Ohio&quot; she clearly failed Geography class
"content of the video aside, there is no bus driver that looks or dresses like that on the job"
This was too generous
"I bet the conversation was for this ad was<br>“People! We need a ad that the Kids will be trendy with! Something Trendy! Something the kids will like”<br>“I’ve got one!”<br>“Good! The kids will surely like this!”<br><br>But seriously who’s idea was it to include slang words that kids don’t use seriously, it’s like they hired a so called “Slangologist” so they could get the children to like the ad"
Nah that first girls outfit did not eat 😭💀
My honest reaction<br><br><br><br><br><br>KILLME KILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKIOOMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLEMEKILLMEAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAYA
"Even as a 2000s kid, “1900s” feels wrong"
Tesco: Every Little Helps!<br><br>Walmart: Maximum Aura points.
“What’s Ohio”<br>Me: A state from U.S.A
I can just imagine the co-workers going:<br>“Well how do we get more popular?”<br>“..Hmm.. what do the kids like?”<br>“ <b>✨B R A I N R O T✨</b> ”
Is this is an ACTUAL commercial?
I was expecting the Ohio one to make the counter shoot up to 10^14.
Welcome back 2020-2021
Walmart single-handedly killing slang and getting everyone to speak like Sephiroth.
Euphoria at the end 😅😅
"As a kid in the 90&#39;s, i was thinking we would have like selftie shoes from back to the future..."
Them superpowers bein neutralized i can only watch in scilence
Let’s be honest. Smartest marketing move ever. They knew how much internet attention this was gonna get
"Imagine having a stage parent who forced you to audition for this attocity, and you dont get the part. There&#39;s not enough therapy in the world"
Why did euphoria start playing😭😭😭😭
"“Kaylen, that fit slays”<br>Will be stuck in my head now😭💀"
This hurts
"Literally the least realistic school bus driver ever, lol. Thin, relatively young, conventionally attractive, dressed up, not tired—whoever was in charge of this was clearly a career carpool kid."
We got Brainrot Walmart ads before GTA 6.
"As an 11 year old gen alpha, Walmart needs to be stopped."
"Only 6 on the counter? You must be feeling generous, I counted more than a dozen"
My frontal lobe is struggling to work after watching this ad
I’m gen alpha and this makes me wanna go shrivel up in a corner and cry
i was forced to watch a 5 minute version of this advertisement at the movies. man has built hell on earth
Someone one get a damn award for the actors that did this crap 💀🙏
"Ad agency: &quot;our ad is about a school bus driver&quot;<br>Casting, make-up &amp; costume: &quot;ok, here&#39;s a rich soccer mum&quot;"
them superpowers getting neutralized I can only watch in silence
“ Everyone’s really feeling themselves “ weird but she’s saying everyone’s in a good mood
"Have we not learned from the Chips Ahoy ads? It&#39;s a genius marketing strategy to make an ad so stupid, people can&#39;t help but share it online"
I&#39;m suddenly tempted to shoplift things I don&#39;t need.
"As an older member of the Gen Z community, I would sincerely like to apologize on behalf of what the younger half of the group is saying/doing."
"We have nikocado loosing weight, mr beast getting canceled, and brainrot walmart ads. What a time to be alive"
When she says ‘that will be our lesson on the ride home’ she looks directly at the camera for like half a second 😂
"As an entree level Walmart worker, I&#39;d just like to apologize on behalf of the entire company for this."
&quot;maximum aura points&quot; more like i lost aura just watching this 😭😭
"Hippity hoppity, walmart no longer has me there Shoppity"
&quot;HOW DO YOU DO FELLOW KIDS&quot;
George Washington did not fight  for this shit to be made 💀💀
I’m scared that when my internet gets better all of sudden I’ll hear “BE A SIGMA AND SHOP AT WALMART”
I’m still in disbelief that this wasn’t a skit.
Ain&#39;t no way we got brainrot commercials before GTA 6
Walmart needs to get their shit together cause no one talks like that 😭😭
The fact they&#39;ve played this before the last 3 movies I saw (the full 5 min version too)
This is definitely a bit tongue in cheek.
I thought I was watching an ad I didn&#39;t know this was an actual video😭
I think my Brain has stopped Working after Watching this
"Chat, idk what you’re talking about.<br>This really makes me want to shop at Walmart!<br>I usually just shoplift but now I’ll consider paying!"
"It&#39;s giving &quot;how do you do, fellow kids?&quot;"
The most cringe part is it&#39;s 8 year olds talking like this and no 8 year olds talk like that.
Them superpowers gettin neutralized
This should be classified as a war crime.
if bro played the whole ad the cringe counter would break 💀
Every godamn damn second of that ad deserved to bring the counter up
I expected them to say &quot;skibidi&quot; or &quot;erm what the sigma&quot; 😭🙏
Rule number 1: <b>NEVER</b> use slang in commercials.
Imagine engaging with children as superiors.<br><br>Imagine being a corporation.
bro why did euphoria start playin at the end end no way they got my goat in brainrot 😭😭
"Brought to you by the Kamala Harris campaign heads. This is what you guys want, right? <br><br>Vote blue!!"
"Walmart is making it worse for themselves. First, they make one of the worst stores ever to exist (because I&#39;m forced to go there with my mom every other day, and now they&#39;re making garbage ads??? I&#39;m not very surprised, to say the least."
In my minds eye I can see the boardroom busy coming up with this idea for a commercial
If she was a real bus driver she&#39;d warning that girl to not make her tap the sign again
"ok, this is def going for the &quot;all publicity is good publicity&quot; approach, they were trying to get people sharing it while saying it&#39;s cringe. a commercial is supposed to say something to make one interested in whatever is being sold, but there&#39;s legit nothing in it that would make any sane person go to Walmart, there&#39;s just no substance. it&#39;s like saying you want to drink water while pointing at a frying pan<br><br>so all in all, I&#39;d say they succeeded, joke&#39;s on us"
It&#39;s cringe that the bus driver looks that good and put together and happy about her job.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=29"">0:29</a><br>&quot;everyone really is killing themselves&quot; honestly, THIS was the last reason."
This is the reason why the world stock market is gonna crash
"I honestly thought this was AI when I watched it. I didn’t think Walmart could make such a horrible commercial, but I have sadly been proven wrong."
"I hope Walmart knows that after seeing this ad, I&#39;ll be far too embarrassed to even step foot in their sores now."
They were probably pointed at gunpoint to say all this stuff in the commercial.<br><br>This just makes my brain hurt dude (even as Gen Z)
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=29"">0:29</a> &quot;everyone&#39;s really killing themselves&quot; me after I saw this ad"
I can feel my brain cells making toast in the bathtub <br>                         - Steven He
we got commercials trying to be hip with the kids irl before gta 6 💀
That kid with the bow hair be looking like JoJo Siwa 2.0
"To begin with, that woman is too hot and bubbly to be a school bus driver."
I wish my bus driver looked like that! 😂
Whoever allows their child to wear bows like that on their head need to be reported to CPS
i have been rewatching this video so much i can recite every line<br>like how it was in the 19 hundreds 💅
We went from the mean girls commercial to this? 🤦🏾‍♀️
If this video was any longer I would’ve painted my wall with my brains💀💀💀
Sam Walton didn&#39;t die for this.
i got a walmart ad when i clicked on this
this ad makes the chips ahoy ads look great
&quot;How Do You Do Fellow Kids?&quot; <br>- Steve Buscemi
When I&#39;m in an overexaggeration challenge and my opponent is this comment section: 😨
They did a version that just went on for what felt like an eternity (I&#39;m pretty sure it was at least 5 minutes) and I felt like ripping my skin off when they played it at the theatre before the actual previews started. Never getting to a movie early again T-T
"It&#39;s giving, hello fellow kids vibes"
It&#39;s like they did this on purpose just to lose our braincells
"WHATS UP, MY FELLOW KIDDOS?<br>Ah vibe"
the back to school ads are wild fr
<b>WE GETTING OUR BRAINS EATEN WITH THIS ONE</b> 🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥
Those super powers getting neutralize
And we all thought their 2019 Black Friday ad was cringe
Walmart trying to be “hip with the kids” 😭🙏
Dude I saw this ad in the theater. 😭😭😭
How did &quot;1900s&quot; not get a point? That drives tons of people born in the &#39;90s or earlier (myself included) nuts.
Euphoria at the end healed me
The only issue with this is that the counter is way too low
"Ever meet anyone who likes Wal-Mart? Yeah, me neither. Thank god for H-E-B."
the pain it hurts they don&#39;t even use brainrot properly
you forgot the &quot;we are so back&quot; on the board in the first shot
Nah they slayed the ironicism. Not cringe if you own it. They ate.
Wanted: flying cars<br>Got: Walmart being stupid
"We should like, actually make it illegal for any corporate executive, no matter the age, to try to use slang in commercials like this. I can already barely tolerate seeing &quot;Hits different&quot; and &quot;(x) is a vibe&quot; in bargain bins across the country, but like... Can we sanction a company like we do countries?"
I appreciate them not counting the &quot;back in the 1900s&quot; joke because that one isn&#39;t cringey so much as mean. And kids absolutely say that with total sincerity.
That bus driver has a gyatt
The most unrealistic part of this was the hot bus driver.
I swear bro i normally just stare at the actress the whole time but i couldn’t this time 😭🙏
&quot;maximum aura points&quot; GIRL YOUR A GROWN WOMAN
Seeing this make me want to go  to Walmart to buy a toaster and proceed  to drop it in a bathtub.
im gonna start shoplifting from walmart now
Watching this american commercial as a non-american is so weird to us
Walmart should provide 10 free trips to everyone for making this blight on humanity
And the sad part is that they probably spent a ton of money creating and advertising this
The maximum aura points made me shit my pants
This feels like it&#39;s catered to people who can&#39;t even get a job yet.
"This is just CRINGE misappropriation of AAVE and just misuse of gen z slang. Walmart, you’re paying for my therapy."
I feel like I got tear gassed
Bro euphoria starting at the end killed me for sum reason
That woman is NOT making minimum wage driving a bus so I don&#39;t need the cringe counter for this because it already broke.
This makes my skeleton itchy
"As a Gen Z who feels as thoigh was born in the wrong time, I say this is how it feels everyday hearing pwople in class or the hallways."
Sam Walton did not die for this 😭
"I feel like the military pulled up and started blasting M4s, MP5s, RPGs, at point blank range right next to my ear while a rooster crowed and  gangam style&#39;d to old mcdongal had a farm.<br><br>Moral of the story: don&#39;t put gen-z slang in your ad. Or it might sound like this."
I&#39;m sueing Walmart.
When we getting them hover boards with this stuff? Rip humanity
Them superpowers get neutralized
Walmart executives just sent Society back 19 years we aint never getting holographic technology at this rate 😭
Now I am glad that walmart failed to become profitable in my country (which is germany btw if you were wondering)
What a horrible day to be sentient
This is why Aliens won&#39;t visit us<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The Brainrot will kill them
"It’s funny how marketing not too long ago made us want to be cool, like the kids in the commercials, but now the new cool kids make us unsettled, like we would rather be ANYTHING ELSE other than what modern “cool” is supposed to be."
first time this ad popped up i shouted &quot;YOU INSIGNIFICANT FUCK!&quot;. when i realized this was real and not a dream
"Lyrics:<br>&quot;Taylen that fit slays&quot;<br>&quot;Cap, can i tell you a secret? We dont say slay, We say You ate&quot;<br>&quot;You ate, cool what else you got<br><b>Whispers</b> &quot;Maximum aura&quot;<br>&quot;Maximum aura points, Poppin the preppy vibes, Wait is preppy cool again?&quot; &quot;But its different, from how it was in the 1900s&quot; &quot;Oh oh, So everyone is really feeling themselves&quot; &quot;No cap, You aren&#39;t cringe or ohio&quot; &quot;Whats ohio&quot;<br>&quot;That will be are lesson on the way home&quot; <br>Tell me if I made any mistakes"
Can these big corporate companies just stop with trying to be cool with the kids just to make a quick book because it is absolutely cringe💀
This video have extracted IQ from my brain
Grant wisler predicted this and we just laughed 😔
Jokes aside the girl&#39;s acting is pretty good.
When ads try to be &quot;hip with the kids&quot;
I saw this commercial on TikTok and was like wtf
Someone in there mid 30s who’s trying to fit in with the new gen made this script
6? That’s a very low number for the amount of times I wanted to break my phone while watching this
Even Gail Lewis would be disappointed
I feel like I lost all of my aura. And my sanity.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=34"">0:34</a> this hurt my ears so funkin&#39; bad"
"I’m gen Alpha and I never Heard anyone my ate or younger saying ,,preppy” ,,maximum aura points”  or ,,No cap”."
Walmart is about to get that lucrative 12-and-under demographic.
&quot;Everyone&#39;s really killing themselves!&quot; - Walmart 2024
Were not going to walmart with this one🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
The only good thing about this ad is that they didn&#39;t use a &quot;skibidi&quot;
"Everyone is talking about how cringe this is, but ive seen a lot of kids speak exactly like this thinking it wasnt cringe"
The Ad was so bad that the dialog wasn’t even recorded on-set. It looked like those actors were lip-syncing. I wouldn&#39;t want any of thst nonsense coming out of my mouth on camera either
"the fact that my parents like Walmart when I was little, and I think they still do- 😭😭😭"
I have officially lost my faith in humanity.
Not the euphoria intro at the end 😭
"despite our differences, all the generations can come together and agree that this sucks"
THEM SUPERPOWERS GETTING NEUTRALIZED
This makes not want to go to Walmart anymore
They didn’t say “I’m the alpha sigma skibidi ohio.” 😢
This makes me want to steal from a Walmart
At least there was no:<br>Skibidi<br>Sigma<br>Rizz
Went to school in the 90s; ‘preppy’ has never been cool
How did I see this shit in a movie theater💀
A state thats 221 years old and it took some scooter kids calling it goofy to destroy any legacy that Ohio has left
Walmart thinking they caught up with the year 2024
"If You Think This Is What, WYD If During A Walmart Commercial They Say: “Skibidi Gyatt Rizzler”"
Them super powers been neutralized
Bro we got brainrot on live television before Gta 6 thats crazy 💀
Am I the only one who thinks this is hilarious??😂
"You were too lenient, I counted like 20"
no cringe counter for when she called the ‘90s the “1900s”?
"That is not a bus driver, I have never seen a bus driver under 57."
Thank god my country’s ads are peak
Its pretty bad that the animated Kroger commercials aren&#39;t as bad as this.
I&#39;m telling a trusted adult how this commercial makes me uncomfy 😭🙏
Yeah no wonder people always steal from Walmart
&quot;STOP! FUCKING STOP--&quot; -DigitalInfinity
"Character AI ah conversation 💀💀💀 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=7"">0:07</a>"
Thank God i was born in Lebanon
I like it when they said: “it’s ohio time”
This really explains a lot about the West nowadays
Euphoria playing at the end is wild.
"No, you missed the goofy bows and the teacher saying &quot;everyone&#39;s really feeling themselves&quot;<br>I counted 8."
This is gonna be my 13th reason
The ending is so brain rotted and funny 😂
"&quot;I&#39;ve lost all ambition<br>For worldly acclaim&quot;"
My local Walmart changed their name to skibidimart
My interest in learning english and it&#39;s consequences have been a disaster for my mental health
We got Walmart brainrot ads before Gta 6
i&#39;d rather wish that mac and cheese parody advert was real
At least they didn’t say “Gyatt” or “Rizz”
At least they didn’t say skibidi toilet or sigma
We got a brainrot walmart commercial before gta 6 💀😭
"my last 2 braincells are fried, thanks walmart. now im never robbing them again"
"There was more, watch the whole ad. The counter would exceed limits"
This doesn’t contain Sigma Meal: Skibidi Slicers. Cringe Counter: Infinite
We got brainrot Walmart before gta 6 💀
There is no bus driver that is this pretty lol
"Honestly, as a younger person who uses and hears people say all this stuff (or something close to it) multiple times a day, this add isn’t even bad. I don’t really see why everyone is so upset and crying over all the “brain rot”, because they didn’t even say skibbidi, gyat, rizz, or anything. It’s just stuff that kids say sometimes that’s been exaggerated for commercial advertising. In my opinion, it just comes off as a funny and cute story about the younger gen sharing their creativity to others"
"Ngl, that’s max aura points when she’s an alpha"
I don’t want to live on this planet anymore
when the kid grows up this will be her biggest shame
Ayo was that Euphoria at the end 💀
&quot;commercial tryong to be hip with the kids&quot;
This commercial makes me cry
"Let the TV &amp; State Schooling tell them who they are, then they’ll tell their parents."
This makes story of undertale look like the fucking mona lisa
Brain rot<br>Brain rot<br>Brain rot <br>Brain rot<br>Brain<br>ROT<br>BRAIN ROT
I missed the old commercials
“Wow everyone’s really killing themselves 💀” I thought they said killing 😭
I dont want to live on this planet anymore
wtf is you ate ive never heard a single other kid say that
"Literally clicked on this video and skipped 10 seconds ahead, Woops"
"When tf did Walmart made an ad? I mean, I know I don&#39;t live in a place with one but seriously?"
"Bruh I counter 4,275.628957139087 amount of cringe points, I think there’s a few more than. 6"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=23"">0:23</a> <br>“But it’s different from how it was in the 1900s” 💅💅💅💅🙄🙄🙄"
This reminds me of the stupid chips ahoy ads a few years ago 🤣
Please put me out of my misery
I fucking hated this commercial. It was brain dissolving. I was in tears to watch the 2024 twister movie in this freaking came on and I was gonna scream.
I fucking hated this commercial. It was brain dissolving. I was in tears to watch the 2024 twister movie in this freaking came on and I was gonna scream.
I’m surprised they didn’t use “sigma”
The Eurphoria intro 💀
"You are, in fact, wrong. <br>You missed a zero after the six"
When I try to watch the Beetlejuice movie this came up 😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏
"hey, let’s get this video to more views than Walmart! 😂"
You forgot to add the goofy dance scene at the end… the cringe counter would be at 100 if you added it omg-
I don’t even know if this is real or AI. That AI toys r us commercial changed my perception of commercials for life.
My brain shut down at “Ohio” 💀
"Actually, +1 in the beginning when we saw those annoyingly big bows on that little kid"
imagine a kid saw this ad on tv
Walmart has just given me a trauma
walmart really &quot;ate&quot; shit with this one
Bro I got stage 5 brain cancer while watching this.
Plot twist this is a ploy so the geb Z would stop using that language
The back to school ads are crazy
this commercial feels like a parody
This lady doesnt even know her states... SHAME!!!!!!!!!!!
The world needs more ads like the among us chips ahoy ones
"strangely, i sort of love this commercial.  it looks intentionally cringe and very meta, which is very unique compared to the plethora of unintentionally cringe commercials on tv."
"This ain’t real, you can’t convince me it’s real"
i can feel the radiation kicking in
This made bile rise up in my throat.
You know you&#39;re getting old when you&#39;re a gen z cringing at gen alpha&#39;s dumbass sayings.
THEY CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
Bro they pulled a chips ahoy 💀
BRO THE SIGN SAYS WE ARE SO BACK MORE LIKE WE ARE NOT BACK WITH THIS ADVERTISEMENT
and i thought chips ahoy ads were bad
My bus driver was born and raised in the US and could not articulate english.
This ad is overwhelmingly caucasian
"&quot;how you doing, fellow kids?&quot;"
Teleportation machines they said
"As a gen alpha, I dont even know kids these days talk like that"
&quot;maximum aura points&quot; 💀💀
Adds are meant to make more people want to buy your product/s but after seeing this add I never want to go to Walmart ever again
Bro I really wish we could go bad to the 1900s
I think you missed quite a few
They gotta strop trying to be &quot;hip with the kids&quot; because it rots my brain more than the actual brainrot
Incorrect. The bus driver is 100% of the time older than 50 based on my experience
You forgot the girl mewing in that one shot in the classroom🥲🥲
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=35"">0:35</a> WTF WHYD YOU BUST MY EARDRUMS<br><br>and why does euphoria start playing at the end 💀"
I&#39;m pretty sure gen alpha isn&#39;t old enough to go to Walmart
Gen z when new generation 😡😡😡
Walmart cooked when nobody was hungry 🔥🔥💀💀🗿🗿🤡🤡
I got a Walmart ad before this lol
I bet they were held at gunpoint while making this 😭😭😭😭
Counter is 6. So that means 60% cringe.
Never going to school again 💀
I hate when companies try to use genz slang just to attract them when the only thing theyre attracted to are cheap rotteserie chicken
“feeling themselves” ???? 😭
And this is why Target is better
every 7 sec there&#39;s at least one brainrot word
"I hope this is why they&#39;re lowering their prices; otherwise, no one would show up after this."
This is very important im glad I spent my time watching this
"Why is there bus driver young and hot, and mine is old and mean 😭"
I was watching that in the movie theater and me and my sister were just side eying each other the whole ad
Do they have anybody under the age of 50 producing these commercials? 😂
"Yep, never buying things from Walmart ever again, this bs is probably a human rights violation"
WATCH THE FULL AD ITS THREE MINUTES AND HAS MUCH MORE BRAINROT
this ad gave me a pneumothorax ☠️
if you look closely it says &quot;bogle elementary&quot;
PLEASE HELP MY SANITY
You were being lenient.
First Dunkin’ Donuts now  Walmart ☠️🙏
I saw this in a movie theater and it was 4 MINUTES LONG
"It&#39;s only cringe because a corporation did it, but y&#39;all Gen A&#39;s do this 24-7 LMAO"
Bro made ads for the brainrotted 8 year olds 😭
Just wait till she learns about gooning
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=31"">0:31</a> the laugh 😭"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=39"">0:39</a> what’s Ohio? She probably didn’t pay attention in geography"
man gen alpha cant have childhoods they&#39;re constantly being bashed on by older people for being weird. this is an example.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=11"">0:11</a> I thought she said “you wiggie”😭"
I just came from the loop one😭
Those parents need to tattoo some common sense into their brain
See y’all in therapy during 2025
walmart REALLY wanted their customers back- (KEEP BOYCOTTING)!
It&#39;s brain arsenic at this point
This has zero reason to exist
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=1"">0:01</a> anyone notice the sign saying we are so back"
Vehicles in this video: 1998 blue bird International 3000 series school bus (vehicle used a lot by a main character)
is it just me or do i hear euphoria at the end??????
Bro the end made me scream.
walmart you may have lost a loyal shopper. yall have hit an all time low lmfao
"I hate to say this with my whole heart… but this is what my little siblings and their friends sound like to me. Heard one of them say ‘I’m cooked’ the other day while playing a video game and someone else said ‘glazed’ in a way that meant ‘over-complimenting’. I’m officially detached from the new culture, I guess. 🤷🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️"
"The only thing that made me laugh in this commercial, is that six freaking ding on the cringe counter lol"
Walmart too afraid to add the rest.
And this is why I shop at target more...
Grant Wisler try to warn us 💀
This ain’t Walmart bro💀
You had to include the girl mewing
Some of those things they say I only say it in social media and sometimes thats ironically
To the boomers that cooked this commercial up: GET OUT AND NEVER COOK AGAIN
"This isn’t even the whole ad, there’s a longer version of it…"
Am i the only one who sorta likes this add .-.
I feel like this got exponentially more cringe as it went on.
"Any other brits out there, Asda is run by the same people as Walmart. I&#39;m never shopping at Asda again."
Defund Walmart!
😭😭 what the hell was this <br><br>😭😭😭 This hurt my head
The last one would be count as 2 points
Why is the bus driver like her mom?? 💀💀
Remember when everyone found those chips ahoy ads cringe?
They trying to be cool so hard 😭🙏
"This commercial is trying so hard to be hip with the kids, it almost hurts. And it does the opposite of what it was trying to do, now I want to avoid Walmart like the plague."
This better have been worth the money
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=26"">0:26</a> nobody says 1900’s if they’re talking about 10’s-90’s🙏😭"
It got so cringe they had to censor it
1900’s is wild💀
Finally Walmart became sigma.
This is the 9/11 of ads
who tf in the board room approved of this and what was their goal? 😭
Of course they had to include the offensive “Ohio” slang term.
This genuinely made my stomach hurt and my throat feel strange. Shouldn&#39;t have watched this after eating.
This commercial Killed my dog and  sold me to North Korea.
I’m more surprised skibidi or sigma wasn’t mentioned
I feel like i got dumber watching this somehow
"Well this commercial worked at least, given how many people are cringe hating it."
"we don’t say slay, we say 🇦🇪"
I stole from Walmart while blasting this at full volume
There is no way that this is real.
bro i git got a walmart ad before this no joke
Welcome to Skibiti Elementary <br>Today&#39;s class is Rizzonomics 101.
Am I the only person who recognized the music from Kendrick Lamar’s euphoria in the end?
I can&#39;t f*cking believe they said ohio with full seriousness
Some of those worth double
Not cringe...<br><br><br><br><br><br>ITS SLAY PREPPY❤❤💅😍✨✨
walmart isn&#39;t GOING back to normal
"It’s so odd that she says “what’s Ohio,” like, I get not knowing the meaning but do you not know Ohio exists? Lol"
Thank you for adding that sound really loud ringing slide whistle towards the end. Now I won&#39;t hear anymore cringe ever
"What happened to the zany over the top ads from the 90s... <br><br>How we have failed to create, to influence, to inspire...<br><br>I feel to old not just for this generation but for the world this age have transformed into...<br>😢"
Ain’t no way this is real 😭😭😭
it looks like someone who went on tiktok comments to make this commercial
"i feel myself losing braincells, why walmart i hate you now😭<br>btw why is euphoria playing at the end"
i cannot believe they made this omg
&quot;Maximum aura points&quot;
"We’re getting older and are repeating that our newer generation slang is getting worse, just like our older generation told us about their slang, and continues with the older older generation, then the older older older generation, etc."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=1"">0:01</a> The board says &quot;we are so back&quot;"
There is no way this is a real fucking ad. It&#39;s like grubhub all over again
I saw this and now I shop at Costco.
"It should have been 100,000,000,000,000,000,000."
This counter dosent ring enough
Tf you mean &quot;what is Ohio&quot; you know what Ohio is 😭😭😭
This is why I steal from walmart and shop at target
"wrong, the cringe counter is actually infinity"
Not enough sins. MOAR SINS!!
They really hired Kamala Harris to play the bus driver
What was the little euphoria jumpscare at the end there
WE ARE GOING BACK TO THAT PHASE OF YOUTUBE
Guess the ad works if this is even a video.
i don’t wanna go to walmart anymore
As if I didn&#39;t already hate Walmart enough...
WHY IS THE BEGINNING OF EUPHORIA PLAYING AT THE END
I think I’d rather have the fish tanks then this ☠️
BRO I TYRING TO WATCH DESPICABLE ME 4 AND THEN THIS STUPOD AD POPS UO IN THE THEATER😭
"Cringe counter: 43 for every second of this ad. No, add 1 for Walmart, so 44"
The noose is calling me
were losing brainsells with this one!
See Walmart stocks go up about 14 percent each year. But with this? Id say sell all your investments from Walmart
"glad I&#39;m not a native English speaker, therefore not having that shitty ad lol"
Poor victorian children died watching this video
If it was up to me the counter would be 11
This generation be messed up
wouldve added more points at that little girl saying &quot;ohio&quot;
Now I see why everyone don&#39;t like Walmart
"this is inaccurate, that score should be at least 700"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=31"">0:31</a> Okay Mickey Mouse!! 😍😍😍😍"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=9"">0:09</a> &quot;UAE&quot;"
I wish I could take back the seconds I wasted watching this.
"Why are y&#39;all suprised? YOU guys made the brainrot words. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think this commercial is terrible, but still."
look Walmart. if you&#39;re broke just say it
Sam Walton would be ashamed
I watched this in deep pain
Walmart tries to go the same path as grubhub.
This gave me depression 😂 <br>Im joking walmart
why does it turn into euphoria💀
"I didn’t even have to type in Walmart and it showed up<br>Glad I wasn’t the only semi-sane person left after being forced to watch this<br><br>Actually I lied, I covered my eyes for the most of it but the audio now makes me hear monkeys in the walls"
At least they didn’t say skibidi or rizz
You forgot to add one in the 1900s line
this is not skibidi this is brainrot
"Brace yourselves, iPad babies are coming…"
oh but that was kinda cute
why do they always try to fit in 😭😭😭
This can&#39;t be an actual ad...is it?
No bus driver looks like that c&#39;mon
"The cringe has DoT damage, I still feel the pain"
Unpleasant made the script 💀
EUPHORIA MENTIONED 🔥
&quot;Welp... geuss I&#39;ll die.&quot;
YO THIS IS ACTUALLY REAL?!? walmart has brainrot bro💀💀💀
Is it just me or is this a red flag that the bus driver is “grooming” the students?😳
Some mf studied 4 years of marketing and made this?
I think every frame of this counts as cringe counter. So probably a couple thousand
Ya&#39;ll going bankrupt or something?
<b>Searches up how to not be a gen alpha</b>
"Walmart, the desperate for relevance company."
No. This can’t be real. THIS CAN’T BE REALL!!!!😱😱😱😱
My brain is hurting
Yeah manman started playing euphoria at the end
“What ohi-“ STOP. 🔫
&quot;Everyones really killing themselves&quot;<br><br>WTF?
can we split gen z into two generations i am totally lost
No way this is for real 😭😭😭
My last brain cell 😢
Humanity is cooked as we know it
The bus driver is a YouTuber but i don’t remember her name 😭😭I’m pretty sure she’s the one who pretends to be her hispanic mom
When i saw the meme i thought it was edited...<br>Who&#39;s even the audience of these ads?
somebody stop walmart.
dude last time i heard them say rizzy rizz 🙁🙁
Actual brainrot it hurts
i&#39;m switching to target now
Atleast it wasn’t that bad. But ain’t no way walmart did this.
I refuse to watch this so I’m commenting in hopes that someone else will explain the video to me.
Do the same thing with Amazon back to school commercials. Those commercials are annoying.
"not brainrot enough, no skibidi or Kai cenat"
Ohio started as meme now people using it like it some kind of real meaningful word
Is it just me who finds the  bus driver so hot
“Poppin the preppy vibes” made me shit myself on god 😭🙏🗣️🐴
Gen Alpha be Like:
I&#39;m sure I know I did NOT hear &quot;maximum aura points&quot; and &quot;ohio&quot;... 😳 I MUST be high 😭
This video hurts me physically
"one has to wonder, what does this ad have to do with Walmart anyways?"
it is so damn awkward everytime people try to speak like the think gen z kids do. 💀
I refuse this to believe this is real.
help i got a walmart right b for this lol
Maximum aura points     no cap you ain&#39;t cringe or ohio    😂
this ad is worse than grubhubs ad where they fucking dance while eating
There was way more than 6 😭
"Son, whats a &quot;Fire fit&quot;?"
Aura goes crazy
Trying to be &quot;Hipe with the kids&quot; Is definitely something... It&#39;s not positive but it&#39;s something
Aura debt for generations 😂😂😂😂
As a general rule alpha myself I declare that this is not goated
Where’s the part where they all sing the Skibidi Toilet Song on the way home?
Bro this generation is doomed 😭
nahhh there was WAYYYY more than that
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=31"">0:31</a> PLEASE tell me why she let out a fucking Mickey Mouse “Uh-Huh!” out of her mouth."
"The video is wrong, cause the actual counter: 600"
needs more skibidi
This is why people steal from Walmart
"It’s true though, this is how y’all sound now"
My count seemed higher but some have higher tolerance I suppose.
Glad I&#39;m not American
Euphoria plays at the end?
Brainrot commercial indeed.
I never thought cringe could hurt me both mentally and physically
She say what’s Ohio? That is a state ma’am
Where&#39;s the Death Star when you need it?
"Missed where she says &quot;chat&quot; at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=6"">0:06</a>"
Why it turn into euphoria at the end 💀
I saw this at the movie theater 💀
You forgot the part with the mewing girl
"This slang isn&#39;t getting us no where in life, and thats coming from someone born in 2005(me). That&#39;s why I perfer to use less slang, and try my best to increase my grammer instead of dumbing it down"
Are these terms actually cringe or are we just not used to them?
Hey that’s the woman who marries like twenty men and constantly creates drama from it. Nice pick Walmart! Personally I think Gal would’ve been a better option but it’s not the first time corpos don’t listen to their audience.
What has this world come to
OHIO IS A STATE DID YOU FORGET YOUR STATES MRS JOHNSON
Multiply the cringe points by 500
“What’s Ohio”
"Why Walmart, why couldn’t it be the chips ahoy ads that stay cringe 😢"
"How the Hell do they not know ehat Ohio is, it&#39;s a state in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!"
"euphoria, them superpowers get neutralized we can only watch in silence, the market we once knew is brainrot and now spiralin your movin just like a gen alpha every antic is feeling distasteful"
im stealing next time I go to walmart
this is the same as the “on fleek” commercials i saw a couple of years ago. it’s just unfunny execs wanting to get attention by making people purposefully cringe so it can stir up buzz
thank god I don’t have walmart in my area (I live in ny)
Humanity is failing. This generation is DOOMED.
Walmart got the call
Why can&#39;t I find the ad on the Walmart Youtube Channel?
yeah I think I’m done. this is the final straw for me.
Not her + maximum aura
The cringe counter is actually :11
You should’ve used RDR2 low honor sound
who let the skibidi toilet kids direct a commercial
ads in america:
Gen Alpha? More like Gen Beta
I am losing my high Iq 💀
man target on top
I saw this ad in a theater and it went on WAY too long.
"As a gen z, I hate this."
"Oh goodness no. I don’t know if you watch Grant Whistler, but he made a parody on commercials like this. I was hoping I never encounter commercial like this. If you wanna watch this video, it’s called. commercials trying to be hip with the kids."
"To be far, kids these days actually talk like this."
Um excuse me I think I bought the wrong tv
They used the Ohio meme in 2024<br>Why
"This is just slang, not brainrot."
I think you forgot three zeros
not enough counters
Oh no my fellow millenials made this. God we are uncool.
When y’all make these videos about brain rot you still say them brain rot words as well
Did she ask a child what Ohio is😭
"My girlfriend and I saw this the longest version of it ever in the AMC. Theater, cringe is not even the word. I was looking around the theater at other people  are you f*<b>***</b> kidding me? This is the craziest garbage"
How many more commercials like these are we gonna get before the creators realize no one likes them or finds them funny
"I can only speak for myself, but I cringed a lot more than 6 times."
whoever made this needs to be punished
There were way more than just six
"erm, what the sigma"
I watched an ad before this video :/
We dont say slayz we say
“What’s an Ohio”
I feel like kms rn after seeing this
bro walmart if ur going bankrupt then just tell us this is the most cringe ahhh ad
This is why God hides in heaven
Thank fuck I don&#39;t watch ads.
"How do you do, fellow kids?"
What have I just visually seen
Gen z people as advertisers
glad they didnt say skibidi
Im shopping at Winn Dixie and Aldis now
What r they trying to advertise here 😭😭
"…….im scared, I’m genuinely scared"
900 Sub❤
i feel like crying
Target’s better anyways.
Walmart tweaking 😭
I am no longer shopping at walmart
Phone yeeted <br>YouTube deleted<br>Therapist greeted<br>Braincells needed

Why was the beginning of Euphoria at the end lol
Why&#39;s it cringe if thats what everyone craves?
Cancel walmart
Nuh uh imma take their advertising privileges from them I’m done
I have a headache now

What product did they even advertise? 😂😂
Tf is Kendrick doing at the end
<b>screams and pulls my fucking hair out</b>
Wait this is from Walmart…? 💀💀💀
"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in<br>&quot;advanced&quot; countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread<br>psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in<br>&quot;advanced&quot; countries."
Now you know how it feel Gen Z. lol.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=11"">0:11</a> bro im gen alpha and i dont even know wth that means 💀"
PREPPY VIBES😂😅😅😅

Ohio got me crackin
Ain’t no way they made that shit
This is why targets better
The child is called &quot;Taylen&quot;?
wayy more then 6 buddy
GYATT! Now that&#39;s rizz!
you missed multiple cringe counters
"I don&#39;t understand, is it like her mom is the school bus driver?"
Can you add one for that vocal fry
"Walmart, and the white house fr be like:<br><br>&quot;Hey what&#39;s good young fellas?&quot; And it just shows an old guy with 90s skater clothing on 💀<br><br>They Trina be cool with the kids and the younger generations, it ain&#39;t working, it&#39;s fr cringe 💀"
Bs<br>That bus driver would have quit by the 3rd stop and would’ve had an OF made before lunchtime
Who TF says &quot;that ate&quot; I prefer slay
is that the fucking euphoria intro at the end
Grant wisler was correct
Of course they had to throw the cap in there . Ridiculous word . People just make up words and they sound very ignorant.
LMAOOO WHATT?!?!
this hurts to watch
Dude I&#39;m gen A and I don&#39;t even know any slang
Bruh our generation is cooked
Brain nourishment
i don&#39;t even know what she said.
NO WAY THIS WAS AN AD
This isn&#39;t Kristi Noem.
i’m being tortured
Is that the beginning of euphoria or am I crazy
This generation&#39;s f*cked.
was that euphoria at the end
I called Drake he’s on his way
tf is happening in burgerland 🤦🏿‍♂️
i think this is rage bait. i didnt know walmart was in this need of attention 💀💀💀
why is there a grown adult siting next to a kid?
"<b>Chat, Is This Real?1!</b>"
Tried to sneak euphoria at the end
"It’s makin’ me cringe, Dutch!"
Boomers seeing this: 😭😭
"Six? SIX??? literally every action, outfit, and word that occurred in this was cringe"
a grown woman can ask what ohio is now
Sylvan Ville
Why does our society worship children?
Wheres that meteor...?
End my suffering
This commercial does not slay chat
WATCH THE FULL AD
Why does euphoria start playing at the end
The devil is busy

Chips ahoy ad reference????
Walmart so skibidi
THIS CANNOT BE REAL. WHAT THE FUCK.
Noooooo shot ohio got mentioned
needs more dings
My cringe counter was wayy higher but ok
"I’d give this ad a 7/10, for not having any politics 😊👍"
I think the counter should read 10 instead (if you were to count every time a cringe slang term is used)
This commercial is cringy and it&#39;s very bad telling that thisjs is the wrong season and it&#39;s supposed to be summer
Ain&#39;t no way 💀🙏
Rip walmart
I want to cry
hellish creation
how is this walmart 💀
My personal cringe counter 27
Walmarts in Ohio:

This ad was a waste of money 💰
Even worse than the Amazon ad
Bro their clothes look so dumb.
This was almost unbearable to watch
There were at least 20
"Okay, I’m sorry this is such a cringe commercial, but don’t try to glorify shoplifting, sheesh!"
"This was very unwholesome not Sablin chungus, 0/10 on the Poopenfarten scale, I sentence everyone who was involved in this ad to 10,000 years inside Bormann&#39;s Desk in the Big Building in Neu Berlin <br><br>(THE ROT CONSUMES THE ROT CONSUMES THE ROT CONSUMES THE ROT CONSUMES THE ROT CONSUMES THE ROT CONSUMES THE ROT-)"

I think there was at least one cringe for each second in the video.
Okay that’s it I’m fooking done with this cringe year I’m listening to Denzel Washington when he said turn it off put it down……
Theyre trying to hard to be relevant 😭 they were already kinda relevant tbh tho

😂
How is this ad cringey?
Oh 😮 io
I’m brain kil itsell
its garbage
It wasn&#39;t that bad
I gotta give respect to the trailer for not disabling like or comments.
"Sonic: &quot;Uhhh... meow?&quot;<br><b>HE TRIED TO WARN US, BUT WE DID NOT LISTEN</b>"
Sonic’s “Uh...Meow?” was actually a warning to us for this movie
"Don’t cry because it happened, Smile because it ended."
People: This is a musical or a horror movie? <br><br>Director: <b>Yes</b>
At this point I&#39;m starting to think that making bad character design choices is just a marketing tactic
At least 40% of the comments: We owe Sonic an apology
The book is way better because it doesn&#39;t exist
"If you think watching this trailer on your phone is bad, imagine the people sitting in the theater innocently waiting for the previews and having no idea what they&#39;re about to witness."
Watches cats trailer<br><br><br>Me to sonic trailer: <b>Perhaps we treated you too harshly</b>
Paramount :We can make worst CGI<br>Universal : Hold My Cats
"If this was shown on plane, people would still walk out."
Me: Can you make a blockbuster please?<br><br><br>Universal: uhhhh.. Meow?
Me: Mom can we get a cat?:<br>Mom: We have cats at home<br>The cats at home:
"Sonic: Uhh, Meow?<br>He warned us about this people. He warned us all"
God&#39;s punishing us this whole year because we made this monstrosity last year
Sonic: Uhh...Meow <br>Universal Studio: I got you fam.
<b><i>I think that&#39;s enough live action movies for my lifetime...</i></b>
Either I really just watched this or someone drugged my pasta
I remember seeing this trailer in theaters for the first time. My family and I had a difficult time holding in our laughter.
When you realize Sonic was actually trying to warn us.<br>&quot;Uhh... meow?&quot;
Sonic tried to warn us by saying “ uh... meow?”
Me: No one can ruin cats for me<br><br>Universal Pictures: Is that a challenge??
imagine being someone who was actually hyped for this movie to come out
This is what the people in the birdbox saw before they die.
"When taylor swift said &quot;I&#39;ll be the actress starring in your bad dreams&quot;, she was trying to warn us."
I see somebody drew inspiration from all the positive feedback the Sonic Movie was getting
"Almost four years later and I still can’t believe people actually looked at this and thought “Oh yeah, this will definitely be a hit”."
And here I was about to celebrate my first week of sobriety.
This looks like if they based a whole movie about face swapping yours with your cats
“Lol ew the Sonic movie looks terrible.”<br><br>CATS: <b><i>”Uhhh... m e o w?”</i></b>
Sonic movie: Fixes and improves just about everything wrong with it.<br>Cats movie: We don&#39;t do that here...
when did animation turn into a contest to make the most terrifying creations possible
"<b>THIS WENT THROUGH AN ANIMATION TEAM, A WRITING TEAM, A CHOREOGRAPHIC TEAM, A STORYBOARDING TEAM, THE DIRECTOR HIMSELF AND NONE OF THEM THOUGHT, &quot;YEAH NO THIS MIGHT BE HORRIBLE&quot;?</b>"
&quot;Uh meow&quot; takes a whole different meaning now. Thanks sonic
<b>”hey man should they be cats or humans?”</b><br><br>director: <b>”both”</b>
"Director: ok so I want the characters to be cats<br>Artist/designer: a what?<br>Director: a cat, you’ve seen one before right?<br>Artist/designer: uh....yeah obviously"
If you stare into the void long enough the void stares back
"Congratulations Universal, you have just created the next big meme of 2019. Brace yourself for the storm."
Me: &quot;Thanks for making me not want to kill myself&quot; <br><br> <b>Card declines</b><br><br>Therapist: &quot;Watch this&quot;
Warner Bros:  it chapter 2 will scare so many kids<br><br><br>Universal: hold my milk bowl
Everybody gangsta till this is what we find in Area 51
“Do you want live-action or complete animation?”<br>“Yes”
I don’t see why people hate it. It seems like a good horror movie.
This Cat in the hat 2 trailer looks like something I would see beyond my deepest nightmares.
Forget Area 51 let’s raid universal studios and see what aliens they have there
Annabelle and Pennywise: We will bring much horror to 2019!<br>CATS: Hold my catnip...
So many amazing actors and singers just wasting their talents away.
"Sonic The Hedgehog: “Uh, meow...?”<br><br><br>The Cats: “You called?”"
Me walking into Area 51 looking for cat-girls:<br><b>sees this</b><br>&quot;no&quot;
Patient : I am terrified of humaoid Cats.<br>Therapist: there&#39;s no such thing as humanoid cats.<br><br>Humanoid cats:
Mom: we’re not buying a cat we have cats at home.<br>The cats at home:
"<b>Dear God, it&#39;s like if Steven King tried to make a Dr. Seuss movie</b>"
This looks like the most expensive SNL sketch ever made.
"2009: Wow, Avatar was amazing! I wonder how CGI will look in 10 years?<br><br>2019:"
"My sister cried after seeing this, she even became afraid of cats."
They could legitimately turn this into a horror movie...
"Paramount Pictures: Boy, my sonic movie is so damn<br>creepy <br><br>Universal Pictures: Hold my furry costume"
<b>Universal Pictures</b> : releases CATS trailer<br><b>Everyone</b> : what did you bring to this cursed land
<b>Movie Cuties comes out:</b><br><br>Literally everybody hating on Cats:<br>&quot;perhaps i treated you harshly&quot;
"Therapist: James Corden Cat can&#39;t hurt you, it&#39;s not real.<br>James Corden Cat:"
"So many great actors, such god-awful nightmare fuel of style."
When sonic said “meow?” He was warning us
"Imagine being given $95 million, but you still get outdone by a dancing cat and a blind Turkish man with drum!🤣"
"This movie is gonna spawn a lot of memes, and that I can appreciate"
The actors in this movie: <b>&quot;I&#39;m going to be a star!&quot;</b><br>This movie: <b>I&#39;m going to end this man&#39;s whole career!&quot;</b>
Sonic Movie: uh... meow?<br>Universal: Write that down! Write that down!<br>Edit: Coming back to say the movie was shit.
"&quot;This Christmas, you will believe&quot; That Hell is very much real."
Jennifer: “a new day...has begun”<br>Jason: “jAsON DEruLo”
what the hell is happening i feel like I just snorted 10 pounds of furry cocaine
Paramount: We&#39;ve officially made the freakiest character in history <br><br>Universal: Ummm... Meow?
I saw this trailer half an hour after it came out. Seeing the internet&#39;s reaction in real time was beautiful
Now I can see why Area 51 wanted to keep the anime cat people from the public
“Sonic CGI is so scary”<br><br>Universal: “wanna bet?”
"Sonic: Uh, meow?<br>He tried to warn us, but we all just ridiculed him. Look at where we are now."
Whos here because you saw Jason A video and was curious?
"It&#39;s wonderful that Hollywood has become so tolerant and diverse, now even my sleep paralysis demons can become movie stars!"
Just imagine all of the memes that are going to come from this
This just tells you theatre and film are two entirely different media
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U&amp;t=144"">2:24</a> was the best part"
"On second thought, sonic looks pretty good"
This confirms that we aren’t ready for what’s in Area 51.
Sonic: &quot;I have the ugliest uncanny character design in the entire CGI history!&quot;<br>Cats: &quot;Hold my milk!&quot;
"Chip: “I think we’re in the valley…..The Uncanny Valley.”<br>Dale: “The what?”<br>Chip: “Do you remember that weird animation style in the early 2000s where everything looked real, but nothing looked RIGHT?”<br>Dale: “Oh yeah, that stuff was creepy……”<br>Chip: “Well, I think this is where they ended up.”"
This looks like a Doctor Who episode you’d skip when you rewatch the season
This movie is the visual representation of drinking orange juice after brushing your teeth
IT Chapter 2: I&#39;m going to be the scariest movie of the year!<br><br>Cats: Hold my cat nip
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U&amp;t=140"">2:20</a> &quot;This holiday season<br> you will believe&quot;<br><br><br><br>That it&#39;s all down hill from here"
Sonic the hedgehog: scariest live action movie of 2019<br>Cats movie: hold my milk
"From the director of two critically acclaimed masterpieces, comes the payment for the sins of man."
"&quot;This Christmas, you will believe&quot;<br><br><br>I believe that i will have nightmares"
The fact they managed to get all these big stars to be in this film is such a surprise
This is what the people in Bird Box were seeing...
I’m glad they’re making a movie about the demons I run from after I shut the light off in a room.
"Your director was so preoccupied with whether or not he could, he didn’t stop to think if he should."
Mom can we have garbage<br><br><br>We have garbage at home<br><br><br>Garbage at home:<br><br><br>Edit: 64 likes OMG!!
Wow “It Chapter Two” really changed from the first movie
The Cat in the Hat is the only realistic human looking cat allowed to exist.
"Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn&#39;t stop to think if they should"
I have to applaud Universal for keeping the comments open
kid: mom can we get a pet?<br>mom: there’s cats at the house <br>cats at the house:
Real cats need to make a film called &quot;Humans&quot; in revenge lol
Put that thing back where it came from or so help me
My beloved white cat died 4 years ago... This is wonderful trailer... Thank you &lt;3
Everyone: The sonic design sucks. Nothing can be as bad as the sonic design.<br><br>Universal: Observe
Cats movie trailer: Has nearly 250k dislikes<br><br>YouTube rewind 2018: <b>You&#39;re gonna have to bump those numbers up. Those are rookie numbers.</b>
It looks like one of those wierd dreams that we&#39;ll never remember the next morning
Me: <b>mom can we get some cats?</b><br>Mom: <i>we already have cats at home</i><br>The cats at home:
The characters look like they&#39;re just using a snapchat filter
It 2: The scariest movie of 2019<br><br>Cats: Hold my Meow Mix
Hey how about instead we just make it fully animated since it’s already 90% CG?
Coronavirus: I&#39;m your worst nightmare👹<br>Cats: hold my milk🥛
therapist: the james corden cat isn’t real. it can’t hurt you.<br><br>the james corden cat: 🐈
"putting everyone&#39;s favorite actors in, just makes it more disturbing."
It appears as though 2019 is the year for weird-looking live-action movies.
Truth: You haven&#39;t seen the movie.
“Just because It can be done doesn’t mean it should be done”
"Me: mom, i want a cat girl<br>Mom: we have cat girl at home<br>Cat girl at home:"
IT 2: I&#39;ll be the scariest movie of 2019<br>Cats: Hold my litterbox
They ask &#39;Can we?&#39;<br>But they never ask &#39;Should we?&#39;
IT 2: I&#39;m going to be the scariest movie of the year.<br>CATS:
Every actor is announced:<br>Me: HOW DID YOU GET DRAGGED INTO THIS?!?!?!
it looks like how those weird 17th century painters thought cats looked
"You know, I wouldn’t have minded if they brought back hand-drawn animation for these kind of things"
30s - 50s: let&#39;s make our cartoon characters as appealing as possible<br><br>90s- 2010s: let&#39;s improve our cg technology to make it as believable as possible<br><br>2019: Anthro-Uncanny nightmare fuel.
CATS: it&#39;s out of the bag.<br><br>US: Please put it back in.
This i going to be that movie that everyone looks at you weirdly when you buy tickets to
I never thought they’d take black panther in this direction
Bro imagine walking late at night and seeing these monstrosities dancing 😂
As a cat this is offensive.
Me: do you want to make a normal movie?<br>Universal: no... no I don’t think I will
These comments are why im here
I&#39;m sueing! They have no right to use my sleep paralysis demons without my permission!
Sonic told us.....he said meow.... He warned us about this movie... We didnt listen
We all owe the sonic movie a big big apology
"&quot;It is the worst thing happened to cats since dogs&quot;~~~~<br>&quot;Ricky Gervais&quot;, 21st Century on Earth"

"Poor, poor kids that will be scarred for life by this Lovecraftian hellscape"
This movie dropped right before the pandemic hit. We should have known it was a warning for what was to come.
-911 what’s your emergency<br>-....<br>-Hello?<br>- <b>Cats trailer sounds in the background</b>
"The singing and choreography will be fantastic but the visuals...honey, I&#39;m gon have to listen to this blind"
I feel like “YOU WILL BELIEVE” is a threat... I’m scared.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U&amp;t=48"">0:48</a> I didn&#39;t know know that my sleep paralysis demon was also an actor! Good job Bob!"
The whole trailer looks like those weird medieval cats paintings with human like faces.

“Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could they didn&#39;t stop to think if they should!” - Jeff Goldblum
"Mom: we’re not buying a cat we have cats at home.<br>The cats at home: 👁👄👁"
And here i was thinking that  &quot;IT chapter 2&quot; was gonna be the scariest movie of 2019
And I thought the Sonic Design was terrifying but this.....this is a whole new level man
They actually made this so Sonic would look better
This may have been one of the last films to ever be seen in a movie theater. I’m glad the theaters went out on a high note.
What in the world did I just witness with my own two eyes
"…on second thought, maybe that old Sonic movie design isn&#39;t so bad."
Taylor swift wasn’t lying when she said “I’m the actress starring in your bad dreams”
"I remember the day this came into theatures, my cousin and I were trying to decide whether we should watch this or Jumanji 2, and I took one look at the poster and I got this terrible feeling that we would both be scarred for life if we watched this and tbh I think she had the same feeling"
Universal made a movie about my sleep paralysis demon?
How is it that the trailer for “Cats” is WAY more disturbing than the trailer for “IT: Chapter 2”?
"To all of you real cats out there, humanity owes you an apology. I am so sorry."
"Me, being tortured: <b>*Flinches, expecting to be stretched or something*</b><br>Them: <b>*Puts on Cats*</b><br>Me: <b>*SCREECH... MAKE IT STOP...*</b>"
"coulda made something magnificent with practical effects, makeup, and set design.<br><br><br>instead we get this nightmare fuel."
IT 2: I&#39;m going to be the most terrifying and disturbing movie in 2019.<br>Cats: Hold my milk.
Petition to Copyright Strike Universal for stealing Sonics new redesign
was universal on drugs when they&#39;re making this<br><br><br>no seriously
This makes me feel like I&#39;m receiving forbidden knowledge.
"Now i realize who Sonic was calling to when he said ‘Meow’, another creature equally as hideous"
finally a horror movie that is so scary that the trailer sends chills down my spine
If I literally filmed my self laughing for 10 hours it wouldn&#39;t be that much of a nightmare. U don&#39;t wanna see me laugh
"What we&#39;re expecting from Area 51: Cool alien weapons, Minecraft 2, Team Fortress 3<br>What we&#39;re gonna find:"

Hey guys I think we treated sonic too harshly :/
"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I truly believe this film to be the peak of cinema. When this first released, I watched in theatres with my pet cat Barthalemeow, who is notorious for not liking any films. However, thirty minutes into this masterpiece, my cat and I were in tears, embracing each other over the magnificence of this film. When Idris Elba showed up, I let out an audible gasp, and my groin ached, truly I was witness to something beyond human comprehension. The only thing that could make this even better, would be to release the butthole cut, however I understand that seeing that may be just like seeing the Ark of the Covenant, and could spell the end of humanity. Two years later and I have still not recovered from this life changing experience, my cat is now a Spanish Guru, and teaches the way of the butthole<br>Love, Jamie"
I don’t think this is what people meant when they were asking for genetically engineered catgirls...
Forget about Area 51. We need to storm Hollywood and see who the f*ck has been in charge these last years.
I actually thought this was going to be a horror film. It sure looks like one tbh.
I’m only here for Jennifer Hudson’s vocals 😍😍 She would have ate it in a different film 🤷🏾‍♀️
Oh dear.<br>I can see most of the money was put into paying the actors and not for the effects. <br><br>Also &quot;Random Furry Joke Here.&quot;
Elon Musk never imagined this when he wanted to create catgirls
If this is not a prequel to The Cat in the Hat I&#39;m not watching
"This reminds me of one of those nightmares I had when I was little that I can&#39;t get over with even after months. <br><br><br>Hell, I hate those memories..."
Yo those snapchat filters are getting out of hand
1960: we will have flying cars in the future <br><br>2019:
Focus group: &quot;we liked the part where the fat one is stupid and gets hurt&quot;<br>Studio head: &quot;that&#39;s going in the trailer for sure&quot;
And about a month after the movie came out we got COVID. Pretty sure we deserved it...

"If Jason Derulo doesn’t sing “jAsOn DeRulO” at least once during this movie, it’s canceled."
First couple seconds: What can go wrong? Yes Cats is a weird play but its-<br><br>Sees CGI Cat: no...
"Forget the trailer for Stephen King´s &quot;It 2&quot; ,this is the most scary shit,I´ve seen all year!<br>Hell,even Pennywise propably said himself: &quot;Nope,I´m going back to my sewer and won´t come back for another 27 years.&quot;"
"Wow none of the actors, production staff, director anyone thought this is scary? <br>They all made it there through connections it seems.<br>Cats having broad shoulders, rounded butts, no snout. <br>Oh God......"
"IT Chapter 2: I&#39;m the most terrifying, spine-chilling, nightmare-inducing movie of 2019<br><br>Cats: Hold my beer"
IT chapter two<br>everyone: gonna be the scariest movie of the year<br>Cats<br>:hold my beer
This looks like a face swap with you and your cat
"This should be considered a violent attack on Ian McKellen, our own national treasure"
Typed in Cats to see cat videos to cheer up.<br>......<br>youtube: got just the thing for you.
Sonic: We&#39;ve created the worst nightmare fuel ever!<br>Cats: Hold my catnip...
"Oh, they made a movie about my sleep paralysis demons."
"Almost two years later, this movie made me realise something: God had not abandoned us, we have abandoned him."
"Showed this to my Cat, She’s a dog now."
Me: &quot;Mom can I have a cat?&quot;<br>Mom: &quot;We have <b>Cats</b> at home&quot;<br><b>Cats</b> at home:
"WHY, are they releasing a Horror movie, on Christmas??"
"Proof that Humans evolved from Cats and not Monkeys, honestly this film looks amazing."
What if they make a movie called &quot;humans&quot; and it&#39;s just regular people with cat faces?
I clicked on this and went straight to the comments.
Me: mom can we go watch Garfield <br><br>Mom: We have Garfield at home<br><br>Garfield at home:
Who came here searching for the legendary &quot;If I pirated this movie I would still ask for a refund&quot;
I can&#39;t wait! I just need to find a theater that offers rollercoaster seat restraints and psychedelic drugs so I can get the full experience.
“This Holiday Season you will believe.”<br>I believe God has abandoned us because we’ve created sin
"I fear no man, but that thing..... it scares me"
"Guys stop complaining abou this trailer, my friend died and i put this trailer in the  hospital&#39;s tv, he lived again and turned off the tv"
I fear no man. But that thing...<br><br><br><b>LEANS FORWARD</b><br><br><br><br><br><b>IT SCARES ME</b>
All I can ask is<br><br>“Is this what the crazy cat ladies see?”
So you’re telling me all these talented people thought this was a good idea
"<b>Mistakes Make You Stronger</b><br><br><br><br>The Director After Making The Movie: <b>hulk</b>"
Just when you thought Mike Myers as the Cat in the Hat couldn&#39;t be anymore nightmare fuel.....
The trailer doesn&#39;t explain the movie at all it&#39;s just a bunch of cats singing and dancing around the place
This is the scariest horror movie trailer I have EVER seen. No way IT: Chapter 2 can beat this or anything else for that matter.
The end is near. Tell your family you love them.
"me: mom, can we have a cat?<br>mom: no, we have cats at home<br><b>cats at home:</b>"
i forgot about this trailer so i came back here to laugh at the comments
God and I thought I wanted to die after i saw live action sonic
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U&amp;t=7"">0:07</a> the second i saw this trailer i was watching with my sister. This was the hardest ive laughed in my entire life i think"
When you faceswap with your pet
You know it&#39;s bad when even the furry community is disturbed.
That is the creepiest thing I’ve seen this year. WTF?
If aliens ever got ahold of this it would set their research back hundreds of years
"&quot;This Christmas, you will believe&quot;. I believe a group of Producers are soon to be fired."
After CATS trailer got 200k + Dislike<br><br><br><br>Sonic Trailer: Cha Cha Real Smooth
"This trailer sent me to therapy, and mostly because I&#39;ll never be able to look at Gandalf the same way again"

This’ll be like that Christmas present you get from your creepy uncle.
"Someone get ian mckellen out of there. Put him back in the Gandalf robes and hat, immediately."
Sonic tried to warn us with &quot;uuh meow?&quot; But we were all blind
How was the movie ? It’s been four years and I’ve never even heard of this. I found this trailer randomly lol
I’m gonna quote something that JacksFilms said:<br><br><br><br>WHY COULDN’T THEY WEAR COSTUMES!?
"Elder Scrolls 6 looks dope, these Khajhit look so Realistic!"
"People in 1951: we will have flying cars in the future <br>2019:<br><br><br><br><br><br>EDIT: Er sorry about the year, fixed it up. Plus thanks for likes<br>ANOTHER EDIT: it doesn’t creep me out, but I do find it a smidge odd, I see why it scares people but I think dance is good just look"
I was expecting this to be people in costumes and makeup and be taking place in a junkyard so it would have the same feel as the stage musical and the 1998 movie did.
1980: We will have flying cars in 2019 <br><br>2019:
Just a quick explanation.<br>They look this horrific because this is the cheapest way to turn actors into cats without modelling cat faces and new body shapes. You could say the same for the sonic movie.<br><br>As the FBI we&#39;re still investigating further though.
Swear they just used the snapchat face-swap  filter with models of khajiits from the elder scrolls
"This movie isn&#39;t trash, It&#39;s an entire junkyard."
This scared me more than the IT Chapter Two trailer
This is the worst thing to happen on cats since dogs<br>-Ricky Gervais
I think what’s sad is that someone had to watch this before releasing it and still thought it was a good idea😑
Words cant describe how much I love this film but numbers can -10000/10
We have angered God and this is our punishment.
If you ever feel like no one will accept you think of this <br><br>This movie had to be approved by hundreds of people.😐
You don’t smile. You don’t frown. You just stare blankly in horror...
Happy 5th Anniversary to the Cats trailer!
This was a hilarious joke guys.... but April Fools was months ago.
"<b>This Christmas, you will believe</b> <br>At least Universal got one thing right; I now DO believe... <br><br><br>that hell exists"
Time to figure out which of the producers is a secret furry
They should have cast Megan Markle to really put the cherry of horror on top. 😂
"Attention all gamers, THE FURRYS ARE FIGHTING BACK!"
This makes black Christmas look like a family night movie...
This is what happens when you inject  liquid cocaine into the veins of your minimum wage employees
"Son : Why do cat faces look the same, dad?<br>Dad : Because it&#39;s scary if their faces are different from each other"
I am trying to figure out what I just witnessed.
Hey...Elon?<br>This is not what we meant when we said &quot;create cat girls&quot;...
Wanna break up with your girlfriend take her to this movie
"The executives : &quot;People love cat videos so much, lets make a movie about humanoid cats. They will love it even more.&quot;"

"Shrek walks up<br>&quot;this is the part&quot; *blows out torch &quot;where the investors, run away&quot;"

This bombed so bad it should be held on trial in The Hague for crimes against humanity.
i took my girlfriend to this movie in theatres. I don’t have a girlfriend anymore
"&quot;Do you think God stays in heaven because he, too, lives in fear of what he&#39;s created?&quot;"
&quot;This holiday season you will believe&quot; that practical effects are better than cg.  Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
"I dont understand y all anymore , you dont want people to be cats bcs it looks terrifying , y all dont want real cats bcs you dont like the animation . THEN WHAT DO Y ALL LIKE? :))"
"The uncanny valley reminds me of the live action Sonic trailer.  Except ironically, it doesn’t have anyone going “Uh... Meow?”"
our kids are gonna look back at 2019 in the future and say “wtf is this”
there&#39;s gonna be some really messed up fanfaction made about this isn&#39;t there oh god
The entire movie plot: hoomans dressed as cats singing every 0.1 seconds
why am I scared? should I be scared? I never thought they could successfully make a horror musical. well they did it. congrats
This movie should&#39;ve been animated instead. <br><br>I mean COMPLETELY animated like Toy Story. Not filmed in front of a green screen and put into post for 5 or 6 years.
I felt more comfortable getting hit by a car than watching this video.
I came for the trailer and stayed for the comments. <br><br>I was not disappointed.
I showed this to my therapist and I think he needs therapy.
You know...maybe that movie version of Sonic didn&#39;t look that bad after all...
"&quot;This Christmas, you will believe&quot; Yes, I will believe that god has deserted us for good"
"I used to be a cat person. After watching this trailer, I&#39;m not even sure if I&#39;m a person."
"You were so preoccupied that you could, you didn&#39;t stop to think if you should.<br>  - Ian Malcolm<br><br>Edit: thanks for the likes!"
Thanks to this trailer I had a dream last night that my cat began to walk on it&#39;s back legs and sing to me
"If they added longer fur it would look 110% better. The Broadway actors would always have fur attached to their face and it looked great, more like cats. Also, people loves cats for the costumes and makeup not everything has to be cgi"
"I come here often to cheer myself up, every time I mess things up."
Parents : KIDS LOOK AWAY<br><br>Kids: Why? It says PG<br><br>Parents: ......... because I said so
IF YOU JUST ADD A CAT NOSE IT WOULD BE 80% LESS HORRIFYING!! ITS SO SIMPLE!!!
"Don&#39;t worry guys, there&#39;ll be eight sequels to this movie.<br><br><br>Edit: Nine lives"
"If the cats union saw this movie, they would hate and despise all the humans and start moving away from them in the forests returning to their bigger siblings....<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>but then returning with all of them... &quot;Sarge, let’s charge on them!!!!!”...."
I thought Universal gave up on the Dark Universe after the Mummy reboot failed
So these actors had to wear full body green suits for this entire movie <br>Imagine how much they much hated themselves for deciding to be in this movie.
"After we raid Area 51, can we please raid Universal Studios."
<b>&quot;This is the worst thing to happen to cats since dogs&quot; - Ricky Gervais</b>
These aren’t the cat girls I was expecting at Area 51
My cat ran away from me after watching this trailer. For some reason
Man... I usually try to reserve judgement until I see all of it but man I don’t have high expectations for this
"Fun fact: i had to sit through this shit with my mom 3 Christmases ago.<br><br><br>And unsurprisingly, we both hated it."
this brings a whole new meaning to the word “furry”
What cat girls in anime look like vs what they actually look like
"This is going to awaken so many furries, jesus Christ"
I don&#39;t have a problem with this. It&#39;s the stage musical that makes me feel uneasy.
I see they finally made a movie about the family of cats from Chernobyl
The government is trying to tell us that celebrities aren&#39;t lizards in fact they are actually cats
I can understand why Thanos wanted to shred the universe to it&#39;s last Atom..
Hey that asteroid that killed the dinosaurs… I’m ready for ours.
James Corden is in every movie that people hated<br><br>1. Emoji Movie<br>2. Cats<br>3. Peter Rabbit<br>4. Trolls<br>5. Small Foot<br><br>Edit: bruh 281 likes howwww
Satan looks under his bed every night to make sure these things are not there.
Dr Phil: So you’re telling me... You went naked with cat fur all over your body in public.
&quot; this is the worst thing to happen to cats since dogs&quot;
"Some of them have fur, But please tell me why some of them look...<br><br><br><br>...SMOOTH."
We gotta stop these people from their crack addictions
I think we all owe Mike Myer&#39;s cat in the hat an apology
This film was cursed from the moment they put James Cordon’s name first in the credits.
"I’ve never felt such a strange combination of pity, and indigestion."
These are not the cat girls that I wanted to find in Area 51
Lets just appreciate the fact that people actually decided to like this video
Manga: lackadaisy comic<br>Anime: lackadiasy cartoon <br>Netflix adaptation:
“CALL THE NAVY!”<br><br>“Meow”<br><br>“THE CATS HAVE TAKEN OVER THE NAVY!”<br><br>“NOT THE NAVY!!!!!”
Suddenly the sonic movie is looking a whole lot better.
It looks like the cat in the hat had a litter with the lion from the wizard of Oz.
This is the &#39;Madame Web&#39; of Broadway musicals adapted to the big screen.
This is literally what Satan checks under his bed for before he goes to sleep... even he can’t handle those abominations lol
Um animal control yeah we gotta problem
They should rename this &quot;Snapchat filter: The movie.&quot;
Wow someone actually said this is a good idea and the production team went along with it
"When even Taylor stans are not liking this, you know you goofed up."
"honestly, <br><br>IF U CLOSE UR EYES<br><br>it sounds good<br><br>but when u open them up,<br><br>💀💀"
"IDRIS MY G U COULD OF BEEN JAMES BOND BOSSMAN, WHY A CAT"
If I only watched the first ten seconds of the trailer and known little else about this movie I would have thought it was a high-budget porno...
The story line seems like it would be good but the cgi.... Umm no

Why the frick does the white cat look like James charles
Are these the failed experiments of Area 51? They have to be!

Our cat is no longer interacting with humans after watching this movie.
"If cats would&#39;ve done a movie called Humans, they would certainly do a better job."
I saw this &quot;movie&quot; on Christmas of 2019 after my partner and I had a bottle of wine and numerous blunts. It was still barely enough. I&#39;ll never forget the audible groan from the audience when Dame Judi Dench looked at the camera at the end of the film for the final number.
"Is everyone ignoring the fact that these cats have human nose, oh jesus I don&#39;t think I will ever recover from this"
i really wanna know a furry’s opinion on this abomination
Me: Mom can we get 2 cats<br>Mom: We have cats at home <br>Cats af home
"I saw this movie in cinema and i never felt so uncomfortable about character&#39;s design, but it was funny"
Why does James cordon have to be a furry in every goddamn movie lol
129k People Were So Scared They Hit the Like Button on Accident
"Imagine this but but the cats actually look like cats, that would be nice lmao"
"When people in the future study zero rate interest phenomens of the 2010s, this will be in every single textbook that covers the topic."
This actually made me uncomfortable watching. Like I feel violated 😖
"also, I wish Jason Derulo&#39;s line will just be him singing &quot;Jason Derulo&quot;"
I wonder how painful it was for Jason derulo not to be able to yell his own name
Dog fans: furry wolves<br>Cat fans: cats movie
"Why don&#39;t they have cat faces. Why don&#39;t they have cat faces. <b>They have human faces on cat bodies, it isn&#39;t correct.</b> <b>I DO NOT LIKE HUMAN FACE ON CAT BODY.</b>"
"<i>Khajiit has wares, if you have coin</i>"
I just  can&#39;t accept that the director of Les Miserables did this.
It went from great musical to a nightmare fuel...
Me : hey I kinda like the movie trailer<br><br>My brother : <b>signs me up for therapy</b>
I don&#39;t think even the Furries wanted anything to do with this.
"Sum of them are wearing fur jackets, like what ? 🤨"
When you wanted anime cat girls but you got this instead:
Wow real life cat-girls<br>-Elon Musk has entered the chat
And we all thought the first sonic trailer was bad
"“This Holliday Season , You will believe” .... that this film lost 90 million dollars."
"I was pretty sad when the Warrior cats movies were always delayed. Now, after I&#39;ve seen this, I think it&#39;s maybe for good."

the trailer scares the shite outta me istg wth it&#39;s like an underlying jumpscare is ready to happen and it keeps me so tense-
Such an amazing cast but with a movie like this- nothing can save It o-o
This will be better if it just a human musical that have a Victorian era settings or aesthetic
"If only cats knew about this atrocity, they would never want to be our pets."
"they went through the long process of this movie getting the actors, making the script, etc etc, AND NO ONE ASKED THE QUESTION: “WTF ARE WE EVEN DOING HERE?!”"
"I remember sitting in the theater for “Christopher Robin”, watching the trailers for new movies coming out, and getting frozen with terror as soon as this one came on"
"If you think about it long enough, this movie is essentially a revival of those medieval European cat paintings. Some weird and uncanny things just couldn&#39;t change even with the ease of modernity we all have now."
"I couldn&#39;t watch the trailer for a nano second before holding my phone at arm&#39;s length, getting off the trailer, and deleting my search and watch history while washing my eyes"
i love this movie and i’m not ashamed
This movie: Exists<br><br><br>The last airbender:  Am I a joke to you?
Still not understand why people hate this movie.
Every single person involved in the production of this movie should be embarrassed.
"The only place I wanted them to take this was to have actually realistic looking animated cats performing the musical as the actual animal would do. I don&#39;t think the creators even knew what cats looked like. They&#39;re giving cats a bad name because cats are cute, they are not cat-human-monkey hybrids"
Why did I search this up I think I am permanentally scarred
My eyes! My eyes! I want to put out my eyes after watching this.
"&quot;This Christmas, you will believe.&quot;<br>Its 2022 and I still don&#39;t"
Is anyone else here after the Chip &#39;n Dale trailer
This is we forget our dreams <br><br>Because this is what is them and we&#39;d lose our sanity if we remember them
This trailer is the perfect definition of &quot;Uncanny Valley&quot;
Happy on 40 anniversary Cats ! :)
"The lesson from this is quite simple, and one that has constantly been forgotten by Hollywood: Use the right medium for your story. Some things just shouldn&#39;t be live action, or cgi, or whatever. I can think of many absolute dud live action movies that would have undoubtedly been spectacular had they been animated. Tank Girl, for instance, imagine if that movie had been done entirely in the style of the short 2D animated bit partway through the movie. Just imagine all of this music coupled with lively traditional animation like the kind america used to know how to do."
"&quot;From Academy Award Winning Director<br>Tom Hooper&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br>Where&#39;s your Academy Award trophy now, Tom?"
I literally had to watch this movie in a shitty theater with a chair thats so upright that when i slouch to realx myself a bit the chair closes on my face turning me into a sandwhich -_-
"This movie isn&#39;t a movie,its just a music video,such a bruh moment"
Even I disliked this when it came out and I can&#39;t even remember doing that 💀
"After all this years,this trailer still haunts me,please free me from the haunting this trailer gave me"
This will make every furry second guess themselves.
R.I.P. the dislikes.
Some one said on twitter that &quot;this is the worst thing happened to cats after the dogs&quot;😭
This makes the emoji movie look like an oscar winner
Andrew Lloyd Webber will be putting his foot down on Hollywood from attempting to make any more Film Adaptations of his work after Cats was a failure.
I come here to watch this every year just to feel the pain. 🗿
I cringed so hard at this.....<br><br><br><br><br>I now have wrinkles
"r/cursedcomments<br>r/TIHI<br>r/cursedimages <br><br>Reddit, here we come!!!"
This is why covid happened
I forgot this movie existed
"You know what, maybe &quot;Pixels&quot; (2015) isn&#39;t so bad after all."
its like if coffee and nightmares had a baby
The movie was very good. A lot of people worked very<br>hard to make this movie. The untalented small people<br>making negative comments are useless. They produce<br>no art of their own to be reviewed.
Is this what realistic furrys would look like?
Here in 2024 questioning who’s idea it was to fuse humans with cats
This happens when movie companies need to stop putting celebrities in their films to think it&#39;ll come out great. This bombs.
Musicals were way better back in the day.
lmao i cannot stop laughing at this trailer
"Four years after this movie came out, i&#39;m grateful that Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman turned down a role in this movie due to their busy schedules. Two of the most respectable actors working today doesn&#39;t deserve to be in this and i&#39;m so glad they didn&#39;t get the roles for this movie"
This movie was so bad I saw it on a flight and people still walked out
"I saw the Cats Musical in the 1990s, when folks had class and appreciated Art. First view The Cats movie on Netflix. I love the Cats Movie. Now my favorite. ❤"
Budget: $95 mln<br>I have no more questions...
My grandma is actually watching this movie right now...
"not gonna lie... I kinda like this movie. I fully acknowledge that it’s bizarre and that some of the performances (rebel wilson and james corden) are abismal at best, BUT I still find a good amount of enjoyment in this movie. i think some of the music is done pretty well done, like skimbleshanks’ song as well as the intro song. I think a lot of people went into this movie wanting to hate it but that isn’t really fair and doesn’t do justice to the real performers who put a lot of work into it. I also don’t even think the CGI is that bad I think people need to get over themselves lmao"
OK hear me out I think this would have been a lot better as an animation
All the cat killers are rubbing their hands together watching this
This makes me realize The Scorpion King wasn&#39;t so badly animated.
I must be the only one who likes this film 😭😭😭😭
Doja Cat&#39;s face when she&#39;s not invited to the movie: 👁👄👁
"Oscars: Hi, uh, is this tom hooper<br>Tom:Yes<br>Oscars:We would like that golden award we gave you back"
"My cat saw me this watching, and now I don&#39;t have a cat."
Not one litter box in this whole trailer
"Cats r hot as hell and good singing/dancing, i dont get y ppl hate this movie."
Imagine all life in earth goes extinct and aliens need to find proof and this is the only proof
"Music is great, but who the hell decided it would be a good idea to have cats with human faces and proportions"
Who made this and… why…. this traumatises forever😂
Best thing to say about it is that it’s not as bad as Cuties
The trailer made it look so good
Imagine the animators behind Lackadaisy reanimating this entire movie.
This is the worst thing happened to cats after dogs. <br>- Ricky Gervais
Universal Pictures is terrified to present <br>One of the most disappointed motion pictures of the year<br>The winner of six Golden Raspberry Awards<br>Including Worst Picture
I tried watching this on Netflix.<br><br>I got about 10 minutes in and I wondered &quot;Why the hell am I watching this sober?&quot;
Mom...i dont want chase to live with us anymore....
Who would have thought you see Idris Elba as a Cat Falling onto Nelsons column  from above 😀😺😺
I must be insane because I love this movie
I didn&#39;t believe that a whole movie can made with instagram filter.<br>Until I saw this.
Dude when everybody says it’s so bad I feel like its not
Only realised today that this came out the same year as Rise of Skywalker.<br><br>Covid started in 2019 and was somehow only the 3rd worst thing to come out of that year.
this is what 2020 is in 1 video
Cat in the Hat was right his world is scary
This has to be the most disturbing movie of alltime
Happy on 40 anniversary Cats Musical ! :)
I really don&#39;t know how to feel about this-
Congratulations on 40 anniversary Cats Musical ! :)
"Cats was a good movie. It was not the best ever made, but I enjoyed it enough to put it on my favorite movies playlist."

The best part is that this trailer is better than the actual movie
ok is no one gonna comment on the fact that the song in the trailer legit just goes &#39;toooooooooouch meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee&#39;<br>u telling me no one was like &quot;tf did we just make&quot;?????????
"Day 1 after watching this movie: gets instant depression that&#39;s heavier than your mon<br><br>Day 2. I started drinking the living soul out of me<br><br>Day 3. Haven&#39;t slept all night cus of the cocaïne<br><br>Day 4. Went to do groceries,when the guy behind me pushed me, I fell with my wrist on the counter and discovered that I am a pack of oreos<br><br>Day 5. Finally hangs myself"
the singer: TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUCCCCHHHH MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>Me: wtf
This film reminds me of when I saw a cat with a human face I’ll never forget it I was traumatised lol
It could has been worse: the hardrives might have been stolen and the people who worked on the CGI would have been forced to reanimate the whole thing.
"My cat saw me this watching, Now she don&#39;t wanna be a cat."
An advert to see an advert. Of course Universal is monetising Cats right here!
Hollywood after midnight 😼
"Okay, so my friends told me to read cats book but I just decided to watch the movie instead so I typed this up and saw this...creepy"
I don’t know how to feel about these human cats
Anime cat girls:cute and nice <br><br>Cat girls in real life:
"I don’t know why everyone’s complaining, it’s was very funny and I also cry...<br>Well I was high as fuck so that make sense."
Who tf did they let cook in the studio.
sometimes i ponder HOW much they paid taylor to be in this
I believe life was better before my sister showed me this...
A modern day classic 😊
even though it was pirated still would need a refund
"Seriously, everyone, can we all erase any &amp; all traces of this thing from existence?<br>For the good of humanity?!"
"what is this. i am so  genuinely scared, that i swear when i go to sleep ill see those things in my dreams and when i wake up ill have a heart attack, you wont understand, this is traumatizing."
"When i watch the movie, i felt sleepy. All they do is just sing. 🥱"
Imagine if this was the last relic left of humanity’s existence after an extinction-
Thank God I got an add before the video played
This is so terrifying even Satan is trembling
Yep still has terrifying has the first the day I saw this trailer.
"I came here after hearing Ricky Gervais s comment about this piece of... Art  at the Oscars,     I wish I just took his word for it."
"COVID-19: I fear no man<br><br><b>This movie</b><br><br>COVID-19: But that thing, it scares me"
Cats as humans and realistic…..most people say that’s creepy but….I AGREE!I still want to see it though
COVID 19 was a punishment because THIS!
I gave my cat away after watching this
I really wanna know what ACTUAL cats would think of this
Trailer in 2019 and a year later...<br><br>Coincidence?
Half of the budget was spent on crack for the animators
I must be the only one who’s okay with this. I think everything’s fine. Nothing to get offended by.
4 years since this released.
This trailer Gives me an itch on my leg only a 22-gauge rifle can get rid of
“The worst thing that happened to cats... since dogs”
Welp the furrys are gonna love this 😃
I think why people get upset about the film is that artistry of the film is misunderstood. It is  a digital adaptation of a broadway hit. Its not suppose to be like a regular animated film. Its an 80&#39;s broadway classic for the big screen.
That&#39;s enough internet for the week. Think i may fast for a few days as well.<br><br>What type of sickness causes a fever so irrationally high in temperature that it begins to slowly kill brain cells? The writers/producers/actors may need to be checked.
Youtube rewind 2020:

I loved the part where Lion-O shows up at the end. Thundercats!
NGL this was a GOOD movie<br><br><br><br>said <b>no one</b> ever

If the corona virus watched this it will die
This movie was so bad that the composer had to take a therapy dog because he was traumatized 😭
maybe the old sonic design wasn’t so bad😭😭
I’m literally just here for the comments
i honestly just wanna know how the actors were thinking while making this movie.
they took the word “furry” to another level
How the fuck could they not see that is was a bad idea is beyond understanding.
To think someone had to watch this and approve it
How much did they have to pay Taylor Swift?
how is this not classified as a horror movie
"I just put the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE Official TVC: For the fans song in the trailer<br><br><br><br><br><br>not gonna lie, it made it less boring"
I remember seeing this film and I was like&quot; this is gotta be the weirdest movie I have ever seen&quot;
I showed this to my niece and she tried to send her cat to the pound. Especially James cordons character I had to explain people think he is talented too.
"Alright, time to wash my eyes with some good ol&#39; nekomimi hentai :&#39;)"
They lucky YouTube took down the dislikes lmao
"As a cat lover, I feel somehow insulted."
"There was not a good way of doing this right, even with the amazing cast and good intentions behind."
If i ever wanted to shave i would watch this trailer so i wont regret it.
"Guys, do yourself a favor, and watch this while being drunk, its fucking hilarious"
The unofficial prequel to The Cat In The Hat
"Reminder that this movie so bad, God sent a plague a year later."
"Okay, who was the madman that thought this would be a good idea?"
Happy on 40 anniversary Musical ! :)
Saw cats on Broadway.   What&#39;s wrong with the film?! The dancers are amazing. Only saw the trailer. What am I missing?! 😢
"To this day, I still can’t figure out WHY they thought there was nothing wrong with the CGI."
This is what was happening inside Super Hans New Year&#39;s eve party 😂
They said this was the worst thing to ever happen to Cats since Dogs
Imma tell my kids this was live-action enchantimals
Wow. Terrible movie aside…Jennifer Hudson singing this song gives me the chills. She is so amazing
"If I were a person knowing nothing about cats and accidentally watched this, I would be traumatized to see cats for the rest of my life"
I think the only good thing to come out of this movie is the trailer music 😂
I love cats I&#39;ve got 16 of them. But this movie scares me.
Viewed The Cats Movie twice on Netflix and will view many more times. ❤
Pre-COVID this came out.
What the hell this looks like it came from a slave given Microsoft Paint and the slave was supposed to make a masterpiece.
"See these eyes of green<br>I can stare for a thousand years<br>Colder than the moon<br>It&#39;s been so long<br>Feel my blood enraged<br>It&#39;s just the fear of loosing you<br>Don&#39;t you know my name?<br>Well, you&#39;ve been so long<br>And I&#39;ve been putting out fire....."
"Oh god, where&#39;s Batman when you need him?!"
I lost half of my sanity after watching the entire trailer.
Cant wait for the dogs to come out
Normal people with cat ears would be fine for us
Cats showing in HBO is going to be the only horror movie you will need to watch this year
Everything started going downhill after this film came out.
I can’t believe that Taylor swift was in this and James cordon and Jason derulo
Love how there are more dislikes than likes
How to have nightmare for the rest of your life in 2 minutes and 24 seconds!
this is why I can&#39;t go to sleep at night
All this cast and they decided to make a movie about &quot;CATS&quot;

It&#39;s the the cgi that&#39;s bad.<br><br>It&#39;s the design.
"Apparently, they lost $150 million with this one"
"That ain&#39;t a box office, thats a square inoperability"
This trailer alone was scarier than any horror movie I’ve ever seen.
Better than The Emoji Movie
I&#39;m surprised they haven&#39;t turned off the comment section 😂
Wtf how did I get here
"I used to think this trailer was a tragedy, but now I realize it&#39;s a comedy."
im traumatized now
"if they played this movie on an airplane, people would still walk out on it"
Editors: I ain&#39;t bothered to make this look nice
would this have worked in a disney and life of pets style where the cats are just literal animated cute cats and not reminiscent of furry porn?
"Ok Can people please stop being rude because I enjoyed this movie, I&#39;m allowed to have an opinion, its really disrespectful if you are mean treat everyone with respect!!!"
Shown in Theaters with:<br>The Lion King <br>Overcomer <br>Downton Abbey <br>Abominable <br>Last Christmas
"ThIs cHrIsTMAs , YoU wILL BElIevE."
Came here to see a glimpse of how they lost Sven ...<br><br><br><br><br>...Sventy million dollars 💸
"All I&#39;m going to say is we are in the very last minute of the end of days we are the last generation that God spoke about in the Bible and according to the Bible a generation is only 70 to 80 years and from what the Bible says this generation began when Israel became a nation in one day in the year of 1948 so you add that up and there&#39;s going to be 7 years of tribulation before Jesus Christ returns... lift up your heads and look because your Redemption draweth near, Jesus Christ is coming!!!"
Life went downhill since Cats came out.<br>Coincidence? <br>Doubt it
"When weebs say they want nekomimi human hybrid, they don&#39;t mean this, but this is an example of be careful what you wish for."
I can&#39;t sleep now I know this exist
This traumatized me seeing this when I was a kid
I&#39;m going to congratulate every blind person on this planet for not having the ability to see this
"After seeing the designs for almost 2 hours straight, im pretty sure im developing mental problems."
"When the preview started to open, I low-key thought it was a horror movie💀💀"
So.. looking at the coments and dislikes... what is this movie about? ... Some cats turning into anthopomorphic creatures to sing and dance? I never heard of it until today.
My cat just died after watching this movie
"You&#39;ve heard the expression &#39;a night on the tiles&#39;, have you not? Well, that is probably the key missing ingredient from this move that might have got more bums on seats."
The trailer came out on my birthday
im sorry but who thought this was a good idea for a movie?
Did they really have to use human cats instead of anthropomorphic cats
to everyone hating on cats:<br><br><br>what is so wrong with this movie because i havent seen it.
The day humanity fell into chaos
I just finished watching this movie for the 3rd time<br>What the hell am I doing<br>And why do I watch the credits with a grin on my face every time
Film was so bad god done sent a plague a Month later 😭
What&#39;s wrong? I thought you all wanted catgirls.
This movie gave me covid
lets forget this ever happened
I don’t understand why everyone was freaking out they’re not actually scary a little uncanny but seriously it’s just like a weird live action Disney movie
The Movie &quot;CATS&quot; is Amazing Beyond Belief. ❤ ❤ ❤
"like dont lie the soundtrack is amazing but sis, a movie..."
I bet half of the budget was for the crack
I bet Andrew was furious 😂
Just imagine this could’ve have been a great movie with the cast but they made........this
"We will remember this not only it’s bad, because it has haunted our souls"
they had to spend half the movie budget on crack for the actors
A review said :This is the worst thing that happened to cats since dogs
this movie cursed the entire year
I wonder why does this have more dislikes then likes
I really thought Jesus was gonna come back after this movie released
I think we all know...<br>You came here to dislike the video
Shining example of how the Uncanny Valley can break a movie!
MY EYES! MY EYES!
The money spent to make this monstruosity surpasses the GDP of Paraguay. I feel there is something terribly wrong here.
This year is the 40th anniversary of the musical this......thing is based on.
the world has been getting progressively worse at an accelerated pace since
It deserves Ricky Javer&#39;s roast.😂😂😂
&quot;motion capture put me in a bad light&quot;
i was happiest man before i knew this existed
The best way to wash his trailer and this movie is drunk because you don&#39;t focus on the bad CGI
Jason Derulo said that he wants to want Himself for the film
This movie wasn&#39;t supposed to be made
The only way the film of Cats would have not ended up as a total war crime is if Hollywood had given Studio Ghibli a big bag of money and final cut
I searched “horror” and this came up!!
Ngl still up at 1am laughing at how bad this movie is 2.8 on IMDb is as worst as it gets
"Apart that a theatre event musical without a story does not translate to silvercreen, these werecats are ghastly. <br><br>They should have gone full cgi and do the faces too. <br><br>But showing that african american skin was a Must. Inclusion is box office poison."
"Imagine going to the horror movie like &quot;Us&quot;, but it ends up being mildly scary at best cause some cats trailer before the movie is more of a nightmare fuel than any shit afterwards..."
What expect to be difference between this terrific CGI and the TeenZ (Dark unicorn Vs Rainbow unicorn)?
Why is this version Jennifer Hudson but the official released version isnt and there isnt any version with just jennifer hudson and no dialogue?
Hey should we make these look like cats or humans?<br><br><br><br><br>Yes
What’s next? Live action Shrek?
Fun fact there are two shot to the groin jokes in this movie…….
this project feels like in half progress they just realized that this was a dogshit idea but to lazy for a turn back
<b>This movie is just a fever dream with furries</b>
Imagine knowing the dislikes on this Video?<br>Ahhh Good times.
I still CANNOT believe this was a movie
The most horrifying horror movie I&#39;ve ever seen.
"Movie is what it is, about a bunch of dead cats competing for reincarnation. So they get new life. Egyptian religion based, hence the bar they frequent. With splash of Catholics added in. Cats are thought to live in both worlds of living and the dead simultaneously."
More terrifying than <i>Felidae.</i>
Why didn&#39;t they just make this with NORMAL CGI cats?
And you thought catwoman was a bad movie.
When this trailer dropped nearly 3 years ago that was a true cultural reset. We all together were absolutely horrified of this absolute disaster.
Anakin Skywalker &quot;no&quot;<br><br>Yoda &quot;do or do not there is no try&quot;
"ah, yes.<br><br>nightmare fuel"
"The whole comment section : &quot;terrible movie&quot; , dissing the producer blah blah.<br>Me : who jus can to see Taylor and other talented actors...👁️👄👁️🤧🤧😩👀📈📈🤯🤯🤯😐😐😐🤒🌚🌚🌚🌚 bye. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank u Next!"
2020 is our punishment for this movie.
One of the very few videos that has more dislikes than likes
I watched this movie on meth and it was the best thing ever
How the hell did they get taylor swift or even Idris Elba to star in this movie or Heck how did this get past the animation team like it went through so many people including the director and not even ONE of them thought &quot;Yeah this is a bad idea&quot;
I am here because of birthmoviesdeath article about Rob Sheridan going to see this movie on shrooms. What the hell did i just watch?
Still have yet to see it any good? 😁😬
"If i swith the number in the dislike rational, i can assume everyone liked it (yes ik you dont like the &quot;cats&quot; movie, its just my brain)"
"My mom bringed me to watch this 3 years ago, and im sitting there confused glad it&#39;s over! Longest 2 hours of my life watching this film.."
Jason A. Lol😂
Wait this movies real and I didn’t trip into a bag of cocaine
This is if Gacha people with cat ears were real
This movie disturbing and horrifying
Ever since this movie came out things went to shit for the rest of the world. That is not a coincidence
It&#39;s the worst thing that happened to cats since dog.
"I thought i would never to urged, to blow my self in the head with a 9m 💀"
Remember if it has james gordon it ain&#39;t good
I can’t even think of an insult to give this movie because I have so many ways to make fun of it
"Genie: “You have three wishes.”<br>Person: “I wish this movie never existed.”<br>Genie: “You still have three wishes, that wish is on me.”"
Yay! I got a bob ross ad!
Wow so much hate...I actually quite enjoyed this movie but it&#39;s not the first time I have loved what everyone else hates...
(Two years later)<br><br>IN THE HEIGHTS saved us
"I&#39;m gonna be honest... I love cats.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Not the movie, the movie fucking sucked, but the animals based after the movie are really great."
Why was this popular as a play???
I imagine this might actually be a personal hell for some.
Why did I rewatch this?
LISTEN TO THE HATERS  💪💪💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥‼‼‼‼💯💯
Its just humans wearing cat costume for Halloween
How the the fuck is there more 139k likes!?
this is more terrifying than most horror movies
You have to think twice about releasing it man
i made a new account as it logged me out and after this being the first video i watched it recommended me horror movies right after
Cats VS Food fight VS The Emoji Movie. Would you buy tickets?
"I have to assume the movie sucked as badly as the trailer. Clearly, Cats was a dog. <br>This is a great way to keep people out of the theaters."
"Is this the greatest fear of Luz Noceda from the Owl House, besides telling her mother?"
POV: you came here for the comments
Yay! Elon musk is making catgirls!<br>Catgirls:
but im happy theyre enjoying shooting this movie
This is what I&#39;m thinkng when I have fever
I thought would be watching a trailer of movie about cats but wtf is thus
This is a furry convention&#39;s dream
I honestly forgot this movie even existed
Francesca Hayward is one hott little kitty.  ... meow!!
"Don&#39;t worry, I only came to see Taylor Swift in the trailer"
I mean they should just call this Scary Movie 6
Everyday we stray further from god
"Well, there goes the plan to watch this movie"
140k likes! I bet this movie was loved by many
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U&amp;t=87"">1:27</a> Oscarbait so much....!!!!!!!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<br>They really try soooo HARD to win that shitty oscar XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD"
"Jason Derulo, T Swift and Gandalf in the same film... ???"
This is why we can&#39;t have nice things
This is the worst thing to happen to cats since dogs
Im questioning my existence
"ME before watching: No movie can be shit, all movies have something good about &#39;em!<br>Also me: ....................................................****!"
I’m genuinely terrified
Universal took furry&#39;s to a whole new level.
I think most people came here to find out how this is...
I REALLY LOVE ALL THE SONGS IN THIS MOVIE!!
"Whats next Bunnies YAS they should hop around the whole thing I would be so grateful, (Prays)"
Dam man I shouldn&#39;t have watched this late in the night now am scared someone hug me
I’m scared
Did they actually think it was a good idea?
Is this for childs right?
Maybe this was the reason for 2020 everything in?
I know if  people hate musical movies and cats uncanny Valley design but that&#39;s ok
The effort they made is clearly visible but the results are truly terrible ⭐️
Maybe Nekopara wasnt that bad.
That certainly would of made me die in a bad trip if I was on acid
Damn you Andrew Lloyd Webber for starting us down this road!
this should have been an animated movie
What’s wrong with humanity these days?
This is an absolute monstrosity how did 140k people like this
I called this movie the &quot;Meow Mix&quot; movie!!!🐱🐾
Cats is buffet for Melmac
i would rather gouge out my eyes tham watch this
Should be rated 18+
"the composition of the trailer is actually very well done. It&#39;s a wonderfully cut trailer...it&#39;s just the the visuals are from a horror movie. Like if I couldn&#39;t see the visuals, i would have a very different opinion of this.<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23releasethebuttholecut"">#releasethebuttholecut</a> 😹😹😹😹😹😹"
it hurts.... IT HURTTSSSS
Who just looked at this movie and was like “yep this is perfect 🤩”
This is truly terrifying
this is 2 whole mins of try not to cringe challenge guys
Not the cats and human hybrids 😭
Reminder that Cats: the movie was the last major film released before the word went to shit<br><br><br><br>Coincidence? Maybe...<br><br>Maybe not...
I watch this daily
I&#39;m still wondering how those cats in that movie mate.
Why do people hate this so much? I know nothing about cats
"It sucks that this got a lot of hate  cause the play cats is really good, just wish they wouldve changed the design so it didnt have the terrible cgi"
LOL
Catgirls we wanted VS catpeople we get: <br><br>😑
so this is what started the coronavirus
The cast are all illuminati allstars
"And they wonder why it flopped. <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/RPkfY8TPGsCakNAP-JWAoAQ""></a>"
lmao what an insult to literal cats.
this is what people think furries are like
is it weird that i acctually like this movie?
What&#39;s wrong with the trailer? Why so many dislikes? There are multiple genres and their fans. But what&#39;s wrong with it?
Did this originate from those old PSAs?
oh god im only just now watching this for the first time and they made them <b>small</b><br>if your gonna make them people cats make them people sized
This movie must be in darkweb
I wanted to see this movie
this was one of the worst experiences of my life. just what in the absolute fuck were they thinking
they shouldn&#39;t add taylor swift into this.
Ah. Spoiled milk
Come on Hollywood 😔
I completely forgot this movie existed.... I&#39;m glad I never watched it.
This would be a useful tool in interrogation
I can’t even tell what this is about
Holy s*** what am I sering
"ขอให้ &quot;องค์พระสัมมาสัมพุทธเจ้า&quot; ทรงช่วยคุ้มครอง<br>น้องของขวัญให้ปลอดภัยแคล้วคลาดด้วยครับ<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%B8"">#สาธุสาธุสาธุ</a>"
This is what weebs get when they ask for a cat girl.
what is this lmao
"Si no fuera porque amo el musical original y me encanta el teatro, danza, cinematografía y todo eso no hubiese visto la película con ese trailer"
I remember watching this in theatre I literally waited in the bathroom for 20 minutes cause how shit it was
I&#39;m pretty sure everything going wrong since 2020 is because us humans made this unholy movie.
128 bit cats be like
Ngl I went to the cinema on opening night to see this &amp; I absolutely loved it 💗 Still do 😻😻😻
Is it bad?
They could have made realistic CGI cats...
<i>Wow vr has gotten to real</i>
"I can tell the cast was trying their best. If you wanted better, fix the characters of JennyAnyDots and Bustopher Jones, and use practical costumes instead of CGI fur, make the mice and cockroaches puppets/toys, and make Idris Elba’s Macavitymore villainous instead of making him bumbling at times. Is it that hard Hooper?"
Welcome to Kittylandia or Catslandia.
"I may be the only person on this planet who actually ENJOYED this movie. lol Indeed, I will even go so far as to say that this version of Cats is BETTER than The Lion King (live action one) Garfield, The Cat in the Hat, Catwoman and Cats and Dogs. And its FAR better (at least singing-wise) than Les Miserables or Phantom of the Opera (the one with Gerard Butler as the Phantom)."
Whoever got this idea should be put in mental asylum
IM SO CREPED OUT EWW WAIT WHAT
"Ok. I need to know. Am I the only one who thinks sexy cat Taylor Swift is actually... sexy? Please, someone, agree with me!"
"IN THE NAME OF THE GOD EMPEROR, I DECLARE EXTERMINATUS"
Still a better movie than Crocodile Dundee
Better than the Kings Speech
So im the only one who came cuase of pinguinz?
Well this is gonna haunt my dreams
This makes Morgz look good
"Why make what is essentially a  film of a stage production, instead of just actually filming a stage production? Almost every scene in this film looks like it could have been shot in a theatre. Oddly, I think a photorealistic animated version (a bit like The Polar Express) might have worked better."
MAGNIFICIENT!
"They should’ve made it an animated movie, Puss in Boots style. Or just use real cats."
Uhmm ok. Honestly was expecting worse after reading the comments before watching i guess that secret to avoiding the cringe. My question is ehy did idris alba sign up for this like bro come on😂
Still better than megamid 2 👍
I think im having nightmares tonight
"Whoever thought this was a good idea, uhh............"
"I have a few questions: why? why? why? and, why? just why?"
This movie was so good what you guys sayin
"&quot;I have a question, for god WHYYYYYYYY&quot;"
What&#39;s up jerks!!
"August,2024 Here for Taylor !"
2019 was quite a year for live action😅
"Mike Myers thought this looked stupid.  Yes, really."
"This is torture to watch, I was terrified."
This movie was great! If you can look pass the humanoid cats.
Congratulations on 40 anniversary Cats ! :)
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U&amp;t=94"">1:34</a> oh how the mighty have fallen"
I would have watched this had they shown them cleaning themselves.
They should do a Cats animation movie. This was awlful
What the ...<br><br>- Garfield
"I get this whole thing is like four years old, but I wanted to watch this movie on my birthday last year and got mad when I couldn’t because it wasn’t on anything and I left 1998’s CD at my dad’s…"
Can anyone explain y they cast judy dench as old deuteronomy ?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U&amp;t=53"">0:53</a> What&#39;s wrong with it?"
I bet everyone who wrote and produced this movie was high off of LSD or some type of drugs. Who idea was this on the first place? 🤣💩
Thats why dogs are better
Lol again in 2024!
evanescence bring me to life
Never knew Shane Dawson directed a movie
I dont get it
i don&#39;t know why everybody&#39;s hating on this. i love it... genius!
BEST MOVIES OF 2010s<br>ENDGAME<br>JOHN WICK 3<br>TERMINATOR 6<br>WORST ONES IN 2010s<br>CATS <br>DORA MOVIE<br><br><br>THE DORA MOVIE IS EVEN WORSE
Uh the comment are not turned of<br>Floppy?<br>Lost 72 million dollars 😄🤣
Furries wet dream be like
"Do you ever wonder, what is going in their head?"
I gave up seeing this movie because of the comments
This film created covid when it was released in China
nightmare fuel :)
I liked it
I think this trailer is kinda banging;
Furry&#39;s wet dream:
Who allowed something like this to exist??<br><br>Edit: I am gonna have to file a complaint to god about this.
They should make a horror game based arround this<br><br>It would be a sucess
In Cats (2019)
the movie was like 99% of them are singing and 1% of them are speaking BORINGG
I see why people hate this
I see why people hate this
"What has to be wrong with your brain to think that making a movie like this is a good idea, and after seeing the god awful final product you still decide to release it???"
The cast was one of the best cast ever but the movie was one of the worst movie ever lol
I laughed when I saw this
In December 20
They look goofy asf😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂
"the movie is horrifying , They are even scared"
God has abandoned us.
Satan is that you drag me down with you into the abyss
not even taylor could fix this
... I&#39;m scarred for life
why tf do everyone call this movie a horror movie???
I would’ve died not knowing what doomed us all this god is gonna make us answer for this 😮
"Hating on this film is so NPC, like, why can&#39;t people have their own opinion instead of repeating what other idiots say"
I brought 2 DVDs at Walmart ✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️
"Can someone pls explain me why this trailer got a huge number of dislikes, is the movie bad?? Coz I haven&#39;t watch it yet"
I like it... But I Dont Know Why This Movie Is Get Hated...
Why hasn&#39;t this been removed yet ?
wow good film :..........)
The comments are hilarous...
this is slander to all the actors names
Do you guys know what stairs scene people are so creeped out about?? I’m literally not seeing it and a timestamp would be helpful.
"This was on,y 5 years ago? What!?"
Jennifer&#39;s voice😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
This film is coronavirus vaccine
What am I doing back here
Just literally put a cat infront of the camera and usr cgi&#39;s with human forms is more weirder to audiences
I mean first time I saw this specific trailer I’m like what is this crap? Then Jen Hudson started singing I’m like whoah that sounds good and epic. Nahh it’s still bad lol
I think the CGI would’ve been better if it was actual animation instead of this. This CGI would be better for movies like ThunderCats not this beautiful musical that they had to butcher.
it is like watching worst nightmare....
I only came here for the roast comments
Can you guys explain why you guys hate this film?
My pole dance song 🐱😻
I can&#39;t do this to myself
Here after red notice?
I’ve seen toilet flushs that are more interesting than this movie😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
Hi
Please never cook again
Just watched the movie.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Is this Disney&#39;s dark side?
This is scary
Am selling my cat
The Emoji Movie is looking better already. 😒
"Even Cats, No! Especially Cats! Would HATE this movie!"
Lovely
Help me I’m dying helppp
Who thought this was a good idea tho
Honestly I wonder how the actors felt when they saw the shitty reviews...
i rather watch the adventure of tintin that this creepy movie (the adventures of tintin visual effects are way better than this creepy movie)
I really didnt think it was so awfull haha people need to chill
"Idk why and I feel quilty, but I enjoyed the movie somehow, it was so bad, that it was good"
This may be the best movie for furries
Not enough teats. Real cats have teats
so basically &quot;furries: the movie&quot;
Para esto se presto taylor swift
This feels like Furry&#39;s Frankenstein
I haven’t watched this movie because I know I’d love it.
The cat equivalent of cancer
I feel like my ears and eyes are being raped by this movie
Who&#39;s idea was to make this  wtf?
WHO THINKS THE CATS ARE TERRIFYING
The emoji movie : finally a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary
Imagine if it was dogs😮
Watching cats right now on spectrum great broadway movie characters I really like this movie🍿🍿🍿🍿
I’m scared
Can’t even finish the trailer
Would it actually worked if they used cgi cats instead?
Chad kultchin brought me here now I have more questions? Wth is wrong with that man ?
Chad kultchin brought me here now I have more questions? Wth is wrong with that man ?
oh my eyes my eyes
Jennifer Hudson BUTCHERED what should have been the crown song of this play.
literally why
I loved the movie
is this real?
annaRichard love you
Wenn ich rumhacke... Das kann ganz schön fies werden aber gemein bin ich nicht... Man darf zurückmobben... Ne...
I take it most of the people who commented in the past have never seen or heard the original musical CATS by Andrew Lloyd Webber? Most of you have been overly judgmental to those who like it.. who cares if they like something diff than you? World would be a boring place if we all liked the same thing. Anyway I also take it you missed the core of the story which is basically being accepting of others for their appearance and differences in general. 🤦🏻‍♀️ seriously not sure how I missed that this came out in movie form though. I may not watch it as I prefer it on stage. The art form and dance is beautiful though.
A version with real cats would  of been better
"From now on, we just call it the C-word. The original title of this movie is offensive"
Yes the movie sucked. But the trailer actually looked great. I had no clue why y’all were fussing.
What the heck it’s that? Are those hecking cats? Hey stop showing me these those are weird cats.
"I just found out this happened oh my god and they lost ~ $114,000,000 usd ahhhhhhhhhhhh that&#39;s hilarious"
Congratulations on 40 anniversary Musical ! :)
what am i watching
The character design is so bad it even made Big Brother gag.
Can we just go back to tomes when we&#39;re just making fun of this movie? 😭 Life was simpler then.
Humans are so wierd
It&#39;s what really started the pandemic.
This just proves not everyone can sing broadway style. Taylor S and J Hudson butchered those songs
I saw the stage play in Nevada and New Mexico which I loved. Seeing the movie helped explain the stage play a lot more.  I personally like the movie quite a bit and really couldn&#39;t understand why others didn&#39;t.  I am not and never have been a huge musical fan but I do love CATS.
This is. What furrys dream about
"I actually love this movie. Unironically.<br><br>Tom Hooper&#39;s filmmaking career before this has been honestly fishing for Oscars as far as I&#39;m concerned. &quot;I made a movie about Royalty that humanizes them in a pre-WW2 setting!&quot; OSCAR! &quot;I made a movie of Les Miserables that takes all the emotion out of the music!&quot; OSCAR! This is the funhouse mirror version of those movies. It failed SO BADLY at being an Oscar bait movie that people are STILL commenting on it nearly half a decade later.<br><br>That said...I remember far more about this movie than The King&#39;s Speech or Les Miserables (the latter being an adaption of one of my favourite musicals - I&#39;ve never seen the OG Cats). It not only didn&#39;t bore me but it feels like David Lynch&#39;s Rabbits in that its a family sitcom thats not funny but also demands your attention in a way that you NEED to see it."
"You know the people who don&#39;t like this movie,most of them are just Weebs"
This film is what ruined 2020
supporters of the films are hella sus
This is an insult to CATs
And I thought furries were bad...
Aight ama go bleach my eyes anyone wants some to?
That was awesome!
Who here for taylor
I don’t want a cat any more..
<b>laughs</b>
And nothing of value was lost.<br>(Aside from an animation studio)
"Sometimes they continue to realse bad films due to the money they invested in it, they better make profit and  worst response than a loss at all"
I loved the movie! 10/10
movie was so bad that god sent a plague down a month later
All they needed was cat ears and they could’ve had the same shit result
There face are actually not a cat right
omg taylorrrrrrr
who let them cook bruh
I literally thought I was the only one that hated this movie XD
More dislikes than likes 😂
They look like they didnt try at all and just used snapchat filter
What song is this<br>Its kool
Is the movie rly that bad...?
"The world was bad enough, but it started going to absolute fucking shit when this travesty was released"
dangg alot of people dislike it xD<br>i thought they liked iit but yeah i wont do both
"AS A CAT LOVERS, WHAT THE F IS THIS OMG"
Like literally! 99% of the movie is just singing and dancing! And the last 1% is just your average movie!! LITERALLY  The beginning is cringe
Where is the dislike button?
Wait i just realized this was released on my bday 🌝
"Except for the pc animation, I think the actors were great performers, especially J. HUD. The story? Thats it, why should haven t they change?"
"Wait, this isn’t anime cat girl hentai 3D version"
Nice
How furries think they are:
My eyes hurt
my eyes
Keep in mind this is a furry movie
"lets be real ya&#39;ll, the only reason why this trailer has so many views is because everyone wanted to see how dogshit this entire thing will be; also to roast the shit out of it."
I’m glad that we can all agree that this movie is bad.
something fishy about the whole thing.
As a mask this is makes me wanting to be broken
I could probably make a better trailer on IMovie in like two days
No
@UniversalPictures. Dis U?

On second thought this movie is good after seeing the trailer for cuties which I hate
Taylor swift is in this movie
"not only was this the worst movie created, it also hurts the great actors reputations, and honestly ruins a once great play."
Is this satire ?

"I come out from under my rock… and this is what I’ve been missing..? Lmao… I  cannot stop laughing right now. That looks so fucking terrible, like a Saturday Night Live skit or something… and the fact that they made it look so serious… idk… this is just ridiculous lol"
"3 lines, the trailer and idea are both dumb."
"The movie is musical / fantasy not horror <br>Most people on this comment section have out this world views about this spectacular movie,, ,, this ain&#39;t horror it&#39;s actually a very fun and entertaining movie and simply another masterpiece and I really love that Taylor Swift is part of this movie ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"

So humans are cats so lazy
wtf is this
"You know what else sucked? The musical. The costumes were tacky and cheap looking, Grizabella&#39;s costume looked like a bunch of roadkill stitched together. Rum Tum Tugger looked like Frankenfurter turned into a cat. They all wore wrist and ankle warmers to make piss poor looking paws, and had immobile ears and tails. If you wanna talk about freaky looking, do ya&#39;ll remember the rumpus cat with the glowing eyes and leotard leaving <b>nothing</b> to the imagination? If you don&#39;t, here&#39;s a reminder <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYfLuoyxfMA"">https://youtu.be/QYfLuoyxfMA</a>  They had one crappy junkyard set to work with. There was no linear storyline and hardly a plot to speak of because it was just a bunch of people in bad cat costumes dancing around. However it got itself to 4th longest running Broadway musical of all time is a mystery because by all rights it should have crashed and burned just as hard as the movie because they&#39;re the same damn thing."
Goddamn Furry Pandemic of the 2000&#39;s
Yeah...mabye the sonic design wasn&#39;t so abd
Uncanny valley the movie
