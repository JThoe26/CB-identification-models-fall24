The guy that kept throwing pots at the woman who was walking away was a coward. He kept attacking her when her back was turned.  Then say how he would fight her if she was a man. She was walking and he kept chasing after her throwing hits when her back was turned.<br>Like don’t get me wrong she was defiantly in the wrong. But fighting someone with there back turned is so low
This lady is high as hell AKA~Skateboard WOMAN~😮
This mf zepto ads are so annoying

That poor kids skateboard. That was so sad. He wasnt even involved
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqhgG2ImHLE&amp;t=780"">13:00</a> that woman should not have to put up with that but she was ready to throw down even though she&#39;d probably lose she got guts and is tired of customers acting stupid."
"fastest way to make me leave a video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqhgG2ImHLE&amp;t=335"">5:35</a>. nobody likes watching the side of a room while listening ot the fight. dont put crap like that in videos, we leave over it."
Ur allowed to go to restaurants with a bad mood
A teacher should definitely be mature enough to walk away from the group of rowdy kids.
Was that woman arrested for having a gun and threatening to punch which she did hit first
"You snowflakes need to know when a person is a Karen or just voicing genuine concerns, like the woman in the Cinema is not a f&#39;in Karen, they damn well should have put age ratings on the poster!"
At least the last Karen admitted her lies
"the worker at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqhgG2ImHLE&amp;t=765"">12:45</a> talked to those customers like how i wanted to talk to my customers at wingstop when i was 18 lmao. i was assaulted multiple times, threatened, pushed, name-called, etc, etc. i was an easy target cuz i’m 5’4 n petite. there was a gym near the wingstop i worked at n those gym bros were the worst. they would puff out their chest n get in my face. i was a people pleaser until 2 months in when i got used to the job n knew everything. the amount of times i had to call up my dad bc sb spit in my face or threatened to fight me or made me feel uncomfortable when i was closing, was actually astonishing. my dad only had to threaten sb life once bc this guy was making inappropriate remarks to his friends in spanish abt me in front of my dad. he was basically saying that my dads a joke n he is going to “still” wait for me in the back parking lot insinuating that he’s going to SA me, pretty much. my dad knew exactly what he was saying n asked him what vehicle he drives. he told my dad like an idiot. went to the front, took a pic of his license plate, went back inside n told him, in spanish, that if he sees his vehicle in the back parking lot, he is going to kill him. he was not in the back parking lot when i got out 😅 n my dad waited til i got off n then followed me home. she stood on all ten, tho. u could tell she was rlly bout that n as she should. if ur threatening a woman, especially in fast food, expect some heat back. respect 🫡"
The kids wild

"Karen with the skateboards would have literally ate one if I was there, all her stuff including herself would have been in that damn water what the fuck"
The security guard one made me spit out my drink 🤣🤣🤣
Las Karens son las mujeres que aman y cuidan a los gatos. Por eso no las  confundan con esas humanas miserables del video.
Why does it always say get out of my face and you’re not even in their face and you’re all up in your space?
So like the jersey mikes one was intense….so much anger about a sandwich
Airplane Abbey was hilarious and the Flower pot patty shlda defended herself!!
On the second video why do this idiot even bother recording when he misses the fight please to all of you recording if you don’t have enough since to to keep the camera on what’s happening then don’t bother because it make you look incompetent makes you look like a moron someone they can’t just point and shoot the camera as easy as that someone they can’t speak and record at the same time someone can’t walk and chew gum at the same time please don’t record anything if you can do that just make yourself look like an idiot
Equal rights equal fights she would be wearing that skateboard
the most impressive moment was the last word of the video when she said &quot; yea&quot; and smiled.
😮
Stop censoring the video

Pushing, grabbing, stealing their shit, throwing a kids board away.<br>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been so pleased to see a woman being shamed with her face public knowledge.<br>Throwing the victim card after she assaulted many of them?!?!?"

La persona que siguió a los jóvenes está en serios problemas porque son menor de edad
"Wow es increíble como la violencia está en estas personas, todo tiene solución menos la muerte para estas personas que fueron a agredidas sin tener la culpa llamen a la policía para ellas porque si no lo hacen seguirán haciendo daño a otras y así ya tienen récord de ser agresivas o agresivos"
I hope the people in these food ones have been fired...

"Teresa Romansky, 35, was charged with one count each of disturbing the peace and wrongs to minors, according to Denver County Court records. She has a hearing scheduled on October 2, at which point she will enter a plea.  There is a very large chance she will get away clean.  Can you believe she pressed charges on the 11 year old (Charleston) for throwing her water bottle in the river after she threw his skateboard, which was instantly dropped."
"I hate people having their cameras out, but are filming the wrong way.."
"The woman who threw the skateboard is Teresa Romansky.  Police were called, they called the child&#39;s (Charleston Davidson) mother and the police mentioned the skateboard and not the physical attacks the woman caused.  Witnesses say she was intoxicated.   They are pursuing pressing charges now.  Not sure why the police didn&#39;t mention the assaults on minors to the mother.  People in Denver came together and got young Charleston new skateboards, shoes and other gear and even held a skateboarding event in his name."
Man that SMCCKKKK from the security 😊🤌🏻
Bro the second one was my favorite
Yo these people need Jesus.

"NEVER NEVER mess with people who prepare your food, you might get more than you asked for."
I am not sure KFC Karen could never be appeased. Some cultures say she is still roaming the US looking for someone to fill that appetite. Rawr!
What kind dugs they used?

Here we go again. Loonies calling ppl names. Stop with childish name calling oeople. All these people you are showing aren&#39;t named Karen.
Clickbait - watched 3 episodes and no Karen&#39;s were knocked out.
"The only reason I don’t like this stuff, yeah I do watch it, but I don’t like to; it’s because you don’t get to see the outcomes to see how it turned out. And by the way, there has been a rare shitty employee."
Trump 2024….Harris had four years…no legacy just more of the same if she gets elected.
Just play the damn videos and chill with the tts bullshit
"I had a neighbor who was a the biggest karen. I called her Condo Cop bc she acted like the police of our condo association and all our homes. She screamed at kids for walking through &quot;our property&quot;, told neighbors they were doing everything wrong, nitpicked anything that I or any nieghbor did to the windows or outsides of our houses. 2 neighbors who lived next to her moved out bc of her. She was such a horrible person to have as a neighbor. For 7 years I put up with her. Last year she died of cancer. And I keep thinking all that hate and anger is what did her in. And everyone is so relieved she&#39;s gone. How sad is that, to have people relieved that your dead."
"Nothing new,its old videos that you&#39;ve taken and are trying to pass it off as your own hard work !!!!!"
these clips are truly disturbing behavior. the white kid screaming at the black girl...omg...wearing a trump shirt too...omfg! If I witnessed that omg
how can we sit back and relax when ever single clip you want to reach in to the screen and slap someone around. good gwad that woman at the fast food place...no one should talk to anyone like she did.

The blonde in the green dress is clearly diluted.
The guy in the whiye truck clearly tried to hit the motorcyclist.
Shouldn&#39;t there a solid line going around the curve? I&#39;ve never seen dash lines in a curve before. That&#39;s stupid.

You know they show so many white people being racist but there&#39;s alot of bl*ck people that are racist too and for some reason they never show it. Imagine that <br>🤨🙄🫢
It’s insane how many people think they can assault/abuse people when they don’t get their way!

They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good. The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one. Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD. (Psalms 14:1-4)"
Coffee drive thru looks 100% staged
too much talk over
Someone must been the fashion police when they were in high school
why does this narrator talk so much
I like how Karen&#39;s always want their &quot;freedom of speech&quot; but don&#39;t want the responsibility that goes with that freedom!
we want to see the scene not hear your voice SOB!
Have you guys done a top 10 Florida Men?
Why are so many of these Karens lawyers or actually working in the legal field? Yikes 😬😬
"When I was growing up <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFBnvcDh4Ao&amp;t=304"">5:04</a> there was no leash law.

"I visited a Subway here in Indianapolis, if you want to learn the subways that are owned from foreigners, Consumers beware ? My son and I visited an establishment that was owned by foreigners we ordered are usually and I was shocked on the price thought it was a little pricey from my past visit to a subway just days previous, so the next day I went to another location owned by 100% American and my son and I ordered exactly the same meals but from a different Subway, the Price for the same meals was almost $8.00 difference…So I investigated the foreigners will charge for single items instead of combo and they know what they are doing . I reported the dishonesty to Subway head office and I found that the subway that was dishonest was in trouble for leaving out items on a meal but over charging for them stealing from you ..If a 12 inch sandwich is supposed to have 10 tomatoes on it they would put half if you did not catch them leaving product off that was on you , the Office explained that the Subway franchise I visited was famous for dishonest practices, and Subway incorporated fined and put them on warning . After this happening I’ve caught several other companies owned by foreigners doing this dishonest practice…Since I exploited the Subway of corruption they have sold it and walked away ..I shared this story so others can be aware of this fraud businesses owned from foreigners are committing ❤"
"Wow.............can&#39;t believe society still calls sick women Karen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,is there any sympathy for the good women who are named Karen, who now feel ashamed to say their names.................Man society is dumb, fix one problem to create another? There are hundreds of thousands of good women with the name Karen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
Lilly Gaddis isn&#39;t even a real TRAD WIFE! She&#39;s single and had a job?!?!?! She&#39;s just cosplaying as a trad wife! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
He said “like Thor” and I laughed so hard help 😭
Male Karen!? If it&#39;s a male he is just being a jerk.
americans  keeping the world amused
"So, do we have a &quot;Queen Karen&quot; yet? Any ideas? The agony of choice."
That Lilly&#39;s a disgusting mess. Her twitter feed is full of racist BS.
My beautiful niece is called Karen a more polite non confrontational person you could ever meet💖
You don&#39;t have to be white to be racist. Every race has its racists.
your likes are 1%  of views.   Because we are sick of fake woke BS.  Go back to suking dik.
7.30.  This lady was 100% in the right.   Only gay liberals who get a boner when they think they can invent racism and get away with it.
"racism sources:   whites, asians, latino: 5%     Blacks:  95%"
"My mom&#39;s hair dresser is named Karen and she is the nicest person, lol!!! A real, genuine person, for real, and it&#39;s sad that her name has become so negative!!!"

Why would you get mad about a free bus ride?
Voltaire - Common sense is not so common.
#10 I’m more considered more about why she has such ugly tattoos on her forehead
My dogs when walked are ALWAYS on the lead.<br>Yanks are pruds.
The fiest one - I am still wondering if she was charge for the hammer attack
Narration sucks.
"A British woman in the U.S. telling someone they perceive as Chinese, to go back to their own country.  Oh, the irony!"
EVERYONE is disgusted by Karens!  AKA Blue hiared Crazy Cat Ladies.
Not when they use their platform to attack people? While they use their platform to attack people. 🙄🤔
"Never say black women but when it&#39;s a white women, then we gonna let everybody know about that."
"First guy in Washington state, said they reported him to the police...really....?....YOU PHUCKING DEFUNDED THE POLICE ASSHATS"
"That barista is no victim, she assaulted him with a hammer, which is a deadly weapon. That is a retaliation, not a self defence. And while wants a coffee out if her hands😂 I mean look at her🤮🤢she was most likely also charged for this too."
I aint about to mess with someone dealing with my food!!! HELL NAW!!!!
There should have been a Karen&#39;s club based in America only lol 😂😂😂😅😅😅
"Sadly, she HAD to use the hammer for any measure of justice since what the customer did is all but legal in Seattle now"
Being a racist is stupid and a waste of time These people have issues and displayed a very bad performance
"You&#39;re a bunch of cowardly HYPOCRITES just TOO SCARED to showcase the subject with UNENDING material and that&#39;s the somehow acceptable, ENCOURAGED, and even CELEBRATED HYPOCRITICAL- Racism, HYPOCRITICAL-HATE SPEECH, and the ABSOLUTE HYPOCRITICAL-STEREOTYPING of WHITE PEOPLE ALONE!  I guess it&#39;s ALL good unless the victims aren&#39;t WHITE!!!  ONLY THEN is it a problem you PUKES!"
"How&#39;s come you HYPOCRITES NEVER show the REAL RACISM going on in this country unchecked, unidentified, unaddressed, uncondemned, and damned well UNPUNISHED?!?!?!?!  It is MOST DEFINITELY the ACTUAL epidemic in this country of HYPOCRITES, and it&#39;s the free-for-all RAMPANT-RACISM against WHITE PEOPLE, you HYPOCRITICAL-COWARDS!!!!!"
"Good God! I wouldn&#39;t want anything served to me by a freak show, shit show like that either."
"The bikini coffee stand guy was in the wrong, but so was she for smashing his window. How is that considered self defense?"
"You didn’t show the subway takedown. And, I believe you need a new job."
Less commentary and more footage please
Karen-ness. lol
Not your best work Mojo
The video footage is minimal to non existent. Mostly A.I. commentary.
"Nature has a way of warning you not to F around, Wasp w sting-yellow, Poisonous Death Frog-orange, Bad Ass Barista with Hammer - tattoos on face.  #2 murder weapon of choice behind guns."
Are you going to show any of these incidents or just tell stories??
Why can’t people understand that freedom of speech does not mean you are also free from the repercussions of that freedom.
Give the dude a gift card .... Anytime you come in bullshit
Trad wife?? Shes not even married 🤣🤣
What slur did the trad wife use?
imagine freaking out cause you CAN&#39;T pay the 1.00!  huh?
Damaging someones property is not an appropriate reaction to making a mess.
"lousy video. all talk, no action."
I think the MAGA cult has destroyed society as we know it.  Anger and harassement are their ways of doig things in the age of the OrangeAnus.
MALE KAREN?  You su¢k. Especially your stupid narration
"Social media and most importantly their creators have decided to use the name “Karen” as an euphemism for the four letter “C***” word; although with two syllables Karen said fast can easily be heard as having one syllable and with the hard “K” and the hard “C” sound  these two similarities make the misogynists feel no shame in demeaning women this way; it’s PATHETIC that as a society we let our Late Loved Ones and our Living Grandmothers, Mothers,  Daughters and Sisters named Karen be abused in this way. Hey, the sheep must like this with all the thumbs up, with so many views and comments; lead them to the slaughter with hatred toward women upon their minds."
"Anyone else think the coffee thing was kinda &#39;eeeeeeh...&#39; Like if it had shattered or he drove off when she was still hanging onto the hammer, one or both could have been much more hurt. And either way guy could have easily sued n prossibly won. &#39;He threw some cold coffee at you so you attacked him with a hammer?&#39;"
Woah.
"It might have gotten worse with GOVERNMENT JABS!!!!!!!!  My brother retired military, always told me &quot; NEVER TRUST THE GOVERNMENT &quot;"
Reminds me of when I worked at a pet store and as we were closing up one night a dude came in (right as I went to go lock the door) we told him the store was closed and h proceeded to argue with us. 🙄
It always amazes me how willing people are to risk public shame and jail over mediocre at best fast food
"I love how they say this negative thing seems to happen in conservative circles but if I point out the progressive Trans people that have been found trying to groom and assault children that have been arrested and say that seem to happen in those circles, well now I&#39;m the asshole lol"
"So coffee thrown at a window = hammer? No, that one is messed up. That is not a matching of force. Fluid that had no risk of causing injury and didn&#39;t even make it in the store does not justify using DEADLY FORCE (hammers can kill) on a person&#39;s vehicle. Concerned for your safety? Yea right. I&#39;m concerned for anyone that knows you when you respond to anything with a fricking hammer. He is initially at fault but that went well past the appropriate response. Remind me to take out my firearm if someone spits on me, cause apparently thats ok."
Funny the Americans came here to California! In 1849😂😂 and they tried to bring slaves to California then californios told them we work for our own we don’t need slaves!😂
No body shouldn&#39;t look at your video why did you record it if you don&#39;t want any body to see it.
There is no need to show it if you going to mess the picture up.
I unsubscibed because of the wavy effect used to censor the fights. People wanna see fights. Not hear dumb narrating and deal with youtubes ever tightening censorship.
You need to find yourself another job because you’re waving the best part is stupid stupid stupid
If you gonna wave it wavy wavy wavy wavy your fights don’t bother posting anything else cause you’re wasting everybody’s time
"Bill Maher said it best, “When the media shows clips about racist Karen’s getting karma, they NEVER show black racists that get their asses checked. It’s only White, Asian, or Hispanic racists that get coverage, yet FBI crime stats indicate that black on White racist attacks are three times more than the other way around. That’s because the truth doesn’t fit their narrative.” He’s ABSOLUTELY right."
For the little girl in the shop that&#39;s crying you know they have ads on YouTube where you can make $180 an hour by being an actress but your act need some improving and that&#39;s my opinion like it or not really don&#39;t care but you have a good day anyway
Victoria’s Secret Karen should have been locked up.  In another video with more info cops just let her go and gave this woman a hard time.  Incredible.
These videos claim that Karen’s get knocked out cold when no such thing EVER happens and they blur the videos.  WASTE OF TIME!!!  Nothing but liars!!
"This channel has to be run by AI, look at the robotic responses when people call out the clickbait title 🤔"

For all of you moaning about blurs YT would shut this channel down otherwise 🙄🤦‍♂️
Those are some real sick ducks to encourage a fight with 2 year old crying and all they care about is hair pulling disgusting they done deserve kids 😮
"White people are trying to make KAREN a term that can define any woman! Wrong! Don’t even try it, it’s not gonna happen! KAREN is a slang term for a WHITE WOMAN perceived as entitled or demanding beyond the scope of what is normal. The term is often portrayed in memes depicting WHITE WOMEN who use their white privilege to demand their own way. Depictions include demanding to &quot;speak to the manager&quot;, being racist, or wearing a particular bob cut hairstyle. NO, THEY DON’T COME IN ALL RACES!"
Why would you confront someone with your child in your arms.
"Woman knows what she&#39;s doing. She got quiet when the doors opened, but started in again when doors shut."
Did she take the sandwich and want her money back?
"Politics is not a reason to lose a friendship. But then again if you can&#39;t accept each other, you&#39;re not friends. <br>Get the children away."
"Protect me, please. But not because of my behavior."
I would never put my guy into any a@$ whooping situation.

Blue needs some exercise not chicken

"It is the rare black that can speak English, it’s pure garbage"
"That woman on bus/train can’t speak,."
"Karens need to wear better outfits, if they are going to cause A disturbance."
Why are the trouble makers mainly black
Dont watch big karma videos..they blur shit out
All old videos !!   Go to another channel
Women need to learn to keep their hands off of men🎉

It’s always heartbreaking when you hear a child screaming in the background because 2 people he probably knows are fighting with each other one is probably mum !!
Why change the way it records
Bruh let me see the f*cking vedion Jesus Christ😡🤬
Inside Mac Donald’s food there’s something make you throw garbage around compulsively

"Fuck your channel, why don&#39;t you show us everything thats noncence video only bla bla....we want to see full show"
Blurred it out
Karens are specifically entitled ignorant whyte woman. That&#39;s why the name Karen. These are mostly like Rashidas or Taniqas.

Video is titled wrong. Bogus. False adversising BS. ... Reported
Morons!!! Why even share the video when you’re blurring it out !
"bullshit, dont waste your time"
Don&#39;t post anymore 😑 lol
Rotten video. The producer blurs out fight scenes as if the audience is juvenile and not mature enough to view them.
SUCKS
This wavy shit is annoying
You should put a trigger warning for the wavy effects on the video for people who have disabilities. That video trigger my  headaches and anxiety .
People need to band from stores and reaturant the way there act 😊
Seen the word &quot;racist&quot; well kid I cried a river...then hit &quot;do not recomend channel&quot;
That horse casually trotting up to him while he is running for his life. Hilarious

I apologize for saying ‘Aurora.’ Brain glitch.
More nominees for The Karen Awards!
The COVID-19 Karen was in denial and needed to be banned from the store!
The Irish dude didn&#39;t have any luck that evening once arrested...
"The second video took place at a fast food restaurant, not at a post office."
"Covid or no, if you cough on me like that, it&#39;s night night time"

Liar
"Scott Adams , right....again"

Sit down and relax? hahahah
Hate the &#39;click bait&#39; ... 6 videos in... NOBODY GOT KNOCKED OUT.... BYE...
Did you call African-Americans immigrants? if that&#39;s the case you would have to apply that then to everybody here in America.
&quot;not the old man. Oh Lord&quot; lol!!
Wait....is that Kayla??? 25.57 minutes in.
There’s a pretty consistent theme of women hitting men and not expecting to get hit back. You shouldn’t expect not to be hit!

"Love that everyone is recording yet they can&#39;t call 911, &#39;merica!"
America. It’s full of sheeeeet
Stop blurring out the good parts 😡
I don’t understand why images are being censored
I hate it when ignorant people say that the police don’t need three people for one person- yes they do and it’s done to protect the person being arrested and the police officers involved in the arrest why should they go one on one? I bet if they did that wouldn’t be right either. Don’t pass judgement until you’ve walked in someone else’s shoes
Could do without the music playing over the talking
"People, the video only helps you when the cops are wrong; otherwise, you record evidence of your wrongdoing for the judge."
Many have not learned anything from history that blacks are no longer second class people
Gluttony is a sin Dunkin’ donuts 🍩 woman
You get it right the first time and pull not push the door
I’m English and I thought USPS stood for the United States Postal Service so why are they serving food there ? Or is it that someone has ballsed up the narration for this clip?
That was a great idea too sentence the Karen who threw food at a chipotle employee to work there for a month I hope she gets an understanding of how much work it is for little pay and no reward
At 12.22 how is he a Karen and there was no nee for the office to hit the man. head sould read instant Karma and Karen

"Im a white Brit , and one thing above all on many of these clips is the willingness for many white Americans to be out and out racist right off the Bat , personally it&#39;s shocking to me and bothers me a lot . America really is a racist country which barely even tries to hide it ."
"The Karen @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIlRyerP-U&amp;t=220"">3:40</a>, I screamed! Lady karma is a beautiful b*tch 😂😂😂"
Why the one third width videos?
why do you have to blur  the fight scenes?
Du 16/9pour les faux!
Did I click on the wrong video??? This isn’t Karen karma this is Karen’s doing whatever they want and walking away without consequences!!!! The fuck?
So far I don’t see no karma only Karens walking away Scott free
"2nd vid, workers were trying to steal her money."
"okay, first video, who is who? is the customer the violator or is it now she behind the counter enduring the wrath of yet another Karen?"
Maybe next video make the screen more small
And the stupid continues and these kind are in government. 😮
Im reayin disbelief how childish whyte people are
The dog park one cmon bruh dogs are like that it is in the nature it wasn&#39;t aggressive so shut up my dudes. The racist crap yes is bad but being Hispanic and dealing with it I still believe in the freedom of speech  words only have power if you let them .
And moral is if ur going throw dog poop at a cop make your is a German shepherd  not a pug.
"I like how there is no one who got knocked out cold, instead they just keep talking and yapping, stop clickbating lil bro."
"The customer is NOT always right, Blondie! Order it right the first time and be patient 😊"
"The nit wit whose dog is off leash and who pays taxes, she feels she is entitled to. What an idiot"
Erm…what the sigma?
Damn! The way i love ur videos 😭🤣🤣🔥i came here running when i saw the notification!
Why are you blurring videos? The whole point of a video is to be watched. Disliked and skipped.
That poor old mall cop. At least he tried right.
Blacks are racist. I noticed...<br>Why angry around where the food is...

"That piece of work screaming in the restaurant about how her kids don’t eat green things, they eat red things, should’ve taken a moment to listen to herself say that and maybe she’d hear how ridiculous it sounds to everyone else. She’s lucky I wasn’t in the store. I never let people yell at employees without stepping in to bark back at them. I CANT STAND BULLIES! We should ALL help each other out as much as we can. We need to come together to fix this world we’ve broken."

"Ada indikasi zelensky menyelewengkan atau menikmati berbagai bantuan militer bersama-sama dengan biden untuk kepentingan pribadi mereka dengan mengorbankan rakyat dan tentara ukraina. Hal ini dapat dilihat dari  banyaknya bantuan militer yang dikerahkan keukraina yang pada akhirnya tidak menghasilkan apapun. Mereka hanya bisa memperlambat tentara rusia, namun tidak pernah ada hasil yang memuaskan bagi ukraina. olehnya itu kita semua patut menduga bahwa bantuan tersebut hanya sebagian yang sampai di Ukraina. Selain itu terlihat pula dari tingginya upaya teror dan penembakan terhadap lawan politiknya. Mungkinkah mereka takut diaudit...???"
"37 and change, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23presidentbiden"">#PresidentBiden</a> said “You wanna start a nuclear war, go ahead.” That is not what I want Mr.President…<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23thankyou"">#thankyou</a> for bowing out now!"
"Ok! In the second response, President Trump promised to end the war between the election and inauguration…DO IT NOW!!! HAVE MELANIA CALL THEM!"

This is an argument

Took a shot every time Joe Biden says &quot;and the idea&quot;
FAKE NEWS MSNBC said Crazy Joe won. 😊😂😂😂
Biden is old and becoming senile but he is so much smarter and responding to questions better than Kamala. At least he still know what he is talking about. 😂

Thou shall not kill babies in certain stages
Donald Trump is right Biden &amp; Kamala are allowing in millions of immigrants are going to wipe out social security paying for all these  immigrants making crime rate through the roof no thank you Biden for destroying our country

"Let&#39;s appreciate the oldest man, Biden. 💚"

Это не свобода. <br>Это подчинение чужой воле.<br>Цветные революции в ряде стран постсоветского пространства устроенные США и их союзниками привели к нестабильности и разрушениям многих стран. Привели к разрушению мира и благополучия в этих странах, а так же к войнам, где погибли сотни тысяч человек. <br><br>Демократия дискредитировала себя созданием междоусобных прокси войн, свержением неугодных правительств, созданием религиозных расколов и религиозных войн среди христиан и мусульман, растлением нравственности и распространением идеологии гомосексуализма. Кроме того, конфликт Украины с Россией грозит перерасти в ядерную мировую войну.<br>Идёт поддержка демократами из ЕС, США, Англии с помощью оружия воюющей с Россией Украины. Именно демократы поджигают войну, которая не может закончиться из за их адского стремления наказать Россию и поделить её природные ресурсы. Из за зависти к России и ее богатству правителей европейских стран с США идёт сейчас война. Льется кровь невинных мирных людей. <br>Убивают десятки тысяч военных из за алчности политиков США, Англии, Германии, Франции, Италии, Польши, Румынии и т д.<br> Мир поставлен на колени благодаря кланам демократов, придумавших все эти безумные идеи, чтобы взять весь мир в свое единоличное правление. <br>Этому надо положить конец!<br><br>Даже если Россия победит, западные страны и США не смогут исправить свой фашистский звериный образ.  Нужно реабилитироваться. Не только в глазах всего мира, но и сменить ущербный курс приведший человечество к большим жертвам. <br>Демократия должна быть низложена и взят новый принцип на созидание мира во всем мире. <br>О мире перестали говорить, как будто ракеты не могу разрушить густонаселённых страны Европы и переполненные людьми города Америки. Это безумие!!! Демократы заигрались с огнём!<br>В США демократов лучше сменить на республиканцев, таким образом можно запустить освобождение от демократии во всем мире и поменять образ фашизма на реальную свободу для народов от диктатуры демократов. <br>Мир даст новые рабочие места, поднятие экономик стран, улучшение качества жизни людей и самое главное перемены в нравственности и образе жизни людей.<br>Мир должен стать  чище и лучше, без звериной сути демократической утопии обманувшей всё человечество. <br><br><br>What to do to bring peace.

where is the comment bout covid he skibided with
Debate be like :<br>Biden : 😦😴<br>Trump : 😏
I love when Trump looks over to Biden when he starts not making any sense and can’t put words together 😂😂😂😂
"Putting everything else aside, the golf tangent was crazy😂"
"That there are people out there that seriously supported Biden, no matter how dement he was, just shows us the state the western world is in. Litarelly erasing itself."

Vance clearly won the debate even though the garbage moderators were biased and wouldn&#39;t follow the rules.  Kudos to Vance for fact-checking the leftist media.  The Republicans should not agree to another debate with CBS or ABC due to the blatant bias.

What are &quot;Black Jobs &quot;?&quot;  Trump has refused to answer what he would do for childcare.  He also didn&#39;t answer the childcare question in his debate with Kamala.
"In two debates, I notice Trump refuses to answer how he is going to deport all the immigrants.  He changes the subject and goes on a rant."
I&#39;m a veteran. Total of about 5 years&#39; worth of combat. I have no help from the VA
"Two months later I finally watched this.<br><br>-It&#39;s so much easier to concentrate on what the candidates are saying when there&#39;s no distracting applause, cheering and jeering from an audience. In studio is a good format.<br><br>-If Biden (who was clearly nervous) had slowed down a bit, he might not have his lost of train of thought as he so embarrassingly did. His facial expression in the beginning even looked like that of a person who was tired and ill. However, his performance (and even the look on his face) did improve over the course of the debate. All in all, not bad for an 81 year old with a speech impediment, but he still made the right decision in no longer resisting the call to step aside. It was time.<br><br>- Trump just looking into the camera does work for him. He also proved he can resist taking the bait and no longer just blathers away even during an opponent&#39;s time. The annoying sniffing appears to be gone, too. Experience seems to have been a good teacher as this was not a bad performance. Still, Trump&#39;s assertion that the environment was well looked after during his administration is laughable, he doesn&#39;t say how he would negotiate a deal between Russia &amp; Ukraine, his addressing of the subject of The Proud Boys continues to be weak, as was his response regarding the January 6th riot.<br><br>In summation: Biden made the right move stepping aside, and Trump should&#39;ve done the same thing. No matter what their records indicate, these guys are both too old. <br>Next time let&#39;s see a match up between people who aren&#39;t past their prime."
Why does everyone call trump president???!<br>He’s NOT
"In short:<br>Trump: You are sucks<br>Biden: No, you are sucks"

"I follow the predisential debate between Harris and Trump and see confirmation that it doesn&#39;t matter who the next POTUS is. They both grovel to the Israeli lobby. The only difference is that Harris is indeed dumber than Trump but has a more sympathetic face than Trump. And that will be the deciding factor for the US voters. As a Dutchman, I am only interested in the fact that the US is on the decline. And that is good for the world."

Trump is on point.  I know he won the election in 2020 but the Democrats DID NOT allow it.  They forgot to cheat in 2016 because they underestimated us and were overly confident in Hillary.  They will not let him win in 2024.
This was GREAT!! Trump looked so good. He performed well. <br>The upcoming debate when Trump will win be Harris will end up the same.
😢
lol
This CNN is siding with Biden
Biden can’t speak well ! He is eating the words
Biden like a robot
"It’s still legal to have plan B pill so no excuse for needing abortion these days , it should be last resort no used for contraception"
"God he looks old and ill, them silly faces he pulls are unprofessional, trump’s right the world is laughing at America and it’s Bidens fault. What about poor white people why don’t they get help to buy homes or free student loans it’s not fair and it causes racism"
More people died of Covid under Biden then Trump  look it up.

"Would you like to know why everything has tripled in our country because they need the money for the immigrants they already spent $150 million buying them homes giving them credit cards feeding them putting them in five star apartments and hotels it’s all swept under the carpet so we need to put the best president in the world which is Donald Trump back in the White House we must vote and make America great again and keep him him and his family in your prayers daily vote. Vote vote for USA. Let’s make it great again he deserves the keys to the White House after the votes were rigged, which we need to pray this doesn’t happen ever again, they crooked the Democrats are possible that’s why they’re hiding in the seller at the White House how to do evil and cheat cheat and lie lie lie that’s why they don’t want the debate to go on open borders open prison cells dying in our country I mean, what’s 911 they’ll be putting rockets in our High tower buildings all over the country. If you don’t get Harris out of the White House, our country will be destroyed. It already is, but it will be worse than you can ever imagine. It’s important to vote. Vote vote for the best president in this country Mr. Donald Trump I’m proud of him. I love him. I love our country.

Number 1: Debate Bots.
That’s past history so DROP IT!
Bidens son is a druggie
"The greatest economy?? Yea the greatest economy that was handed to him by Obama/ Biden ! And what did he do with it!?! Trump runs it into the ground!. instead of protecting the  American economy Trump rolls the dice on the American way of making a living and looses big time!! With absolutely no idea of what he&#39;s doing, and will not let the professionals or Scientists guide him, Trump allows America shipwreck!! No More!!"
Crooked sleepy Joe biden always say no.1 no.2 no.3 talk no action
Absolutely Donald j trump win next president. But Joe Biden lost Joe sleep in bed go home and stay at home.

President HARRİS🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
This was better than the Trump/Harris debate
"The two biggest lies she told — and it was difficult to choose because she said so many — are the one where she said police had been killed on January 6 and the “fine people” lie in Charlottesville. Both lies are demonstrably false. The fine people lie, which has been discredited for years and is documented on video, has also been thoroughly debunked by liberal Snopes."
"Biden actually talked good points on the Nato argument. he just sounds so weak and timid, kinda sad. cause I appreciate him greatly"
Biden must to retire. Him voice is so tired 😢😢😢
Geriatrics debate!
😂😂😂

Did we seriously watch an argument about golf for the last part of this debate
Trump
tRump who&#39;s the old one now ? Harris/Walz 🎉🎉🎉
How about Americans being homeless
Americans have always helped themselves if we got our jobs back we could help ourselves again
Talk about golf and being convicted and still nothing about American questions like jobs or anything other than healthcare
I was worried biden the burden was going to have a heart attack😂
This two.😂 Guys they don&#39;t look like they have debate 😂....
The Greatest debate of all time.😂😂 We finally beat Medicare. It was a long conflict against Medicare.😂

"About the age concern, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s happening to Biden. Biden has his own health problems. I&#39;ve seen guys older than him with very sharp minds. This guy us sick. Please let him go rest in peace."

I think they are secretly bffs
This videos cuts out a pretty big part that points out just how much of a joke Biden&#39;s voters were for picking him.
Very good chat
Who Biden

Look if We could only stop Medicare what? Did he really say that!! (Biden ) Mind-blowing
"i feel like bidenomics, will make reaganomics look like a joke. when we look back at this."
They should duel on Yu-Gi-Oh Master Duel
I feel bad for Biden
"Tru,p won this debate. Hope he can beat Kamala on September 10, and let Trump be our president in 2024 👍🏿"
Let the trumph win next time
up
The media are doing their best to make people forget this debate and who Trump was debating.
Arguing about golf like bros
Took me 55 seconds to laugh
Lol
"You leave off the best line.  One second later, Biden says, “You’re a child”."
fckinu reterda - the whole thing!
"American manufacturers of a number of expensive cars are obliged to stop selling cars to other countries due to the unregulated issuance of loans to people falsifying their income, thus, given further circumstances, it is more profitable to improve the economic reserve, overcrowded prisons and anti-ecology do not suit anyone, this should not have been the case."
"And sleepy joe does it again! Starts off strong, fast, good volume and just comes to a complete stop in the middle of a sentence and forget where he is. That’s some serious skills bro!<br>I remember watching him read off the teleprompter and he’ll say a line and on the screen he’s reading says repeat the line he’ll actually say repeat the line during the sentence. Poor guy."

What I think it does not matter who is president we all need to come together as a team and work this out trump you do not deserve to be president yet Biden you’re Getting old you’re not gonna be president forever ok Biden is older than trump so he knows more than him ok if trump will stop causing problems we will be able to love on one another again and we will be able to come together as a community and make things right we out here killing each other left to right be each other friends go to church and get prayer God says come as you are don’t let the devil steal you’re joy God has all of us danld trump is trying to destroy nato that’s very important to us trump has not earned to be president again until he is capable to learn how to not lie and just tell the truth stop doing bad things we all make mistakes but this is something else hey everybody let’s come together let god handle all bad things the devil is trying to destroy us let god use you and be better all of us come together as a community and not fight not kill each other not hurting one another let’s be friends and get along life is to short I love everyone in this world wit my whole heart but we can’t do this come together love you all and God bless America

i’m tempted to commit tax evasion.
I did not watch the debate  every bill  under him took the country backwards.
"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE bring on the Trump v Kamala debate. Dont deny us that treat.....it will be HILARIOUS. 🤣"
Why did you all let him come out like that? 😮

The american citizen should take to streets come out for gathering demostrations without peaceful no mercy against current president which is really old enough not qualify for seats order require for the president to resigns step down immediately after watching these
"Read analysis from the debate here: <a href=""https://on.wsj.com/47MyDkF"">https://on.wsj.com/47MyDkF</a>"
Senator Vance did so well.👏 Bravo.
These Walz lies are so deep
Finland&#39;s teachers are some of the best paid in the world.
"Why does walz look like a physcopath everytime he talks? It just makes me feel uneasy every single time, its strange or i guess i should say &quot;weird&quot; lol"
Great debate! I think these two gentlemen should be running for President. They would make a formidable team.
Can Vance run for president next time?
Does he know anything else besides Minnesota?  That&#39;s all I hear -
finally a successful debate based on arguments and not nonsense. congratulations to both candidates
"I think Vance dispelled a lot of the negativity that the opposition has drummed up in regard to his ability. He was incredibly well spoken, reasonable &amp; respectful. Great job."
"Still a 3 v 1, gotta love it"
"That&#39;s right, Harris already has an opportunity to make changes,  but didn&#39;t."
"Are you people insane? What was civil about JD Vance? He kept lying till the end. Its a disgrace. He supports a radikal, that wants to steal our freedom. He knows how to sound moderate, but he is not! Dont get distracted!"
"Tim,, how do you quote the bible then later on support killing Gods children? You know whom else quoted scripture to try to corrupt it? satan"
"Even if we build more houses, what&#39;s to stop the rich from buying them up too and continuing to treat property like a commodity?"
"Kamala lied when she said biden was fit for office, bidenomics works the borders are secure and when a judge ordered her to hand over excupatory evidence to defendants. <br><br>Waltz lied about his military record and affinity for China"
"Trump put the cap on insulin at $35, stop taking credit for what yoy didn&#39;t do. Thank you though, it shows  you agreed with Trump without coming out and saying it."
"Wall Street Journal is corrupt and evil.  Shame on these &quot;journalists&quot; for their evil deeds.  They push leftist evil agenda.  The Holy Lord God Almighty Jesus Christ is the truth and the truth shall set you free.  The wages of sin is death.  Lying is sin and pushing evil agenda,  not being fair and unbiased is evil.  Shame on the Wall Street Journal top management and all those whom took part."
"Im glad that the vice presidents seem a bit more tame than their running mates. Kamala, the infinite slogan repeater with a horrible track record, versus Donald Trump, the low key kinda crazy guy, but he&#39;s got good ideas, fights and just makes things work with a great track record. In no world am i voting for kamala, but if it would be waltz, it would atleast be a closer battle. In all honesty, both of the vice presidents seem like a better choice than their presidential counterparts 😂"
I&#39;m impressed with JD Vance and to be fair Tim was OK. Definitely better than Kamala.
Vance is 10 times the man Walz could ever hope to be. His whole family isn&#39;t even voting for him and kamala.
I trust a man with a shadow more than one without.
Serious YouTube? Four commercials every 10 minutes? You’re digging your own grave
Vance did an amazing job 🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🪠🪠
America can&#39;t afford four more years of Harris
It’s impossible to claim there is “no widespread voter fraud” when we aren’t requiring ID or any other certification to vote. You can’t prove or disprove something when you aren’t gathering the information required to do so<br><br>Lack of proof does not prove nor disprove anything. You need proof to either prove or disprove
Harris wants middle class taxpayers to pay for health care and housing for unvetted migrants.<br><br>NYC already paid 5.5 billion on unvetted migrants
Yall notice how much they cut off Vance but always let wahlz finish his statement. So bias
It really comes down to who would you want to be your president in 4 years.
"Blaming inflation, housing, and everything under the sun on immigrants is infuriating when it&#39;s so obviously corporate greed at the root of those issues. <br><br>Housing isn&#39;t up because of immigration. It&#39;s up because it&#39;s viewed as an investment and as a result, corporations own the majority of US residential housing."
"Vance is future, listen to him"
"Illegal immigrants with no social security # are getting mortgages to buy $300,000+ houses.  Mmmhmmmm."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbKF3Qt9hg&amp;t=737"">12:17</a>"
Waltz so disgusting
This blind trust in so-called science is only possible because the population is so dumbed down they don&#39;t know that the &quot;science&quot; is paid by the government. That is like if you paid someone to say exactly what you want.
"Some bills are not paseed because of what is hidden in them. These laws need to be thoroughly looked at before looking at. Remember obama care, that was a mess. Nancy we won&#39;t know what&#39;s in it until we pass it, nonsense. Not how it works.😊"
We need Trump in office!
"Climate scientists are not scientist. If the existence of a job depends on a crisis being real, then you can&#39;t trust the guy who says there is a crisis. He will lose his job if there is no crisis."
The Best Debate Ever 🙌🏼  <br>Im Voting Republican  .
Vance has credited eyes.
"Ohh Vance is an opportunist, he wants VP, so he can be given Presidency. Ohh I can see it."
This debate was far better than Kamala and trump ; this actually are true politicians 2 diplomats statistical dudes really explaining what they are going to do for the country ! 😂😂 trump vs Kamala was more like children debate not even ……. I like both but I’ll vote for vence 🎉 this was more like a presidential debate !!
"Minnesota is one of the most child friendly states and Minnesota has an epidemic of children getting guns and shooting themselves? Of course, this from someone who says he has befriended school shooters."
Where is the help for young widows/widower and single parents with young kids. They can’t find jobs to work with them on getting a good balanced work schedule. It’s either you come in 6:00am or earlier in morning or you work nights. Where is the 9:00am to 5:00pm jobs that pays decent wage for these parents for they can work and take care of their families with one income?
"Wow, how refreshing!"
Just like they did to trump cut the mic  one sided
"Vance did a really, really great job. I can&#39;t believe anyone wouldn&#39;t vote for him after this."
"The notion that extreme weather is linked to warming is so absurd, it is quite baffling that anyone believes it. It shows how scientifically illiterate people are."
I love Vance!
Walz looks like his in amphetamine &quot;Vance Shread him to peaces &quot;
Can we please get a second presidential debate on CBS instead of MSNBC? This is how a debate is supposed to be conducted fair and tough questions for both candidates. Get Trump and Kamala on here and I think the country will be able to make a better decision. If CBS host a presidential debate.
"Ha ha ha, Vance won easily even in a 3vs1 situation. This man will inherit MAGA from Trump in 2028."
Why do the democrats consistently lie?
The moderators suck as usual!
Rainfall and hurricanes is a sign of global cooling. Any physicist knows that warming increases entropy and thereby minimizes temperature differences and therefore also the occurrence of tornados and hurricanes.
Amazing how all the commercials during this debate all bash Trump. Really necessary? Couldn’t have random product commercials? Oh wait- Merrill Lynch had a few and we know they are totally LEFT leaning. Otherwise great debate with the exception of cutting off Vance or using the - “We have a lot to cover” excuse.
Abortion is not healthcare.
Be a Kennedy Democrat- vote Trump!
Senator Vance - Donald Trump was willing to have his own vice president attacked by mob violence when the vice president refused to break his oath of office. What steps would you take to ensure your safety if your sworn constitutional duty conflicts with the president&#39;s whims?
"See how at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbKF3Qt9hg&amp;t=1830"">30:30</a> these two propagandists Commie true red color comes out. This is why this media is all fake media.  Is American Pravda. Zero credibility."
"Very civil debate, the President&#39;s themselves can learn a great deal from these two men in how to handle a debate. JD Vance has won this Debate, hands down. Trump will win this!  Election.  Vance will step in and take his place in the future. I hope alongside Vivek Ramaswamy. They would be an incredible team in the future to secure America&#39;s Strength."
Vance says the Cartel is using children as drug mules and one of the moderators tries to make it seem like he was accusing Kamala of using children as mules. Then she says nothing when corrected.
Conservatives are avoiding any question about Jan 6th like the PLAGUE.
"An excellent debate that has set a benchmark for future Presidential and VP debates. The sustained focus on issues, healthy acknowledgement of validity in the opponent&#39;s points, clear and meaningful attempt to respond to questions made it a very good debate. Both VP aspirants batted solidly and articulated the policies and positions of their respective captains much better than Harris or Trump could. Kudos to both Vance and Walz for that! While Vance showed a clear edge with his astute knowledge and oratory, Walz was on the back foot as his teammate is a cackling hyena and some of their policies are rather indefensible. Yet another positive was both moderators were mostly professional, unlike in the Presidential debate where Trump was debate a team of three!"
"Interesting how much happier people are when we only have one party. Two politicians who&#39;s interests align exactly for the political class and everyone is so happy about them being civil with each other. We should just stop having elections and let politicians decide who is in charge, by the youtube comments you&#39;d think that would make everyone a lot happier if they never had to confront anyone or work towards their own interests haha."
"Dear Americans. So many comments appreciating that these two had a &#39;normal&#39; debate. <br>I bet you could have had the same experience, if Vance would have debated Harris. <br>Now take a moment and think about it, WHO makes the debates and the presidential elections a clown show. <br>Anyway. Not my monkeys, Not my business. Wish you good luck !"
"I just hate when they say things  like Kamala has had 3.5 years to do what she wants. Actually Biden is president not Kamala. She doesn’t have the powers to do squat. Donald has already been president and had the opportunity and screwed up everything. Mike Pence was the biggest patsy because Vice president can’t override the president. She works for Joe Biden 😅 Hopefully she gets a chance to win, so she can show and prove herself."
Warning: There are a bunch of crypto bots in the comments spamming about XAI8-something which instantly all received 1k upvotes.
Walz has that Betamale high-pitch voice at the end of each sentence.<br>JD Vance has the voice of a real marine.
Sorry Vance but there no such thing as a “state viewpoint”.
Trump/Vance  2024 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Both of these gentlemen behaved and presented themselves well<br><br>The VP should be working to elevate the Pres, I felt Vance did a better job of reinforcing the policies of Trump where Walz focus more on attacking Trump instead of elevating Harris"
Who else hates Hyundai after this debate?
Someone should have gotten these guys a room. 😂 cosied up to each other much
April 2024 there was the most recent school shooting in Finland .

It&#39;s not HER administration; she&#39;s not in charge. How much autonomy does he think Trump is going to give him if elected?
Why are the moderators making their own points after the candidates are done making theirs?
"unbiased opinion from someone with no skin in the game; Vance&#39;s Yale experience was on show last night - he is a skilled debater.  I still feel we don&#39;t know the real Vance. he definitely holds conservative values but I genuinely don&#39;t believe him to be as extreme and evangelical as many of his colleagues including Mr Trump.  I am from a country where for too long the church and state were too closely connected and this has had dire consequences for the women and children of my country which are still being uncovered today; I fundamentally believe religion and religious beliefs are personal and should not be used to develop policy and laws - on both sides! I think Tim Walz is genuine, solid and a fundamentally a good person, not as articulate and sleek a debater as Vance but he stepped up and did a great job."
"I hope Trump wins because we need a populist and someone who isn’t an employee to the corrupt state but rather working for the American people first. With that said, it’s a breath of fresh air to have someone with his policies carry himself in away that the American people can all respect. This is why I wanted Vivek to win though that was never going to happen, many people can’t get past the way trump talks to actually focus on what he’s trying to do for the country."
"Funniest thing said award goes to Tim Waltz... He said he and VP Harris have firearms and hunt... He might hunt but Harris is not a hunter, she&#39;s a predator. Well, that and he said he was friends with school shooters..."
"We actually could indeed hear you JD - don’t worry. CBS did a poor job at trying to make you look bad. Millions of us are absolutely blown away by how you handled yourself today. Hands down, you killed it on stage today! Thank you for giving us real information and REAL ANSWERS"
Im living in Finland and there have been school shooting here too. <br>Now will Tim be factchecked  as he lied .
"“We’ve got to earn peoples trust back”, in Ohio Jd? Where your party had anti-abortion groups pen the abortion bill summary..   that lied and said the first issue 1 was to protect the will of the people..    f the GOP in Ohio."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbKF3Qt9hg&amp;t=1816"">30:16</a> Wow what an unbiased moderator"
First few sentences in by moderators and theyre already lying about the status of Iran&#39;s attack.on Israel.
"People forget that these folks are supposed to work for the PEOPLE, not the party.   This is a constitutional republic, not a democracy.  Hold these politicians accountable in NOV &#39;24, and fire the ones that are not representing you! GET OUT ADN VOTE"
It should have shown them walk in and greet each other. Small thing but it shows something I think.
"Reject sensorship? Trump wants to shut down media that doesn&#39;t agree with him and jail people who speak out against judges (excluding himself, obviously)"
Fair play to Vance for putting the moderators in their place
I would rather be voting between Vance and Walz than Trump and Harris 🥲
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbKF3Qt9hg&amp;t=3961"">1:06:01</a>"
It is the job of the president to be impartial and talk with different countries. Know the job before you speak
Just like the president debate it&#39;s just one sided on the Donald Trump that&#39;s crazy that they sit here and keep doing this
I like Vance and he did a good job overall. He’s smarter and more poised than the other 3 people on the ticket for sure. He failed on the abortion questions however. He allowed Walz to focus solely on abortion as it relates to life/health of the mother. There is no mainstream Pro-Life position that doesn’t believe in allowing abortion in certain dire circumstances. The issue is abortion as elective birth control which is what the vast majority of abortions are. It’s disappointing and even infuriating to me that there is currently no high ranking politician than can articulate a principled pro-life position.
He looks like an ancestor from the civil war <br>Handsome man !
"Once again, biased moderators...  One-sided and erroneous &quot;fact-checking&quot;; not providing even time to respond, Leading questions to Waltz (giving the answer in teh phrasing of the question)... really pitiful."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbKF3Qt9hg&amp;t=1768"">29:28</a> So aggravating, her trying to dictate &quot;facts&quot; and not allowing Vance to comment"
Vance whines about how it&#39;s congress&#39;fault when he was in office. But Kamala should be getting stuff done without congress approval
Both of these guys know how to talk....but one of them is lying. At least they are actually debating the topics rather than name calling.

Who&#39;s here in September 2024?😂😂The best Decision ever from the Democratic party at the end is to substitute Biden by Kamala Harris.
"What a 💩 show, this is sad it’s happening in “America”. <br>Under Biden this country has become 💩!!!"
Is this real😭
😢😢
Biden really looks disoriented and dumb founded. I sure would hate to be in his shoes in front of millions of viewers!
"Biden the puppet, trump gotta win"

How TF you gone fix the climate y&#39;all be be tryna play god the stuff don&#39;t work you can&#39;t change whats going to happen anyway when you gon wake up

"Trump thought he was running against an easy win tried to take advantage of an feeble old man until out came a warrior, a fighting warrior, a new era ushered in by the name Kamala Harris ✨✨✨💙💙🇺🇸🌎"

"Ada indikasi zelensky menyelewengkan atau menikmati berbagai bantuan militer bersama-sama dengan biden untuk kepentingan pribadi mereka dengan mengorbankan rakyat dan tentara ukraina. Hal ini dapat dilihat dari  banyaknya bantuan militer yang dikerahkan keukraina yang pada akhirnya tidak menghasilkan apapun. Mereka hanya bisa memperlambat tentara rusia, namun tidak pernah ada hasil yang memuaskan bagi ukraina. olehnya itu kita semua patut menduga bahwa bantuan tersebut hanya sebagian yang sampai di Ukraina. Selain itu terlihat pula dari tingginya upaya teror dan penembakan terhadap lawan politiknya. Mungkinkah mereka takut diaudit...???"

Took a shot every time Joe Biden says &quot;and the idea&quot;
FAKE NEWS MSNBC said Crazy Joe won. 😊😂😂😂
Biden is old and becoming senile but he is so much smarter and responding to questions better than Kamala. At least he still know what he is talking about. 😂
Thank you Donald Trump for 4 years of no wars great economy stimulus checks safe borders
Thou shall not kill babies in certain stages
Donald Trump is right Biden &amp; Kamala are allowing in millions of immigrants are going to wipe out social security paying for all these  immigrants making crime rate through the roof no thank you Biden for destroying our country

"Что делать, чтобы наступил мир.

Это не свобода. <br>Это подчинение чужой воле.<br>Цветные революции в ряде стран постсоветского пространства устроенные США и их союзниками привели к нестабильности и разрушениям многих стран. Привели к разрушению мира и благополучия в этих странах, а так же к войнам, где погибли сотни тысяч человек. <br><br>Демократия дискредитировала себя созданием междоусобных прокси войн, свержением неугодных правительств, созданием религиозных расколов и религиозных войн среди христиан и мусульман, растлением нравственности и распространением идеологии гомосексуализма. Кроме того, конфликт Украины с Россией грозит перерасти в ядерную мировую войну.<br>Идёт поддержка демократами из ЕС, США, Англии с помощью оружия воюющей с Россией Украины. Именно демократы поджигают войну, которая не может закончиться из за их адского стремления наказать Россию и поделить её природные ресурсы. Из за зависти к России и ее богатству правителей европейских стран с США идёт сейчас война. Льется кровь невинных мирных людей. <br>Убивают десятки тысяч военных из за алчности политиков США, Англии, Германии, Франции, Италии, Польши, Румынии и т д.<br> Мир поставлен на колени благодаря кланам демократов, придумавших все эти безумные идеи, чтобы взять весь мир в свое единоличное правление. <br>Этому надо положить конец!<br><br>Даже если Россия победит, западные страны и США не смогут исправить свой фашистский звериный образ.  Нужно реабилитироваться. Не только в глазах всего мира, но и сменить ущербный курс приведший человечество к большим жертвам. <br>Демократия должна быть низложена и взят новый принцип на созидание мира во всем мире. <br>О мире перестали говорить, как будто ракеты не могу разрушить густонаселённых страны Европы и переполненные людьми города Америки. Это безумие!!! Демократы заигрались с огнём!<br>В США демократов лучше сменить на республиканцев, таким образом можно запустить освобождение от демократии во всем мире и поменять образ фашизма на реальную свободу для народов от диктатуры демократов. <br>Мир даст новые рабочие места, поднятие экономик стран, улучшение качества жизни людей и самое главное перемены в нравственности и образе жизни людей.<br>Мир должен стать  чище и лучше, без звериной сути демократической утопии обманувшей всё человечество. <br><br><br>What to do to bring peace.

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=200"">3:20</a> listen what  jew controlled said"
Lutus repeats what this old man says
"Without Biden&#39;s health problem, he is more presidential than Kamala. Very strong. They should not have moved him as they did."
where is the comment bout covid he skibided with
Debate be like :<br>Biden : 😦😴<br>Trump : 😏
I love when Trump looks over to Biden when he starts not making any sense and can’t put words together 😂😂😂😂
"Putting everything else aside, the golf tangent was crazy😂"
"That there are people out there that seriously supported Biden, no matter how dement he was, just shows us the state the western world is in. Litarelly erasing itself."
"Vote for Donald Trump? Absolutely,Yes! 💯 It&#39;s time to find America again!"
"Drink a shot everytime jaded joe says &quot;the idea&quot;. <br><br>I think everytime he has that glazed look on his face he is thinking about either his sun lounger on the beach, his bed or purple crayons."
"It’s not funny.. America was recognized as most powerful nation in the world, this current incompetent president proved that it is not. Now China has become more powerful than USA."
"I came here after watching president Trump vs vice president Kamala few days ago. <br>Here I can see, president Biden is trying to be very polite, but president Trump is being more aggressive and yes, maybe healthier. <br>I learn a lot from both debates, about how United States affecting the world and how what happening on this modern World, affecting United States."
This debate was much more productive than  competitive kamala ✨🙌
"330 Million people in the US and its really between these two Clowns to be president 🤡<br><br>I honesty feel sorry for Americans today, stay strong you guys!"
OMGGGGGG
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=5322"">1:28:42</a> Trump: If it&#39;s a fair, legal and good election, absolutely! (As long as I win.)"
"Let&#39;s all vote for Trump!!! He is the bright future of the USA and all the common people. Biden and Harris are a disgrace to the USA, which brought people to poverty and hunger!!!"
Brown William Williams Thomas Taylor Melissa
Who was Biden pointing at when he was entering lol
I never thought a presidential debate would be so funny
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=677"">11:17</a>"
I was taught that there is good and bad in all walks of life.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=3043"">50:43</a>"
"Both of these guys are not supposed to lead anyone, they are supposed to be enjoying retirement"
"I never watched this until now but USA, wow just wow"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yr9d79TNPfc&amp;t=660"">11:00</a> is a turning point in American"

"Trump: Because of his insane, ridiculous and stupid policies…<br><br>Biden: 😵‍💫🫠😦"

I love the way the telecaster still refers to Trump as president😂

Biden looks like he sleeping in some of the debate
Not kamala.. not trump..!! Not vote.!!
"What people HONESTLY think about the 2024 presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Trump <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSeu2aWLjQ8"">https://youtu.be/xSeu2aWLjQ8?si=XNDHaNTZvpxBNmQj</a>"
What are &quot;Black Jobs &quot;?&quot;  Trump has refused to answer what he would do for childcare.  He also didn&#39;t answer the childcare question in his debate with Kamala.
"In two debates, I notice Trump refuses to answer how he is going to deport all the immigrants.  He changes the subject and goes on a rant."
I&#39;m a veteran. Total of about 5 years&#39; worth of combat. I have no help from the VA
"Two months later I finally watched this.<br><br>-It&#39;s so much easier to concentrate on what the candidates are saying when there&#39;s no distracting applause, cheering and jeering from an audience. In studio is a good format.<br><br>-If Biden (who was clearly nervous) had slowed down a bit, he might not have his lost of train of thought as he so embarrassingly did. His facial expression in the beginning even looked like that of a person who was tired and ill. However, his performance (and even the look on his face) did improve over the course of the debate. All in all, not bad for an 81 year old with a speech impediment, but he still made the right decision in no longer resisting the call to step aside. It was time.<br><br>- Trump just looking into the camera does work for him. He also proved he can resist taking the bait and no longer just blathers away even during an opponent&#39;s time. The annoying sniffing appears to be gone, too. Experience seems to have been a good teacher as this was not a bad performance. Still, Trump&#39;s assertion that the environment was well looked after during his administration is laughable, he doesn&#39;t say how he would negotiate a deal between Russia &amp; Ukraine, his addressing of the subject of The Proud Boys continues to be weak, as was his response regarding the January 6th riot.<br><br>In summation: Biden made the right move stepping aside, and Trump should&#39;ve done the same thing. No matter what their records indicate, these guys are both too old. <br>Next time let&#39;s see a match up between people who aren&#39;t past their prime."
Why does everyone call trump president???!<br>He’s NOT
"In short:<br>Trump: You are sucks<br>Biden: No, you are sucks"
Lies
"YEAH BIDEN, HANG YOUR HEAD LOW!"
"Finally ,trump finds his match 😂😂😂"
BIDEN LIED THROUGH THIS ENTIRE DEBATE 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
"I follow the predisential debate between Harris and Trump and see confirmation that it doesn&#39;t matter who the next POTUS is. They both grovel to the Israeli lobby. The only difference is that Harris is indeed dumber than Trump but has a more sympathetic face than Trump. And that will be the deciding factor for the US voters. As a Dutchman, I am only interested in the fact that the US is on the decline. And that is good for the world."

Sigan sacrificando al país. A los ciudadanos. Para seguir con una guerra mundial.
Sigan regalando el dinero a Ucrania
Trump is winer
"Biden acceptable, he won 💯 My friend Joe Biden a smart  politician, competence and action."
Trump is on point.  I know he won the election in 2020 but the Democrats DID NOT allow it.  They forgot to cheat in 2016 because they underestimated us and were overly confident in Hillary.  They will not let him win in 2024.
This was GREAT!! Trump looked so good. He performed well. <br>The upcoming debate when Trump will win be Harris will end up the same.
😢
lol
This CNN is siding with Biden
Biden can’t speak well ! He is eating the words
Biden like a robot
"It’s still legal to have plan B pill so no excuse for needing abortion these days , it should be last resort no used for contraception"
"God he looks old and ill, them silly faces he pulls are unprofessional, trump’s right the world is laughing at America and it’s Bidens fault. What about poor white people why don’t they get help to buy homes or free student loans it’s not fair and it causes racism"
More people died of Covid under Biden then Trump  look it up.

Vote vote for USA. Let’s make it great again he deserves the keys to the White House after the votes were rigged, which we need to pray this doesn’t happen ever again, they crooked the Democrats are possible that’s why they’re hiding in the seller at the White House how to do evil and cheat cheat and lie lie lie that’s why they don’t want the debate to go on open borders open prison cells dying in our country I mean, what’s 911 they’ll be putting rockets in our High tower buildings all over the country. If you don’t get Harris out of the White House, our country will be destroyed. It already is, but it will be worse than you can ever imagine. It’s important to vote.

President HARRİS🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
This was better than the Trump/Harris debate
"The two biggest lies she told — and it was difficult to choose because she said so many — are the one where she said police had been killed on January 6 and the “fine people” lie in Charlottesville. Both lies are demonstrably false. The fine people lie, which has been discredited for years and is documented on video, has also been thoroughly debunked by liberal Snopes."
"Biden actually talked good points on the Nato argument. he just sounds so weak and timid, kinda sad. cause I appreciate him greatly"
Biden must to retire. Him voice is so tired 😢😢😢
Geriatrics debate!

Americans have always helped themselves if we got our jobs back we could help ourselves again
Talk about golf and being convicted and still nothing about American questions like jobs or anything other than healthcare

"You leave off the best line.  One second later, Biden says, “You’re a child”."
fckinu reterda - the whole thing!
"American manufacturers of a number of expensive cars are obliged to stop selling cars to other countries due to the unregulated issuance of loans to people falsifying their income, thus, given further circumstances, it is more profitable to improve the economic reserve, overcrowded prisons and anti-ecology do not suit anyone, this should not have been the case."
"And sleepy joe does it again! Starts off strong, fast, good volume and just comes to a complete stop in the middle of a sentence and forget where he is. That’s some serious skills bro!<br>I remember watching him read off the teleprompter and he’ll say a line and on the screen he’s reading says repeat the line he’ll actually say repeat the line during the sentence. Poor guy."

Jd vance is a fkn liar
<b>ITS  VERY  CLEAR</b>  <b>This  FELLOW  jd vance  LOST  the  DEBATE   With  Mr   TIM  WALZ</b>   1Os  Of  1OOOs  Of  Republican   are  LEAVING  jd  vance   To  JOIN  DEMOCRATS  Mr  TIM  WALZ*
"Y que el verdadero Presidente del 2024, sea nuestro Candidato Republicano Donald J. Trump."
"No sabe usted, lo que me gustaría, que los republicanos, le patearon el trasero a los comunistas, porque en eso se ha convertido el Partido Demócrata. Ahora es el partidos radica, de los comunistas"
"Que equivocado están ustedes. Porque son ustedes los que quieren destruir al País, y disasociaice y quitar el social security, y dicen, que son los republicanos"
JD WON
when does the debate start? It&#39;s hours and hours replaying the same few clips and rallies
"&quot;And though the forest was shrinking, the trees kept voting for the axe, for the axe was clever and convinced the trees that since her handle was made of wood, she was one of them.&quot;"
🤮🤮🤮
Trump could debate if the tables are turned.<br><br>NETWORK: Fox News <br><br>MODERATORS: Jenine Pirro and Jesse Waters.<br><br>FACT-CHECK: Only on Harris
HEADLINE: <br>&quot;CBS MODERATOR VIOLATES DEBATE FACT-CHECK RULES&quot; (That&#39;s called CBS CHEATING! )
"The first time I am feeling, I am in America. That’s the super nice. The beat I ever seen during 20 years. I am here. The boat was very nice a but I would for Trump"
"Moderator: &quot;Senator Vance, you have said you would not have certified the last presidential election.&quot;<br>Vance: &quot;Look at what has happened because Trump was not allowed to remain in office.&quot;"
"Haters, you know Vance lost considerably he lied most of the time"
Nope
He conveniently forgets that food prices are a function of a farm’s overhead which includes the price gouging by industrial billionaires running up costs by buying up farm land and putting higher prices on their products which gets passed along the supply chain and multiplied by the many hands it passes through on the way to market.
Vance really changed my opinion of him tonight. The media had me thinking he was some nut job.<br>Very impressed with how articulate and intelligent he was.
"Haha... Walz didn&#39;t do nothing but show how much better he is than Kamala, she is nowhere even close to his levels, she seems like his secretary now."
Vance won decisively. Idk what Walz strategy was but he agreed with A Lot of Vances points.
Walz and Kamala 2024
"Vance&#39;s interpretation of the abortion issue does not align with their actual stance on the matter. Vance succeeded in pouring a lot of sugar over their opinions, which I would warn all women against. Be careful! Not everything is as it seems!"
Harris and Walz are circus 🤡🤡s. Trump will whip them into line. ❤️DT&amp;JDV. From B.C. 🇨🇦.
Tim Walz literally nodded in agreement when JD Vance said Kamala Harris enabled drug cartels to operate freely in the US.
"Vance won biggy shows how SMART TRUMP is for picking him he <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPoBQuxhjjs&amp;t=94"">1:34</a> would make a terrific president don’t yall agree cnbc"
Tim Walz is a fkn fraud! People !!! Do your homework  get smart! Nothing I N there agenda makes any sense! Lies don&#39;t fix nothin. Twisted burocracy n communism is what will polute this country n it&#39;s already happening
Anyone but Donald Trump for president. Donald Duck would make a better president than Donald Trump
Trump🎉❤
"JD sounds like a car salesman who had my daughter sign an agreement to buy including certain colors are more expensive and the interest rate is inflated but it’s a good buy, NOT, I went back to this bs wheeler dealer and we cut, scissored and threw it in the garbage can. Later, found out the local authorities were looking for him for fraud, money laundering and other charges. Sounding this way isn’t always the case, we’ll see."
"Walz on radio comes across as a common down home blue collar worker with his feet on solid ground, an All American guy. Vance lies on issues of importance and vital to America, spreading slanted misinformation and wishy washy and sneaky clean on his talking points and more of staged platform performer. Definitely, sounds to artificial and sincerely, not genuine."
Vance is a shifty shape shifter ideal a Trump changeling for his lies.
"&quot;I can&#39;t stomach Trump,&quot; J. D. Vance said in an interview with NPR, when describing why he would vote for a third-party candidate. &quot;I think that he&#39;s noxious and is leading the white working class to a very dark place.&quot;"
"J. D. Vance considered voting for Hillary Clinton over Trump: &quot;I think there&#39;s a chance, if I feel like Trump has a really good chance of winning, that I might have to hold my nose and vote for Hillary Clinton.&quot;"
"Since the act&#39;s enactment, over $166 billion in investments in semiconductors and electronics have been announced, showcasing a vigorous response from the industry and a promising future for American technological sovereignty."
"Biden/Harris - A CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law with an aim to bring semiconductor supply chains home. This landmark legislation allocates nearly $53 billion towards U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, research and development, and workforce development."
"Amid this technological push, the U.S. has also seen a remarkable boom in the construction of manufacturing facilities. The U.S. has witnessed a doubling in real manufacturing construction spending since the end of 2021."
"Vance said previously, &quot;My god, what an idiot.&quot; - Vance&#39;s since-deleted tweets criticizing the former president."
BIDEN/HARRIS - Created more manufacturing jobs in 2022 than in any single year in nearly 30 years. A Massive economic bust for China.
U.S. manufacturers are gearing up for a big future and prepping to take supply line issues into their own hands. A new Treasury Department report shines a light on an undeniable surge in U.S. manufacturing.
"Trump the phony Christian couldn&#39;t remember a single Christian prayer before children in church, and the hypocrite couldn&#39;t the words to the &#39;Our Father&#39; - A basic Christian prayer of 66-words."
"FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover spread rumors that the 1950s Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson was gay; ironically, Hoover was gay and Stevenson wasn&#39;t."
"Republican bag of dirty tricks is considerable and there successful.<br>—In 1972, Senator Edmund Muskie was the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination to run against President Richard Nixon. While campaigning in New Hampshire the editor of the all-important Manchester Union Leader received a letter from a New Hampshire citizen accusing Muskie of using the word &quot;Canuck,&quot; a derogatory term for French Canadians-a significant part of the New Hampshire electorate. Muskie never did any such thing.<br>The letter was later discovered to have been written by a White House aide to President Nixon, Kenneth Clawson).<br>-- At the same time, the editor of the Manchester Union Leader insulted Muskie&#39;s wife, calling her unladylike for drinking too much and telling jokes.<br>Muskie then gave a press conference where he was furious and appeared to cry. This ended his quest for the White House."
Of course the moderators had to fact check because they’re hypocrites one-sided couldn’t help yourself could you? TRUMP 2024 💯🇺🇸👱‍♂️❤️
"As of August 2024, the inflation rate in the United States was 2.5%, while wages grew by 4.6%. This means that wages have been growing faster than inflation since January 2023."
"The Secret Papers of Lee Atwater, Who Invented the Scurrilous Tactics That Trump Normalized An infamous Republican political operative&#39;s unpublished memoir shows how the Party came to embrace lies, racial fearmongering, and winning at any cost. - By Jane Mayer"
"Presently, under the radar Biden/Harris despite GOP&#39;s deceptive propaganda efforts - the United States is producing more oil than any country in history, - yes, more oil than any country.<br>And, despite Trump in 2017 who allowed the Saudi&#39;s, to own our Largest Oil Refinery in America, That&#39;s Right TRump Allowed in Texas - the SAUDI&#39;S TO OWN OUR LARGEST OIL REFINERY IN AMERICA - that is disgusting and criminally undermining our economy. Think on that?<br>Trump&#39;s family made a lucrative deal with the Arabs. Spiking the cost at our fuel pump.<br>And, later, yes, the Trump (Kushner) family, get a $2 Billion dollar payback,<br>and the Republican House sits on their hands and wear Trump&#39;s mask. Isn&#39;t this a treasonable offense?"
"Remember: Trump asked oil execs at Mar-a-Lago for $1 billion for his campaign.<br>In return, Trump pledged to reverse environmental protections and cut their taxes.<br>The deal would net Big Oil $110 billion in tax breaks — 11,000% more than a $1 billion donation.<br>Utter corruption."
"Would any parent on the planet earth allow their teenager to say the same things as Trump?<br>Wash my mouth with soap and blow soap suds!<br>Would any teenager on the planet earth remain in their homes with parents who believe trumps crap do repeat his crap<br>sit in his crap<br>serve his crap over breakfast, lunch and supper<br>and watch his parents vote<br>and throw<br>on our U.S. Constitution. Yes, that&#39;s a teenager who needs to scream out at a canyon and echo his guts out!"
"By the time Trump announced his candidacy on June 16, 2015, the U.S. intelligence community was reportedly already aware of the Kremlin&#39;s interest in Trump. According to The Wall Street Journal, in spring 2015, &quot;US spy agencies captured Russian government officials discussing associates of Mr. Trump, including Mr. [Paul] Manafort,&quot; who would later serve as the second of Trump&#39;s three campaign heads."
"Heads Up America-Russian posts are often accompanied by variations of the same hashtag,<br>&quot;Grow a spine and vote Jill Stein.&quot;<br>&quot;This hasn&#39;t gotten enough attention,&quot; said Andrew Weiss, a Russian expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, referring to Moscow&#39;s and Putin&#39;s efforts to promote Stein, on the Green Party ticket.<br>An NBC News analysis found that Russians working under the direction of the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg-based firm run by a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, tweeted the phrase &quot;Jill Stein&quot; over 1,000 times."
"Setoodeh said he began interviewing the former president for his book in 2021. He added that he spoke with Trump, aged 78, (be in his eighties soon) and is mentally regressing after six interview sessions, adding,<br>&quot;Donald Trump had severe memory issues,&quot;<br>Setoodeh claimed. &quot;As the journalist who spent the most time with him, I have to say, he couldn&#39;t remember things. He couldn&#39;t even remember me.&quot;"
"Trump reported millions in negative income in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2020, and he paid only $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017."
"Trump often reports zero charitable donations year in and year out, IRS returns show.<br>What did Trump show during his time in office - he reported $1.8 million in charitable giving in 2017, and just over $500,000 in charitable donations in 2018 and 2019, the returns show.<br>What da??"
"In 2017, Trump&#39;s first year in office, he also made $6.5 million from China, the returns show.<br>The source of the China payments is not clear from the returns. The payments were a hypocritical surprise."
"Unfortunately, 2017 tax law that was the signature achievement of Donald Trump&#39;s administration will cost 50% more than originally forecast, because wealthy taxpayers have found loopholes that significantly reduce their tax burdens.<br>That&#39;s according to a report released Thursday by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget, which advocates for fiscal restraint.<br>Extending the Trump tax cuts would cost the Treasury Department $4 trillion over 10 years, up from $286 billion in 2018."
"Trump meets w/ Putin. Then, on 8/3/2019, just 3 days later, Trump requests a list of US spies.<br>That&#39;s right!<br>By 2021 the CIA reports a high number of their agents are being captured and/or murdered. An FBI search at Mar A Lago finds more documents w/ lists-our top spies."
"Thom Hartmann<br>Hamas apparently knew how to get around Israel&#39;s Iron Dome defenses, fascinating. - They (Hamas) probably learned this from Iran. Iran almost certainly got the information from Russia.<br>And who gave it to Russia? Sure looks like (via Mar-a-lago USA top secret) Donald Trump, at the request of Putin."
"The national debt had risen by almost $7.8 trillion during Trump&#39;s time in office. That&#39;s nearly twice as much as what Americans owe on student loans, car loans, credit cards and every other type of debt other than mortgages, combined, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It amounts to about $23,500 in new federal debt for every person in the country."
"A former Wharton student stated &quot;Professor Kelley told me 100 times over three decades that &quot;Donald Trump was the dumbest goddam student I ever had.&quot; | remember his emphasis and inflection — it went like this - &quot;Donald<br>Trump was the dumbest goddam student I ever had.&quot; Dr. Kelley told me this after Trump had become a celebrity but long before he was considered a political figure. Dr. Kelley often referred to Trump&#39;s arrogance when he told of this - that Trump came to Wharton thinking he already knew everything.&quot;<br>-- this isn&#39;t surprising, but his propaganda machine will say the absolute, absolutely the opposite. Trump is"
"Schwartz called writing, &#39;The Art of the Deal, his<br>&quot;greatest regret in life, without question,&quot; and both he and the book&#39;s publisher, Howard Kaminsky, alleged that Trump had played no role in the actual writing of the book. -<br>- So the fraud set its groundwork.<br>A no role - a phony - but he blabbered mouthed from the gulf coast to the Canadian borders, and went east coast to west coach preaching &#39;The Big Lie&#39; and this serial felon lied all the way to the Banks, and profited &#39;the Big Lie!&#39; America bought the &#39;Biggest Lie, and was and is not who he says he is.<br>He didn&#39;t write a word, &#39;The Art of the Deal, and is an author only of lies. Many bought into it, and here we are."
"Ed &#39;Big Al Bundy&#39; O&#39;Neill, &quot;Psychopaths like Trump have a tendency to lie a lot and make stuff up to make themselves feel that they are bigger, better, smarter, better looking, and superior to everyone else than they really are.<br>— will lie to inflate their ego and to get what they want no matter what the consequences are.<br>— That is why there should be safeguards that would detect Psychopaths and prevent them from infiltrating Government and Business because they are a threat to all of society.<br>- And the more Psychopaths that make it up to the top of the business and government ladder, the more the world will likely perish due to them.&quot; -<br>- Ed &#39;Big Al Bundy&#39; O&#39;Neill added. &quot;I&#39;ve got a doctorate from YSU, an honorary doctorate that I&#39;m going to give back,&quot; O&#39;Neill reportedly said.<br>&quot;I don&#39;t want it. I&#39;m going to start calling it Trump-U. And I think a lot of people feel that way.&quot;"
Vance won decisively. Idk what Walz strategy was but he agreed with A Lot of Vances points.
JD killed it!
Creep Tim .
CBS is almost worst that CNBC.
Vance just demolished Walz.
Jd Vance destroyed whatever that other guy was. And CBS .
Why didn&#39;t Tim mention that  TRAMP&#39;S a convicted FELON &amp; RAPIST!
Walz wins. Vance &amp; Trump to the TRASH
CBS is garbage and anybody that thinks CBS ain&#39;t his garbage 😆
WALZ IS GETTING SPANKED😂😂😂
Waltz history as pathetically Socialist as demise of Democratic Republic. Remember this because harbinger of Fed Corruption &amp; Dysfunction
Before we start does anyone need tampons😂
I LOVE HER 😍
"Im gone.  Guy who is watching this, is not worth my time because of TDS."
Looks to me like Vance is winning with common sense🇺🇸🇺🇸!!!
Without a MN reference Walz has nothing to say?
Vance &amp; Trump have annoying voices
Timmy looks kinda panicked. He sure has a lot of times he &quot;mis-speaks&quot;!
VANCE BEATING THE PANTS OFF OF THE KOTEX KWEEN!!!😂
VANCE BEATING THE PANTS OFF OF THE KOTEX KWEEN!!!😂
Unfairly moderated….not surprising
This seems so normal when we don&#39;t have an orange demented clown.
I&#39;ve heard 3 separate lies fall out of JD&#39;s face.
Never have any of us seen two bigger clowns than the laughing she and the tampon him.
"If (big if) Kammie and Walz win the election and something should happen to Kamala, that would mean this guy would be president of the free world with his finger on the bottom. God help us!!!!! He ran away from his troop -- Vance went to a foreign country to be with his troop."
Will Walz be wearing special &quot;talking&quot; earrings?!🙄🙄🙄
Dude dont even know what his daughter eats and disrespected her after she told him.  the level of manipulation to try to make a positive note of harris and walz is intense.
Are you and your commentators going to be unbiased? My guess would be no. . We will see
Ba ha ha ha ..what is this buffoonery?
What momentum? Whoa re you talking about?  This some come from kind of joke pundit?
He is a pure idiot
LIARS Trump &amp; Vance are Devil LIARS
Vance is CLOSETED GAY
"And these 2 dumpsters will introduce mpox which has been researched since 1971<br> Illegals flown in are known to carry Cholera, Typhoid, HIV and other illnesses. ..None were isolated, examined."

I will see if any of the other channels give a fairer presentation….respectfully
"Will Walz give JD the middle finger, like he did to the people at the stadium,  when he doesn&#39;t like a remark?"
A vote for Kamala is a vote for war..
I don’t think Minnesota is at all attractive to the rest of the country. I don’t think being from Minnesota is a selling point.
So far it’s all Walz -where is the equal representation leading up to the debate? And the lies!!!!! This is why mainstream media is so lacking in truth and so shamefully biased.
"no... yall are creepy.  especially to not actually talk about anything.  no issues which are becoming still to this day more and more non ignorable. <br>yall attack your opponents they give us hope with words then yall resound by either attacking them again,  copying or 1uping their promises without coming up with your own. and siren right talking about yourselfs. <br>fir example in this video when tim commiserate teumps presidency as a disaster that&#39;s the biggest lie compared to what you said Bidens was.  Covid was ending during the transfer of power and biden ended covid by shutting down our financial relief.... <br>biden and kamala has done nothing for any of us but a lot of something for everyone else.  <br><br>the new leader of the UN compliments trump for biting back and forcing everyone else to pay up and support their neighbors, because we .... US &lt;-- should not have to come out of our pockets anymore than we already do to keep Navy <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23hooyah"">#Hooyah</a> ships at sea everywhere.  <br>the UN leader has agreed that everyone else in the UN is not too poor to contribute anymore.  <br>If you want to start delusional that&#39;s in you.  if you have an argument with all that I&#39;m saying; respond. and i expect everyone else that feels the way i do,  dem or rep to also respond to this comment.  <br>are we not more tired and aggregated than ever before? a week as struggling? <br>Senior citizens please here this.  you are retired. your children and their children are not.  we have to carry this all on after we prepare your funerals,  do you care about how our retirement is? do you care if we have to deal with and pay for war until 2048?"
Word Salad on the menu tonight for the blue voters 😂
Vance/Trump 2024
"Oh the laughing hieena, 😅😅😅😅😅 especially when he was dancing in his underware at the gay pride parade. What a great thing to have as a vice president, someone to ĺooķ,up to and be so proud of......"
He is terrible ..... why did Camel choose him!?
"Trump , Trump, Trump"
"Oh my gosh, this just keeps getting better.  Waltz gets off the plane and one person clapps"
Tim is a weirdo and videos to prove it!
Tim is the best
"Vance is a vile man with a thing against women and immigrants, now that he’s a full on Trumper"
A waltz this man does not need tampons nor do any other men
Wipe up the floor with them JD
Does Piers Morgan ever get through an interview without talking across people and not letting other people finish their sentences?
I feel I’m either 100% with piers Morgan or 100% against him. This time I’m 100% with him
blair looks like she did one of those uncanny makeup trends
That’s his wife???!!! 😮🤨🧐
Piers Morgan should invited nick avocado to the show
Margot Squares
I used to like sweets!
&quot;plus size&quot;.. its called fat
Fatty

Weak men are dangerous
How is he a father............must have one humungous penii
"Being happy in one&#39;s skin, is not the same as flouting being out of shape.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s doing that.  He&#39;s just being happy and himself.  If he could lose weight, I&#39;m sure he would.  We don&#39;t anyone regarding of whether we agree w/ their state of being, to be unhappy in their own skin."
No way missionary goes on in that bedroom
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iPqwf01s64&amp;t=382"">6:22</a> theirs that insecurity I knew was there. He projects it on to his wife. Got it 👍🏾"
Well someone&#39;s punching above his weight...😮😮
Is funny the person that have debating how all that surgery on her face
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iPqwf01s64&amp;t=48"">0:48</a> &quot;Really? That&#39;s what people are watching?&quot; My thoughts exactly."
The fact that he is promoting obesity is shocking I was near 20 stone and had a shock at the doctors and within a year I have dropped over 4 stone by completely Changing my diet and walking more if he feels happy in his own skin fair enough that&#39;s up to him but promoting junk food and bad diets aren&#39;t right I have been down the same road I was living of junk food takeouts dinners enough to feed 2 people plus dessert afterwards only going to work and home nothing in-between days of work all i done was eat all day and I know it&#39;s hard to change but it just takes something to click now im eating 3 times a day and haven&#39;t had any takeouts apart from when I&#39;m in Spain in over a year if your happy in your own body fair enough but don&#39;t promote bad diets or junk food
Internet has killed most things
Genetics 🤣
Well done Piers
"If you google old fat people and hit images, not too many pictures show up. That says it all."
Why
"I liked piers but lately he is just being rude,always right  and just generally a 😂"
Why would they bring in some random trans dude to talk about this lol who cares
"This interview was badly handled, Piers could have allowed the man to speak more rather than talking over him and doing too much"
That Blaire White person has a Michael Jackson nose replica on her face. <br>What&#39;s going on in the world Lol
Maybe he can rent himself out as a  blimp character in the Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Parade. Or have &#39;GOODYEAR&quot; painted on his side so he can float over the Rose Bowl on New Year&#39;s Day.
that thing had babies with that lady ?
"People choose themselves what they put in their body, like if you seen a crackhead promoting crack, you wouldn&#39;t start taking crack, leave this guy alone ffs"
"What&#39;s funny is that there have been actual studies that have been done that show when you work out your body releases endorphins which is basically a dopamine rush, making you feel good. It doesn&#39;t make sense to not workout."
His wife is so cute people say you need to stay lean and muscular to get girls n look at him😂
Holy cow
"Why not promote healthy eating, show how to eat sensibly, exercise regularly"
They better leave my girl Abby out of this- not that it should matter but her account is now being used to document her weightloss journey
Blair White is very beautiful even though it cost a lot of money to get there!
lol she won’t stay with him for long
His wife is kinda bad
This is why aliens don&#39;t visit us....
"I agree with Piers, but if he’s not even going to let him speak, then he shouldn’t invite him on his show."
I think I&#39;m moving to the UK we&#39;re truth and facts are aloud
Start your day with some brain
That&#39;s his wife...? She&#39;s gotta be mental.
I&#39;m here one year later but I doubt the Fatvocate -fat advocate is.
The bigger you get. The more your heart works.
craig
fat and obese are not the same
Thats why glutonny became a sin.
"OK, so as anybody ever heard of the dangers of botox? 🤣 She&#39;s there talking about the dangers of obesity."
She came for the fame and stayed for the life insurance.
He just influenced me to go to the gym
Why would you record yourself eating a Reese&#39;s peanut butter cup? People are weird af
The one time I agree with Pierce.
"Hey fatty bom bom, chill out on those cheese burgers and you might be able to spend some of that money and be with your family"
Piers should have Nikokado Avocado on his show
He must earn some serious coin if he&#39;s able to pull that bird
What a pointless segment. That was just inviting some dude on to berate him and his wife about his weight.
Nothing like being a big pile of s*** and trying to make it look cool as an influencer
"Denying the actual definition of what you are is part of the whole problem, you are denying you have a problem. &quot;Well, let&#39;s not call it..... &lt;insert every adjective that describes you to a T.&gt;&quot;<br>Also, pretty sure his gf has a fat fetish."
"I mean.. Piers is also fat and he was eating burgers on his program with celebration, so I find it funny that he is the one to say what is healthy and what is not."
The look in his wife’s eyes you can see she is waiting for him to choke on a donut
Reject modernity.  Embrace masculinity
the american done my head in dissing george but shes got thousands worth of cosmetics on her face
425
"the wife is a feeder, she will feed him till she klills him and then move on"
His favorite band must be OB/CD
His wife is like Jill Biden. Complicit
Over 30 stone
At least George is a real person unlike Blaire. She looked like a doll with her plastered on make up and her lipstick placed higher than her upper lip. Give me real people like George and not these fakes.
One of the rare occasions where I totally agree with Piers.
"This was such a misfire, both Piers and Blaire (wild choice for a guest btw) and all the comments are just talking around this guy purely because of his weight. <br><br>He clearly said he’s not proud of his weight, he wouldn’t recommend for anyone to gain weight like he did, that he appreciates the health risks and that there is an issue with obesity in the UK, and that he’s currently working to lose weight!! <br><br>His videos are for fun and (now) money. He’s literally making fun of himself in his videos. <br><br>Why is everyone talking like this is a body positivity activist! He’s trying to lose weight, the body positivity cult would crucify him! <br><br>It was like Piers wasn’t even interviewing the person in front of him, he wasn’t listening at all. They literally said he was working on losing weight and Piers not long after says “why don’t you go on a fitness/weight loss journey and show that?” ????"
Those food tic toks gave me ptsd discusting
"These people just benefit of the age we live in, even thought none of it is thanks to them... If it were just 1000 or even a 100 years ago, they&#39;d be the first one to go. There&#39;s no place in nature for this, natural selection would deal with those very very quickly"
"Nothing funny about it, he is in total denial 😂"
108.9 on your dial!
"Well most Trump supporters fall into the obese category.  I know, because I’ve been to 3 of his rallies.   🤷🏻"
Is that craig from ppl just do nothing
His wife is fine 👌 But he’s 🤮 🤮
Interesting topic. I just wish Pierre’s didn’t constantly talk over guests like he does in this video
Fat influencers should not be allowed to be around children
Is that Harvey&#39;s dad? (Katie Price)
One of George’s influencers insulted me for being slim.
"Private health care doesn’t cover A&amp;E or ambulances, or intensive care of any form. <br><br>Nice try, but you can’t use that to get off the hook. And in all fairness, there’s a high chance you’ll use all 3 as you’re one breath away from a heart attack or stroke….."
"Planet Earth is done, doomed and finished."
Its just immature hes in his late 30s just grow up and get a proper job 😂😂
"its a spit in the face for people like me with psoriasis (which can&#39;t be cured), who has occasional flare ups, that these obese people wanna share this body positivity movement with people who actually have unfixable circumstances"
Pounds in excess pounds 😂😂😂 that one got me😂😂
Piers is honestly being so disrespectful but he usually is. I agree with some of what he’s saying but the way he’s communicating is going to make people not want to do anything. They may even do the opposite in spite of his rude comments
There’s no way that’s his wife bro she’s way too hot for him
They make money getting fat and then they make money losing weight. Come on people. Contribute to the f ing world.
he makes piers morgan look thin
"Just clicked on the video to say it&#39;s unfair to show the frame of the obese man on a wider frame than that of piers. May not have been intentional but it shows so much meaning of the two. A lack of balance, such as the conversation and showcasing more of the body of the man in doing so. Piers is not a healthy looking man either, and to shoot both subjects this way is already putting in a negative impression. Bad journalism."
As said by the slim and slender piers morgan 😭🤣
Heart attack doesn’t care about you body positively! Diabetes doesn’t care about that!
Im more stunned that he got a girl like that and had a kid with her.....clearly money talks
Feel bad for that girl dude probably stunk
The bad effect of obesity on the body is too much consequence in having the same lifestyle as him well I guess he is earning money and he is living a yolo life
Blaire has no right to talk with that plastic face.
If you can be so easily be influenced by someone then you must be weak minded to begin with.
fat people should pay more.....insurance as well
How is paying for an Xtra seat raising them prices for others? Here he goes again running his mouth while clueless.
It&#39;s not as bad as an overweight woman trying to give me diet advice and telling me I need to be eating vegetables (I love vegetables so I don&#39;t need to be encouraged) But she was completely unaware that she was bigger than I am. I&#39;m not that big. I didn&#39;t ask her for advice! But people are always trying to analyze things that don&#39;t involve them at all and they know nothing about.
No discrimination.  Get your head out of the chicken bucket.  I&#39;m a big man 6&#39;5&quot; 285 lbs.  I fly either business or first class.  I don&#39;t whine about it.
"When it pertains to women, this is what *I think*:
<br>
<br>*Thicc*: female proportions and the curves are a bit more exagerated/bodyfat-augmented than average.
<br>*Fat*: You have a BMI of &gt; 29 and a fat percentage of &gt;30% and most importantly out of proportion
<br>*Plus-size*: All your features (incl muscles, joints, etc) are bigger than average, but you still see the female silhouette because of good fat distribution
<br>*Big*: fat
<br>*Plump*:  average fat% but BMI &gt;27 and lacking proportion
<br>*chubby*: plus-size but petite
<br>*curvy*: plus-size or thicc
<br>
<br>Fat is the only one here <b>I think</b> is objectively unhealthy and mostly unattractive"
Kids have become ultimate brats!
She needs too use boat travel they can accommodate 😅
No how about losing some weight so you can fit into one seat and not be a safety hazard to everyone on your flight.
It’s all effin ridiculous.
Children and young people are so thin skinned nowadays.
"confused, if you&#39;re offended she said &quot;girls&quot; then you should be offended by calling a school a &quot;girls&quot; school? HYPOCRISY"

"All plus sized people should be given absolutely no benefits or special treatment for being fat whatsoever, in fact, ban them from all flights."
The time is coming when the label &quot;racist&quot; will be something to be proud of.I am proud to carry that label.
"Plus size 😂 How is that nicer than just saying fat? Or, more accurately,  morbidly obese."
"I mostly arrive last in most areas , but I try not to bug people about it."
Too bad…. Go on a diet. I’m skinny maybe I should get half off huh
well we werent the one making her plus size.
Today&#39;s generation is challenging reality itself
Then LOOSE weight‼️‼️
Tall people don’t get more leg room unless they buy a business or first-class seat. They can’t change their height. FAT people CAN work on changing their weight.
if she doesn&#39;t identify as a girl she/he/it should be banned from ONLY girls school....
That&#39;s why airplanes have cargo  area 😅😅
"Why call them Plus Size?  Just say Fat, that’s what they are"
But where does Piers find these obnoxious people who can&#39;t differentiate between reality and stupidity? And that woman should not travel in Airplanes and even if she does then she should check in as luggage and not passenger
"I’m the first to agree that airplane seats are too small. But until or unless that is ever resolved, instead of being entitled, maybe have some compassion for the person who is being squished up next to you?"
"That happened to my sons bus driver once. He would get to the school and dismiss the “ladies first” and then the boys. Of course, you had to have that one student make a stink over it and the bus driver got in trouble over it."
It is the first time I agree with him 100%.
Ahh Diabetty<br><br>Run or she&#39;ll eat your babies
Slob.
"Dear lord. They have to pump an extra ton of fuel into the plane to carry those land-whales so they already add 1.5 tons to the plane. Girl, ...there are physical limits. They are only two or three all-you-can-eat buffets away from needing a C5-Galaxy. What will happen then? A petition for a second transport rack?"
The world has gone bananas!  This generation has no respect for authority.  All thin non-binary is rubbish!   Teachers these days have no rights.  STFU <del>-Love Piers Morgan--</del>
The select few…are the few members of fat acceptance who are still alive… not the ones of average size.
Perhaps the airlines should provide accommodations on their freighters  for these entitled buffalo gals.
Agree
Can’t argue with stupidity .
Well she must always get double at McDonald’s .
When did being a girl or woman become a dirty word
If people have to pay extra for heavy luggage then obese people should do the same thing
"I can remember a time when people flew they dressed properly they behaved themselves and if someone behaved badly they were shocked and horrified, today people act like they don&#39;t have a single living brain cell."
How did the teacher know the girl identified as a boy ffs
Its just pathetic
"Im surprised she is allowed to travel on regular planes, she should go on cargo!"
"Love the university clip, gives me hope"
Billy o Reilly has let himself go
When I send air cargo I pay by the kg - why should that girl that likes eating not be treated as cargo
Naah you should pay extra
Rancors go in the hold
LIBBY WOMAN
"LOL this is exactly what happens when people are allowed access to the internet, the delusion is they think it gives them authority or entitlement. I wish I&#39;d studied sociology at school. Because cognitively people are seriously struggling with sanity and it&#39;s having a detrimental effect on society."
She recommends concrete steps bc that’s all that can support her😂
Obesity is not the airlines fault it’s yours
So the fat girl gets extra seats. I bet she’ll say something like skinny people should share seats
There are those planes that crate up hippopotamus’ to move them around. She should use that.
"The name, plus size , gives relief for pigs, to being pigs."
"I wanted go to journalist school, then I was educated. I got a butt lift, Botox, and transcranial  magnetic stimulation. Now I don’t offend anyone. It’s a thing."
Thought ‘fly’ meant beautiful. Going to stay home.
I want to know where his plug goes
He wants to know where man tampons go.
How about a nice seat in the cargo area.
US Universities have lost their quality and credibility
One word: salad
"Just as your carry on luggage has to fit certain dimensions your body should also fit in the seat without spill over and discomfort to other fliers.  If this woman is too large for the seat then put this woman, and her luggage, on a cargo flight and charge her fare by the pound.  I am tired of people who can&#39;t live by the rules demanding special treatment."
The first one was wild
Lose weight
Everybody is entitled to dignity and respect.<br>But not two seats for the price of one.<br>America has been socially assaulted by the left for years now. We are a tolerant people and have done our best to accommodate various segments of society that are out of the norm.<br>This tolerance has served to enable the extremists. And America&#39;s moderates have had enough. November&#39;s presidential election will serve to show less about Trump and more a horrified disenfranchisement with Biden.
Lose weight 😅
I’m a fat guy and I couldn’t agree more! Over the last six years I’ve lost 150 pounds. Before I lost weight I bought two seats on a plane. My fat. My cost.
Dont be PLUS sizef then
Ummmm…so airlines should install sofas for fat girls???
She&#39;s so healthy that she needs oxygen and can&#39;t even walk down the length of a plane without a wheelchair
"I&#39;d never support that petition. Obese people should pay double. They cause more fuel consumption, thus more pollution etc. Etc."
she looks like an massively over wieght brett cooper
This whole „The majority has to conform to the minority.“ will never work. It‘s an unsustainable fad.
Whenever someone screams „Your racism is showing.“ I have to laugh.
I feel sorry for the passengers next to the lady
"Make sure the travel industry serves everyone not just a select few? Your part of the select few they have to go so far out of their way for, cus you can&#39;t walk to airport gates, can&#39;t carry luggage, can&#39;t sit in a normal seat, probably can&#39;t sleep in standard hotel beds, can&#39;t sit in any sort of hot weather, can go on any excursions without assistance and special measures. <br><br>Yet you have the gaul to demand more."

"Being unhealthy and proud isnt a reason to be unhealthy. Youre ashamed of yourself and are grasping at straws to feel validated because you&#39;re unwilling to change. <br>This includes trans - if youre unwilling to change, to realize that how you feel isnt a moral justification to change the definition of what a woman is nor to force irresponsible opinions on the rest of society.

Pierce: Because you’re a Beast<br><br>Me: you just proved their point of bullying.
High demand anybody with obesity to lose the weight and stop telling other to accept them for being fat.fst is a unhealthy State for the body why should we have to accept it
Do we need larger exit rows are I doubt she would get out.
Waiting for the “we need a larger luggage allowance because our clothes are bigger”
I do not want to sit next to you.
"“Plus size”- typical obfuscating euphemism.<br>Medical term is : morbidly obese. <br>Eat less, weigh less. Eat more, buy two tickets. Accountability for one’s actions is good for one’s mental health."
&quot; PLUS SIZE &quot; Means Porker!
Kevin is the problem and definitely not part of the solution…
Love your work Piers…
The woman is grotesque with a total lack of self control.
They need more seats? What they need to do is lose weight.
At least this woman never hacked a murder victims phone.
Ever notice that really obese people have a permanent frown on both  sides of their mouths? Lol i only see it on fat people
Piers Morgan is &quot;ludicrous.&quot;
I think she might require the whole plane to herself -- which sounds completely fair to me.  My concern would be that she might eat the plane -- and the entire crew -- before they have a chance to do their jobs.
Airline seats should generally be bigger.
"Who cares, whatever happened to individualism"
"Shame has value when it comes from within, you dont need more from the outside. The argument that smoking is also bad or &quot;other stuff is bad too&quot; isnt an argument, you should try to be healthy where you find it worth while since being 100% perfect is impossible. Glorification of morbid obesity should not be allowed, just as we dont allow people to glorify drugs or gambling, obviously. Insane to me people have this &quot;i can do whatever i want because its my body&quot; mentality when you have children who depend and rely on you, absolute nonsense of people just justifying what they do because they dont want to think of actual consequences. I think these messages like that prey on people in vulnerable states who are looking for any reason to keep doing what they are doing instead of getting the possible help for the underlying problems they have."
The thing is peirs is asking a man who is pretending to be a woman if being fat is wrong <br>It&#39;s not something that makes sense
"cmon we all know there&#39;re a lot of people who have fat-fetish to be fair, it take like 1/4 to 1/3 out of all the rule 34 gallery including super fat characters, especially fat furries"
I hate tv interviews because its literally just <br>&quot;Im great and right!&quot; <br>&quot;No you&#39;re wrong!&quot; <br>&quot;Blahblahblahnouourewronginrightaaaa-&quot; <br>&quot;Sorry we&#39;re out of time goodbye!!!&quot;
"Coming from someone who was 140lbs over weight, it&#39;s horrible to be that big, and there&#39;s nothing glorious about it. Get off your lazy ass, quit shoveling food down your throat,  and change your life!  I was fat shamed and it was a good thing! I appreciate it!"

"Ah come on guys healthy food is cheaper than fast food and it&#39;s cheaper than THAT AMOUNT of food regardless.<br>Just buy groceries and cook. If your standard for food are delivery apps, then yeah, &quot;healthy&quot; is more expensive."

The fact that this man managed to make a 21 minute reaction video out of a 7 minute video is insane lmfaoo
Saw the thumbnail on this old video and my first thought was is this guy still alive?
The “meta” for a fat man having an attractive girlfriend or wife is if he has money. That isn’t new or unique. Women mostly just care about money so being fat is nearly inconsequential.
(I do agree on your take with alcohol... this country has a load of alcoholics)
"Correction AsNoitall:  it is NOT a God given right to be obese.  It&#39;s a intentional &quot;devil may care&quot; cause in harming your own body, that God gave you, leading to induced health issues and death.  This IS NOT a God given right.  Killing yourself slowly over-eating foods, and then making a big joke of it.  The wife could care less of the health risk to her husband... as long as she&#39; getting free air-time on TikTok.  It&#39;s a free will choice, yes, but with all the fucked-up people out there, he&#39;s sending the wrong signals or impressions to being fat.  And to that, God does not look kindly on.  You are accountable to God first and for most...."
Let’s do it ? Ok! ✅
"Why do people say eating healthy is expensive, its way cheaper. Even if it wasn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t buying less food, and eating healthy be cheaper."
From all the bad shit you can see and learn from the internet.. there will always be more..
When culture is based on corporate needs.
In my country there is no single unhealthy thing that cost less than healthy food

&quot;Let&#39;s do it&quot;. I&#39;m dying over here😂
Jeez how much work did he get done to look like that?
Also any rational person knows how much he weighs pretty accurately without him saying. Someone of that size is about 700 pounds.
This is just fucking ridiculous at this point some people are fat because the worst type of food for you is the cheapest option growing up keeping fresh fruit and vegies wasn’t cheap for a snack but it was easier to buy a bag of chips and because ur a kid and u don’t know how to tell ur self no so u eat till ur full and then u put the bag of chips away then a few hours later mama makes dinner and u eat till ur full again its not that parents encourage bad eating habits its just i didn’t know how badly my habbits were untill i put some weight on shit happens u can’t say fat is unhealthy because fat is normal its apart of animal kingdom we get fat to hibernate it just extra food storage just loads of people now don’t need a diet they need to fast

Oh no.  His chick is into it.
Make soft drink and  potato ship aisles in supermarket thin so only skinny people can buy that shit.
If I’m not mistaken I think he has died since this….
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=217"">3:37</a> There he is. In the fat… I mean flesh."
Anatole never fails to prove me right
"For tens of thousands of years humans had to work very hard to acquire food. For the majority of our existence we broke even in terms of energy gain vs energy expense with food. The gain was slightly more give the fact that we&#39;re still around, obviously. <br>It&#39;s only for the last couple of decades where food has become so widespread available in extreme abundance, topped off with a capitalistic system who&#39;s single purpose it is to sell the consumer as much as possible, and you got the perfect recipe for a global obesity epidemic. <br>Human&#39;s are literally gorging themselves to death as a result of our own success. We&#39;re not cognitively wired to resist our urges to eat, it&#39;s a result of thousands of years of habit and evolution. What we can do however is become consciously aware of this phenomenon and teach our kids how to responsibly handle food. Which is the exact opposite of body positivity"

"He is hurting other people by doing this though, not only is he encouraging others to be obese, he&#39;s putting a burden on the nhs a system that everyone pays for."
"I find it funny, being a fat man myself, is that all those people are the ones ranting on twitter asking for freedom of speech, freedom of whatever, but when it comes to something they disagree, they are all against it. Fat people, gay people, what ever.. so it&#39;s freedom of speech as long as you agree with it. LoL.<br>Cmon, let people be fat, gay, bi, whatever, what others do have zero influence on my life."
"Seriously. I dont think its that bad. Most of them die before 50/60 but still pay taxes and contribute to society. If someone has data and statistics that show that most of them dont work because of health issues I will retract this, but these 350 plus pound cases are of the rarer kind, at least in my country.  Most of them are 220-300. They can walk and work, just no sports etc."

Have them watch the movie &quot;the whale&quot;
Since they are influencing many others to be obese that is why it costs the country so much money. they may have private healthcare but the people they influence to do this lifestyle do not so essentially they do contribute to that cost

My uncle is a truck driver the donkey show isn’t just an old thing the odds of him telling me this story yesterday then this popping up is funny as hell
Sayin that someone who lives until 50&#39;s and die of obesity costs more than someone who lives healthy until thei 90&#39;s are insane.
"How that guy is living his life is no one&#39;s business. He&#39;s getting a lot of money from his videos, I&#39;m sure the ones complaining about him are the ones watching those videos."
&quot;death cult&quot; is the best definition I&#39;ve ever heard for the fat positivity movement.

When you&#39;re too fat for a hoyer lift, legs leaking with lymphedema and won&#39;t even help turn yourself you break the backs of the people tasked to care for you. It&#39;s unfair and robs the elderly of time for caregivers."
Obesity is gross
Bros gonna influence for a couple years until he dies…. So it can’t be that big of a deal LOL bros got another couple years to go until his heart fails
Americans need to return to Jesus Christ.
Absolutely it should be allowed!…..fucking you are hilarious and I love you!!
I love Blair White
Fatfluencers?!
Sad
How do they afford this lifestyle
14 mins in I couldn’t disagree more mate. Unless you were raised in poor Britain in the 90s you have no idea how little we knew about nutrition. Knowbody cared. I didn’t know fruit has sugar till I started a kitchen job at 16. My grandparents used to give us sugar sandwiches if we were hungry cause it tasted like cake and no one could afford cakes. This is real life bro. I’m now 33 and go to great lengths just to maintain a chubby physique and not of over the deep end. I will forever have issues around food now because of that time. That’s why schools try so hard now to teach about healthy eating. Also when I was a kid sugar was in no way a bad thing. Fat was the enemy in all forms.
"Literally the only thing a man should and must eat, is pure natural meat. Veggies and fruits are just a gmo hoax..... People eat this crap since the end of 1940&#39;s event. Back in history this was &quot;food&quot; for slaves to keep them weak but yet alive to do the work they were suppose to do. Meat was only for the strong and rich."
"I agree that people should be allowed to do whatever as long as it doesnt hurt others. HOWEVER, this is harmful. It gives the impression that being morbidly obese is fun and you will be happy. It encourages people to not eat healthy or work out and to become obese. Its not okay"
"No way he&#39;s happy in his body. He feels like shit every single day, has trouble going to the bathroom, getting in and out of bed, basic things we all take for granted."
"The problem here is that (in the UK, where this was filmed) morbid obesity does hurt other people. We have public healthcare and it isn&#39;t very good. Every fat person who requires medical resources is taking those resources away from someone else who needs them.<br>IMO self-inflicted health conditions caused by things like obesity or smoking should not be covered by public healthcare."
I like your content but you talk too much. More of the clip needed before you analyse.
Disgusting more than anything
This girl is using this man living her best life
"&quot; Orange juice is pretty healthy &quot;<br>Depend on the frequency and quantity , even water can be deadly in absurde numbers of takes"
also &quot;i&#39;m not ashamed of being fat...but i&#39;m not going to tell you how much i weigh&quot; Thats the epitomy of shame
"I love piers Morgan, that is real news"
How did they get money for all of this food?
"Once again, Asmongold reminds us all what the Dunning-Kruger effect is. :D"
"I think the moment hes had kids, his obesity isnt only his personal problem anymore because obviously as a dad you are the primary role model for your kids. If you dont have shame about something thats so negativly impactful to you, weak people would give in easily. Im confident shame is a driving motivator for many people to NOT become fat, shame is good. I think on  the topic of mental health in this subject would simply be representative if you asked a formerly thin person gone fat, and a formerly fat person gone thin about how they feel about it and see whos gonna be most enthusiastic and inspirational speaking about their journey"
"Yeah, I knwo everything that was bad in the internet since 1999, all the shit that was flowing in 4chan and lime wire and torrents. you people don&#39;t know LOL"
"Let&#39;s make it clear, they&#39;re getting views cuz of his wife. Nothing else lol"
"I weigh 110kg and have been overweight for many years. I used to be slim, but my current belly has significantly reduced my quality of life both health-wise and in terms of self-esteem, especially around women. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. I believe those who defend this lifestyle are in denial, unable to see their own potential to make positive changes."
"My wife is a doctor. I can tell you that obese people cost everyone a lot. They require way more care, surgeries, prescriptions, and as such are part of why our insurance premiums are so high and our doctors are so stressed."
"such an L take on this, we already have wayy too much data to know its a bad idea. Just like smoking we put restrictions on it after over 50 years of data accumulated from hundreds of thousands of people. I mean yes leave them alone to being fat but to assume that the market will correct itself when the media is selective about what is censored and reported on.. its like &quot;hey casualties will happen unnecessarily because they have the freedom to hurt themselves&quot;. Change it from being obese to cutting yourself / blood letting like they did back in the day for whiter skin. Its just like of course its a bad idea. Which i dont think he denies but the way he seems to not only dismiss but to say leave them alone and celebrate their freedom to do it on a platform that they clearly accelerate the issue. His take like many others is a very self centric way of thinking versus the community way which is obviously how humans live in 2 simultaneous parallels."
"Thats not just fat, its full on rotund"

Says  Piers Morgan with his double chin...
On the topic for the shaming. Bro i got made fun of for having a spiderman lunchbox and for loving star wars and i was in the 5th grade elementary school. Complete bs
"people ofc should have the freedom to do what they want, but that doesnt mean its good. its objectively selfish for someone with kids to be that fat knowing they&#39;ll die young and leave their kids without a father.  its great when you can be age 80 and your mom and dad are still alive and healthy (as one can be) at age 100, and your kids are 60, their kids are 40, their kids are 20, their kids are newborns. its the whole concept of wanting to have kids when you&#39;re still young and healthy so you can go out and play football with them, go on hikes etc, and let them live most of their lives without the trauma of having dead parents. <br>being 15 and having your dad die of obesity is terrible."
"Holy shit he sounds exactly like James Corden<br><br>Also at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=688"">11:28</a> was she just about to say &quot;that the fat fucks&quot; lol<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=803"">13:23</a> &quot;bigger problem&quot; heh"

Being overweight and obese isn’t the same thing. One is not making weight for you specific age and height but can still be healthy( Over) and one is plain nasty(obese)
she seems out if it
95% failure rate for diets? lol She&#39;s delusional
Geez
I bet she spends as much on food in a week than I do in a month! I eat once a day.

Sad!
Sad that she&#39;s even agreed to an interview... it&#39;s embarrassing and pointless 🫣😔
5 years later and her IG is deplorable. It’s really sick. I wonder what happened that she treats her body and mind like this?
She is built like a tanker

Die.<br>And i feel like i can&#39;t really control it. Sure i could do a little more to improve my sleep but.. I am just saying i struggle..<br>I wouldNEVER go out there and say tha suffering with insomnia is fine and we should just accept it when someone is constantly tired.. This isn&#39;t normal.. There are many health issues related to insomnia, it scares me. And yet i don&#39;t see people glorifying it. It&#39;s different, sure but... It&#39;s an unhealthy thing too. Why is it fine to encourage unhealthy eating but not fineto encourage staying up for too long?<br>Why is this a thing?"
46???
Pierce is not obverweight at all she is dangetously overweight and could have jeart attack but why leave overweight people out of things because of how she looks but she didd try and take focus on him to take off her
"Oh… g<br>Go on a diet, it is like having cancer and denying chemotherapy"
Obesity is cursed simple
"Piers, you got mad at the British guy who wanted Russian women because of the obesity rate.  Don&#39;t get angry at him; why would he want to stay around for this?"
People are given a choice they can follow or not. I chose to check out of this fruitless debate
"The woman, as an adult, deserves respect in her decisions.<br><br>Conversely, accountability should rest with parents, the food industry, and marketing ethics for fostering obesity in children. Children lack agency in what they consume, and these influences can set lifelong patterns of unhealthy habits."
"I’m overweight - not quite as much as her but overweight nonetheless - but I can’t stand the hypocrisy of these ‘plus-size’ models, if they were stick-thin we’d rightly be calling it out for promoting unhealthy and unrealistic body image, but being hugely overweight is ok??"
She doesn&#39;t have to talk to know she&#39;s American!
A model for mobility scooters maybe 😂 lol cow
"Watch out for DR NOW, 600 lb life"
When GMB was good
You look 60
She does not understand that this is not about her.  Looking for ways to fight back with incoherent arguments only makes here look and sound naive
She’s deep in denial 😞
How can a lady go from &quot;My 600lb Sister&quot;  to a &quot;model?&quot; BA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is funny
"Piers, you are so spot on!<br>We really need you in Sweden! To be able to hear these thoughts we have to turn to s c &#39;alternative media&#39; - but without debate...<br><br>How dare you express what almost everyone thinks?😅<br><br>Love from Sweden!❤"
Piers looks good. This woman in red is a human tick.
Good to finally see a appearance sence your last one holding princess Leia captive in Star Wars
"Excuses,🙄 Go work out"
I cant believe it&#39;s not butter .
Trump 2024
Piers….220??? Sir add that 40lbs to your weight
She is dead 😂
"😂 emphasising the word BIG in that question, made my day"
"Well you are celebrating anorexic models, who are losing hair and teeth right? So what’s the difference"
"I watched a lot of guests here and this guest goes ad hominem. In the chess game of logic , this guest lost big time"
64.6 BMI is beyond crazy!!!
Is the cow still alive?
THE WORLD IS GOING BACK TO FRONT
&quot;model&quot; 😂😂😂
Piers has a beautiful  build very fit person she can&#39;t  reach for any thing else. Sad comment lady
A model for what? Dumper trucks?
So now barnyard cattles are called Models too ?
The eyebrows on the “Model” are a felony too!
I think she got hungry just from sitting there and having to talk more than she usually would. lol 😂
He’s 60 pounds over weight
One person is intelligent on this panel. Not either women.
The nerve this woman has is ... well huge.
In answer to his question about him reflecting a clinically dangerous weight. He is. Anything over weight is still clinically dangerous even if it is slightly. So yeah na he really can&#39;t talk
she is delusional making fun of not looking fun at all...BODY POSITIVITY MOVEMENT IS THE ONLY MOVEMENT THAT DOESNT REQUIRE TO MOVE
she really thought she <b>ate</b> after this
"Piers, if there are tv journalist like you , then anything is possible"
She likes eating what&#39;s the problem with that LOL
"I am judgemental against overweight people. Not proud of it, it&#39;s an automatic emotional reaction."
Diet has a 95 percent failure rate? Examples <br><br>She failed to put the box of doughnuts away<br>She failed to order a salad<br>She failed to choose water over soda<br>She failed to not over eat <br>She failed to take morning walks<br>She failed to pass on the butter
friendly fire isnt tolerated
Guys the girl coudnt make it up the stairs herself... Simple. piers is right lets face it
Nobody 600 lbs is a model for anything except donuts
Obesity = sickness
Jus&quot; buy a LARGE WIDE Angle Lens!
Moo 🐮
BIG backlash.  Who did she eat?
🐘🐘🐘🐘 borne as a 😮
I like piers
My phone screen is bent down to the right now
She said” I did it to get paid” 😂😂😂
Need Katie Hopkins on this pannel.
how the F can people be so lazy
Don&#39;t skinny people die of heart attack.
Get some help there’s too many options for weight loss and to be healthy is the quality of life that you live not longevity
&quot;Diets are 95% failure rate&quot;.  Yup that is why you don&#39;t diet.  You change your lifestyle.  Eating less calories than your daily requirement is medical science fact in losing weight.
"Bet if she walked down the street in that dress kids would be running behind her screaming &quot;HEY KOOL-ADE!!!   <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ssIfY7OFG5OykQOpn4CQCw""></a>"
Let’s face it… nobody WANTS to look like that <br>Literally nobody
"Everyone deserves love but think about it, you hardly ever seen obese elderly people. I think that says a lot."
"She is delusional!  Thank you, Piers."
His wife encourages it. She likes him that big. It’s a sexual fetish.
"As an obese woman with walking issues due to car accidents without medical because ex was drunk, it is hard to lose weulight and i think its disgusting to glorify obesity. Its hard it hurts"
They are raking in ten thousand pounds a month so it is all about the money.
Does Piers Morgan ever get through an interview without talking across people and not letting other people finish their sentences?
I feel I’m either 100% with piers Morgan or 100% against him. This time I’m 100% with him
blair looks like she did one of those uncanny makeup trends
That’s his wife???!!! 😮🤨🧐
Piers Morgan should invited nick avocado to the show
Margot Squares
I used to like sweets!
&quot;plus size&quot;.. its called fat
Fatty
Jackson Sarah Young Jeffrey Walker Jennifer
Went to a party<br>I ate all night<br>I ate sixteen hamburgers <br>And I started up a fight<br>But now I am jaded<br>You&#39;re out of luck<br>I&#39;m rolling down the stairs<br>Too fat to work…….
Weak men are dangerous
How is he a father............must have one humungous penii
"Being happy in one&#39;s skin, is not the same as flouting being out of shape.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s doing that.  He&#39;s just being happy and himself.  If he could lose weight, I&#39;m sure he would.  We don&#39;t anyone regarding of whether we agree w/ their state of being, to be unhappy in their own skin."
No way missionary goes on in that bedroom
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iPqwf01s64&amp;t=382"">6:22</a> theirs that insecurity I knew was there. He projects it on to his wife. Got it 👍🏾"
Well someone&#39;s punching above his weight...😮😮
Is funny the person that have debating how all that surgery on her face
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iPqwf01s64&amp;t=48"">0:48</a> &quot;Really? That&#39;s what people are watching?&quot; My thoughts exactly."
The fact that he is promoting obesity is shocking I was near 20 stone and had a shock at the doctors and within a year I have dropped over 4 stone by completely Changing my diet and walking more if he feels happy in his own skin fair enough that&#39;s up to him but promoting junk food and bad diets aren&#39;t right I have been down the same road I was living of junk food takeouts dinners enough to feed 2 people plus dessert afterwards only going to work and home nothing in-between days of work all i done was eat all day and I know it&#39;s hard to change but it just takes something to click now im eating 3 times a day and haven&#39;t had any takeouts apart from when I&#39;m in Spain in over a year if your happy in your own body fair enough but don&#39;t promote bad diets or junk food
Internet has killed most things
Genetics 🤣
Well done Piers
"If you google old fat people and hit images, not too many pictures show up. That says it all."
Why
"I liked piers but lately he is just being rude,always right  and just generally a 😂"
Why would they bring in some random trans dude to talk about this lol who cares
"This interview was badly handled, Piers could have allowed the man to speak more rather than talking over him and doing too much"
That Blaire White person has a Michael Jackson nose replica on her face. <br>What&#39;s going on in the world Lol
Maybe he can rent himself out as a  blimp character in the Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Parade. Or have &#39;GOODYEAR&quot; painted on his side so he can float over the Rose Bowl on New Year&#39;s Day.
that thing had babies with that lady ?
"People choose themselves what they put in their body, like if you seen a crackhead promoting crack, you wouldn&#39;t start taking crack, leave this guy alone ffs"
"What&#39;s funny is that there have been actual studies that have been done that show when you work out your body releases endorphins which is basically a dopamine rush, making you feel good. It doesn&#39;t make sense to not workout."
His wife is so cute people say you need to stay lean and muscular to get girls n look at him😂
Holy cow
"Why not promote healthy eating, show how to eat sensibly, exercise regularly"
They better leave my girl Abby out of this- not that it should matter but her account is now being used to document her weightloss journey
Blair White is very beautiful even though it cost a lot of money to get there!
lol she won’t stay with him for long
His wife is kinda bad
This is why aliens don&#39;t visit us....
"I agree with Piers, but if he’s not even going to let him speak, then he shouldn’t invite him on his show."
I think I&#39;m moving to the UK we&#39;re truth and facts are aloud
Start your day with some brain
That&#39;s his wife...? She&#39;s gotta be mental.
I&#39;m here one year later but I doubt the Fatvocate -fat advocate is.
The bigger you get. The more your heart works.
craig
fat and obese are not the same
Thats why glutonny became a sin.
"OK, so as anybody ever heard of the dangers of botox? 🤣 She&#39;s there talking about the dangers of obesity."
She came for the fame and stayed for the life insurance.
He just influenced me to go to the gym
Why would you record yourself eating a Reese&#39;s peanut butter cup? People are weird af
The one time I agree with Pierce.
"Hey fatty bom bom, chill out on those cheese burgers and you might be able to spend some of that money and be with your family"
Piers should have Nikokado Avocado on his show
He must earn some serious coin if he&#39;s able to pull that bird
What a pointless segment. That was just inviting some dude on to berate him and his wife about his weight.
Nothing like being a big pile of s*** and trying to make it look cool as an influencer
"Denying the actual definition of what you are is part of the whole problem, you are denying you have a problem. &quot;Well, let&#39;s not call it..... &lt;insert every adjective that describes you to a T.&gt;&quot;<br>Also, pretty sure his gf has a fat fetish."
"I mean.. Piers is also fat and he was eating burgers on his program with celebration, so I find it funny that he is the one to say what is healthy and what is not."
The look in his wife’s eyes you can see she is waiting for him to choke on a donut
Reject modernity.  Embrace masculinity
the american done my head in dissing george but shes got thousands worth of cosmetics on her face
425
"the wife is a feeder, she will feed him till she klills him and then move on"
His favorite band must be OB/CD
His wife is like Jill Biden. Complicit
Over 30 stone
At least George is a real person unlike Blaire. She looked like a doll with her plastered on make up and her lipstick placed higher than her upper lip. Give me real people like George and not these fakes.
One of the rare occasions where I totally agree with Piers.
"This was such a misfire, both Piers and Blaire (wild choice for a guest btw) and all the comments are just talking around this guy purely because of his weight. <br><br>He clearly said he’s not proud of his weight, he wouldn’t recommend for anyone to gain weight like he did, that he appreciates the health risks and that there is an issue with obesity in the UK, and that he’s currently working to lose weight!! <br><br>His videos are for fun and (now) money. He’s literally making fun of himself in his videos. <br><br>Why is everyone talking like this is a body positivity activist! He’s trying to lose weight, the body positivity cult would crucify him! <br><br>It was like Piers wasn’t even interviewing the person in front of him, he wasn’t listening at all. They literally said he was working on losing weight and Piers not long after says “why don’t you go on a fitness/weight loss journey and show that?” ????"
Those food tic toks gave me ptsd discusting
"These people just benefit of the age we live in, even thought none of it is thanks to them... If it were just 1000 or even a 100 years ago, they&#39;d be the first one to go. There&#39;s no place in nature for this, natural selection would deal with those very very quickly"
"Nothing funny about it, he is in total denial 😂"
108.9 on your dial!
"Well most Trump supporters fall into the obese category.  I know, because I’ve been to 3 of his rallies.   🤷🏻"
Is that craig from ppl just do nothing
His wife is fine 👌 But he’s 🤮 🤮
Interesting topic. I just wish Pierre’s didn’t constantly talk over guests like he does in this video
Fat influencers should not be allowed to be around children
Is that Harvey&#39;s dad? (Katie Price)
One of George’s influencers insulted me for being slim.
"Private health care doesn’t cover A&amp;E or ambulances, or intensive care of any form. <br><br>Nice try, but you can’t use that to get off the hook. And in all fairness, there’s a high chance you’ll use all 3 as you’re one breath away from a heart attack or stroke….."
"Planet Earth is done, doomed and finished."
Its just immature hes in his late 30s just grow up and get a proper job 😂😂
"its a spit in the face for people like me with psoriasis (which can&#39;t be cured), who has occasional flare ups, that these obese people wanna share this body positivity movement with people who actually have unfixable circumstances"
Pounds in excess pounds 😂😂😂 that one got me😂😂
Piers is honestly being so disrespectful but he usually is. I agree with some of what he’s saying but the way he’s communicating is going to make people not want to do anything. They may even do the opposite in spite of his rude comments
There’s no way that’s his wife bro she’s way too hot for him
They make money getting fat and then they make money losing weight. Come on people. Contribute to the f ing world.
he makes piers morgan look thin
"Just clicked on the video to say it&#39;s unfair to show the frame of the obese man on a wider frame than that of piers. May not have been intentional but it shows so much meaning of the two. A lack of balance, such as the conversation and showcasing more of the body of the man in doing so. Piers is not a healthy looking man either, and to shoot both subjects this way is already putting in a negative impression. Bad journalism."
As said by the slim and slender piers morgan 😭🤣
Heart attack doesn’t care about you body positively! Diabetes doesn’t care about that!
Im more stunned that he got a girl like that and had a kid with her.....clearly money talks
Feel bad for that girl dude probably stunk
The bad effect of obesity on the body is too much consequence in having the same lifestyle as him well I guess he is earning money and he is living a yolo life
Blaire has no right to talk with that plastic face.
If you can be so easily be influenced by someone then you must be weak minded to begin with.
fat people should pay more.....insurance as well
How is paying for an Xtra seat raising them prices for others? Here he goes again running his mouth while clueless.
It&#39;s not as bad as an overweight woman trying to give me diet advice and telling me I need to be eating vegetables (I love vegetables so I don&#39;t need to be encouraged) But she was completely unaware that she was bigger than I am. I&#39;m not that big. I didn&#39;t ask her for advice! But people are always trying to analyze things that don&#39;t involve them at all and they know nothing about.
No discrimination.  Get your head out of the chicken bucket.  I&#39;m a big man 6&#39;5&quot; 285 lbs.  I fly either business or first class.  I don&#39;t whine about it.
"When it pertains to women, this is what *I think*:
<br>
<br>*Thicc*: female proportions and the curves are a bit more exagerated/bodyfat-augmented than average.
<br>*Fat*: You have a BMI of &gt; 29 and a fat percentage of &gt;30% and most importantly out of proportion
<br>*Plus-size*: All your features (incl muscles, joints, etc) are bigger than average, but you still see the female silhouette because of good fat distribution
<br>*Big*: fat
<br>*Plump*:  average fat% but BMI &gt;27 and lacking proportion
<br>*chubby*: plus-size but petite
<br>*curvy*: plus-size or thicc
<br>
<br>Fat is the only one here <b>I think</b> is objectively unhealthy and mostly unattractive"
Kids have become ultimate brats!
She needs too use boat travel they can accommodate 😅
No how about losing some weight so you can fit into one seat and not be a safety hazard to everyone on your flight.
It’s all effin ridiculous.
Children and young people are so thin skinned nowadays.
"confused, if you&#39;re offended she said &quot;girls&quot; then you should be offended by calling a school a &quot;girls&quot; school? HYPOCRISY"
"Sitting next to an oversized whale makes me lose my dignity! What an a$$, and a gigantic one, at that!"
"I never thought I&#39;d live to see one that washed up so far inland. 😧 Life Lesson: If you don&#39;t want to attract mockery, don&#39;t try to push your delusions on others."
"All plus sized people should be given absolutely no benefits or special treatment for being fat whatsoever, in fact, ban them from all flights."
The time is coming when the label &quot;racist&quot; will be something to be proud of.I am proud to carry that label.
"Plus size 😂 How is that nicer than just saying fat? Or, more accurately,  morbidly obese."
"I mostly arrive last in most areas , but I try not to bug people about it."
Too bad…. Go on a diet. I’m skinny maybe I should get half off huh
well we werent the one making her plus size.
Today&#39;s generation is challenging reality itself
Then LOOSE weight‼️‼️
Tall people don’t get more leg room unless they buy a business or first-class seat. They can’t change their height. FAT people CAN work on changing their weight.
if she doesn&#39;t identify as a girl she/he/it should be banned from ONLY girls school....
That&#39;s why airplanes have cargo  area 😅😅
"Why call them Plus Size?  Just say Fat, that’s what they are"
But where does Piers find these obnoxious people who can&#39;t differentiate between reality and stupidity? And that woman should not travel in Airplanes and even if she does then she should check in as luggage and not passenger
"I’m the first to agree that airplane seats are too small. But until or unless that is ever resolved, instead of being entitled, maybe have some compassion for the person who is being squished up next to you?"
"That happened to my sons bus driver once. He would get to the school and dismiss the “ladies first” and then the boys. Of course, you had to have that one student make a stink over it and the bus driver got in trouble over it."
It is the first time I agree with him 100%.
Ahh Diabetty<br><br>Run or she&#39;ll eat your babies
Slob.
"Dear lord. They have to pump an extra ton of fuel into the plane to carry those land-whales so they already add 1.5 tons to the plane. Girl, ...there are physical limits. They are only two or three all-you-can-eat buffets away from needing a C5-Galaxy. What will happen then? A petition for a second transport rack?"
The world has gone bananas!  This generation has no respect for authority.  All thin non-binary is rubbish!   Teachers these days have no rights.  STFU <del>-Love Piers Morgan--</del>
The select few…are the few members of fat acceptance who are still alive… not the ones of average size.
Perhaps the airlines should provide accommodations on their freighters  for these entitled buffalo gals.
Agree
Can’t argue with stupidity .
Well she must always get double at McDonald’s .
When did being a girl or woman become a dirty word
If people have to pay extra for heavy luggage then obese people should do the same thing
"I can remember a time when people flew they dressed properly they behaved themselves and if someone behaved badly they were shocked and horrified, today people act like they don&#39;t have a single living brain cell."
How did the teacher know the girl identified as a boy ffs
Its just pathetic
"Im surprised she is allowed to travel on regular planes, she should go on cargo!"
"Love the university clip, gives me hope"
Billy o Reilly has let himself go
When I send air cargo I pay by the kg - why should that girl that likes eating not be treated as cargo
Naah you should pay extra
Rancors go in the hold
LIBBY WOMAN
"LOL this is exactly what happens when people are allowed access to the internet, the delusion is they think it gives them authority or entitlement. I wish I&#39;d studied sociology at school. Because cognitively people are seriously struggling with sanity and it&#39;s having a detrimental effect on society."
She recommends concrete steps bc that’s all that can support her😂
Obesity is not the airlines fault it’s yours
So the fat girl gets extra seats. I bet she’ll say something like skinny people should share seats
There are those planes that crate up hippopotamus’ to move them around. She should use that.
"The name, plus size , gives relief for pigs, to being pigs."
"I wanted go to journalist school, then I was educated. I got a butt lift, Botox, and transcranial  magnetic stimulation. Now I don’t offend anyone. It’s a thing."
Thought ‘fly’ meant beautiful. Going to stay home.
I want to know where his plug goes
He wants to know where man tampons go.
How about a nice seat in the cargo area.
US Universities have lost their quality and credibility
One word: salad
"Just as your carry on luggage has to fit certain dimensions your body should also fit in the seat without spill over and discomfort to other fliers.  If this woman is too large for the seat then put this woman, and her luggage, on a cargo flight and charge her fare by the pound.  I am tired of people who can&#39;t live by the rules demanding special treatment."
The first one was wild
Lose weight
Everybody is entitled to dignity and respect.<br>But not two seats for the price of one.<br>America has been socially assaulted by the left for years now. We are a tolerant people and have done our best to accommodate various segments of society that are out of the norm.<br>This tolerance has served to enable the extremists. And America&#39;s moderates have had enough. November&#39;s presidential election will serve to show less about Trump and more a horrified disenfranchisement with Biden.
Lose weight 😅
I’m a fat guy and I couldn’t agree more! Over the last six years I’ve lost 150 pounds. Before I lost weight I bought two seats on a plane. My fat. My cost.
Dont be PLUS sizef then
Ummmm…so airlines should install sofas for fat girls???
She&#39;s so healthy that she needs oxygen and can&#39;t even walk down the length of a plane without a wheelchair
"I&#39;d never support that petition. Obese people should pay double. They cause more fuel consumption, thus more pollution etc. Etc."
she looks like an massively over wieght brett cooper
This whole „The majority has to conform to the minority.“ will never work. It‘s an unsustainable fad.
Whenever someone screams „Your racism is showing.“ I have to laugh.
I feel sorry for the passengers next to the lady
"Make sure the travel industry serves everyone not just a select few? Your part of the select few they have to go so far out of their way for, cus you can&#39;t walk to airport gates, can&#39;t carry luggage, can&#39;t sit in a normal seat, probably can&#39;t sleep in standard hotel beds, can&#39;t sit in any sort of hot weather, can go on any excursions without assistance and special measures. <br><br>Yet you have the gaul to demand more."
&#39;Mr Bo&#39;sun; pass me my largest harpoon!&#39;
"&quot;SHE WAS THE SIZE OF THE PLANE THAT SHE WANTED TO FLY&quot; I&#39;m dead, this word is amazing. Thank you"
I identify as a fridge.<br>Full of beer. 😜
Put the happy meals down.
"Being unhealthy and proud isnt a reason to be unhealthy. Youre ashamed of yourself and are grasping at straws to feel validated because you&#39;re unwilling to change. <br>This includes trans - if youre unwilling to change, to realize that how you feel isnt a moral justification to change the definition of what a woman is nor to force irresponsible opinions on the rest of society. Lgbtq+++++ is just becoming an excuse to wave your hand and be however you wanna be. Male rapist to women tofay, identifies as a woman tomorrow, can use womans restrooms and lockers.<br>Children? Its confusing af for everyone forming an identity as it is, now you wanna add a total disregard of social and moral standards? Lmao wow.<br>Tomorrow im gonna identify as your aunt."
Pierce: Because you’re a Beast<br><br>Me: you just proved their point of bullying.
High demand anybody with obesity to lose the weight and stop telling other to accept them for being fat.fst is a unhealthy State for the body why should we have to accept it
Do we need larger exit rows are I doubt she would get out.
Waiting for the “we need a larger luggage allowance because our clothes are bigger”
I do not want to sit next to you.
"“Plus size”- typical obfuscating euphemism.<br>Medical term is : morbidly obese. <br>Eat less, weigh less. Eat more, buy two tickets. Accountability for one’s actions is good for one’s mental health."
&quot; PLUS SIZE &quot; Means Porker!
Kevin is the problem and definitely not part of the solution…
Love your work Piers…
The woman is grotesque with a total lack of self control.
They need more seats? What they need to do is lose weight.
At least this woman never hacked a murder victims phone.
Ever notice that really obese people have a permanent frown on both  sides of their mouths? Lol i only see it on fat people
Piers Morgan is &quot;ludicrous.&quot;
I think she might require the whole plane to herself -- which sounds completely fair to me.  My concern would be that she might eat the plane -- and the entire crew -- before they have a chance to do their jobs.
Airline seats should generally be bigger.
"Who cares, whatever happened to individualism"
"Shame has value when it comes from within, you dont need more from the outside. The argument that smoking is also bad or &quot;other stuff is bad too&quot; isnt an argument, you should try to be healthy where you find it worth while since being 100% perfect is impossible. Glorification of morbid obesity should not be allowed, just as we dont allow people to glorify drugs or gambling, obviously. Insane to me people have this &quot;i can do whatever i want because its my body&quot; mentality when you have children who depend and rely on you, absolute nonsense of people just justifying what they do because they dont want to think of actual consequences. I think these messages like that prey on people in vulnerable states who are looking for any reason to keep doing what they are doing instead of getting the possible help for the underlying problems they have."
The thing is peirs is asking a man who is pretending to be a woman if being fat is wrong <br>It&#39;s not something that makes sense
"cmon we all know there&#39;re a lot of people who have fat-fetish to be fair, it take like 1/4 to 1/3 out of all the rule 34 gallery including super fat characters, especially fat furries"
I hate tv interviews because its literally just <br>&quot;Im great and right!&quot; <br>&quot;No you&#39;re wrong!&quot; <br>&quot;Blahblahblahnouourewronginrightaaaa-&quot; <br>&quot;Sorry we&#39;re out of time goodbye!!!&quot;
"Coming from someone who was 140lbs over weight, it&#39;s horrible to be that big, and there&#39;s nothing glorious about it. Get off your lazy ass, quit shoveling food down your throat,  and change your life!  I was fat shamed and it was a good thing! I appreciate it!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=360"">6:00</a> - And then there&#39;s furry pron and you&#39;re really not ready for that."
"Ah come on guys healthy food is cheaper than fast food and it&#39;s cheaper than THAT AMOUNT of food regardless.<br>Just buy groceries and cook. If your standard for food are delivery apps, then yeah, &quot;healthy&quot; is more expensive."
"Guys, I&#39;ve figured it out. It&#39;s not a fat people fetish, it&#39;s a tactic to speed run inheritance."
The fact that this man managed to make a 21 minute reaction video out of a 7 minute video is insane lmfaoo
Saw the thumbnail on this old video and my first thought was is this guy still alive?
The “meta” for a fat man having an attractive girlfriend or wife is if he has money. That isn’t new or unique. Women mostly just care about money so being fat is nearly inconsequential.
(I do agree on your take with alcohol... this country has a load of alcoholics)
"Correction AsNoitall:  it is NOT a God given right to be obese.  It&#39;s a intentional &quot;devil may care&quot; cause in harming your own body, that God gave you, leading to induced health issues and death.  This IS NOT a God given right.  Killing yourself slowly over-eating foods, and then making a big joke of it.  The wife could care less of the health risk to her husband... as long as she&#39; getting free air-time on TikTok.  It&#39;s a free will choice, yes, but with all the fucked-up people out there, he&#39;s sending the wrong signals or impressions to being fat.  And to that, God does not look kindly on.  You are accountable to God first and for most...."
Let’s do it ? Ok! ✅
"Why do people say eating healthy is expensive, its way cheaper. Even if it wasn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t buying less food, and eating healthy be cheaper."
From all the bad shit you can see and learn from the internet.. there will always be more..
When culture is based on corporate needs.
In my country there is no single unhealthy thing that cost less than healthy food

&quot;Let&#39;s do it&quot;. I&#39;m dying over here😂
Jeez how much work did he get done to look like that?
Also any rational person knows how much he weighs pretty accurately without him saying. Someone of that size is about 700 pounds.
This is just fucking ridiculous at this point some people are fat because the worst type of food for you is the cheapest option growing up keeping fresh fruit and vegies wasn’t cheap for a snack but it was easier to buy a bag of chips and because ur a kid and u don’t know how to tell ur self no so u eat till ur full and then u put the bag of chips away then a few hours later mama makes dinner and u eat till ur full again its not that parents encourage bad eating habits its just i didn’t know how badly my habbits were untill i put some weight on shit happens u can’t say fat is unhealthy because fat is normal its apart of animal kingdom we get fat to hibernate it just extra food storage just loads of people now don’t need a diet they need to fast
"Typical store bought Orange juice isnt much different than Coke really, to be fair."

"you can always bend facts with statistics, In 2022, approximately 3.6 million people were treated in emergency departments for injuries involving sports and recreational equipment. In 2021, exercise equipment-related injuries resulted in 40,485 fatalities. you can argue going to the gym is bad. 🤣🤣"
Oh no.  His chick is into it.
Make soft drink and  potato ship aisles in supermarket thin so only skinny people can buy that shit.
If I’m not mistaken I think he has died since this….
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=217"">3:37</a> There he is. In the fat… I mean flesh."
Anatole never fails to prove me right
"For tens of thousands of years humans had to work very hard to acquire food. For the majority of our existence we broke even in terms of energy gain vs energy expense with food. The gain was slightly more give the fact that we&#39;re still around, obviously. <br>It&#39;s only for the last couple of decades where food has become so widespread available in extreme abundance, topped off with a capitalistic system who&#39;s single purpose it is to sell the consumer as much as possible, and you got the perfect recipe for a global obesity epidemic. <br>Human&#39;s are literally gorging themselves to death as a result of our own success. We&#39;re not cognitively wired to resist our urges to eat, it&#39;s a result of thousands of years of habit and evolution. What we can do however is become consciously aware of this phenomenon and teach our kids how to responsibly handle food. Which is the exact opposite of body positivity"
Have you ever seen a 300 pound 70 year old? Food for thought. Pun intended.
Thumbnail makes him look like a Hollow Knight boss...
"Satan has won the last 4 million rounds,  and the last 100 were by K.O. 😈"
"&quot;growing up in poverty&quot; last i checked it doesnt cost money to do idk, jogging, or pull ups on PUBLIC (free) street fitnesses etc. she is obv coping with the fact that she is gonna be a single mother in the next few years and will 100% tell to her kid not to repeat the same mistakes. If anything growing up in poverty should result in you being skinnier"
"He is hurting other people by doing this though, not only is he encouraging others to be obese, he&#39;s putting a burden on the nhs a system that everyone pays for."
"I find it funny, being a fat man myself, is that all those people are the ones ranting on twitter asking for freedom of speech, freedom of whatever, but when it comes to something they disagree, they are all against it. Fat people, gay people, what ever.. so it&#39;s freedom of speech as long as you agree with it. LoL.<br>Cmon, let people be fat, gay, bi, whatever, what others do have zero influence on my life."
"Seriously. I dont think its that bad. Most of them die before 50/60 but still pay taxes and contribute to society. If someone has data and statistics that show that most of them dont work because of health issues I will retract this, but these 350 plus pound cases are of the rarer kind, at least in my country.  Most of them are 220-300. They can walk and work, just no sports etc."

Gluttony has consequences - who would have thought?
"You don&#39;t have to know all of the fetish metas to know that if you can imagine it, there&#39;s a meta for it 😅"
What if it was about anorexia ?
Have them watch the movie &quot;the whale&quot;
Since they are influencing many others to be obese that is why it costs the country so much money. they may have private healthcare but the people they influence to do this lifestyle do not so essentially they do contribute to that cost
"FYI orange juice is worst than a coca cola, the sugar is the worst you can eat, and to drink this at breakfirst is killing your estomac."
My uncle is a truck driver the donkey show isn’t just an old thing the odds of him telling me this story yesterday then this popping up is funny as hell
Sayin that someone who lives until 50&#39;s and die of obesity costs more than someone who lives healthy until thei 90&#39;s are insane.
"How that guy is living his life is no one&#39;s business. He&#39;s getting a lot of money from his videos, I&#39;m sure the ones complaining about him are the ones watching those videos."
&quot;death cult&quot; is the best definition I&#39;ve ever heard for the fat positivity movement.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=655"">10:55</a>"
"ALSO, IT&#39;S REALLY SAD HOW MONEY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HIS HEALTH."
IMAGINE BEING A BLOB THAT JUST EXISTS TO EXIST.
lol Asmon doesn’t now anything about nutrition 🤣🤣🤣
Should be mandatpry for health insurance to be 2-3x as expensive for people who are over 2-3x the normal weight.
His wife is a good lookin lady... she&#39;ll out last him and have great prospects and maybe a little money when he passes
"I&#39;ve worked at nursing homes. It&#39;s 80% old people, 10% young morbidly obese, 5% crippled by accident 5% cancer and dying. <br>The young obese are the hardest (physically) to take care of. When you&#39;re too fat for a hoyer lift, legs leaking with lymphedema and won&#39;t even help turn yourself you break the backs of the people tasked to care for you. It&#39;s unfair and robs the elderly of time for caregivers."
Obesity is gross
Bros gonna influence for a couple years until he dies…. So it can’t be that big of a deal LOL bros got another couple years to go until his heart fails
Americans need to return to Jesus Christ.
Absolutely it should be allowed!…..fucking you are hilarious and I love you!!
I love Blair White
Fatfluencers?!
Sad
How do they afford this lifestyle
14 mins in I couldn’t disagree more mate. Unless you were raised in poor Britain in the 90s you have no idea how little we knew about nutrition. Knowbody cared. I didn’t know fruit has sugar till I started a kitchen job at 16. My grandparents used to give us sugar sandwiches if we were hungry cause it tasted like cake and no one could afford cakes. This is real life bro. I’m now 33 and go to great lengths just to maintain a chubby physique and not of over the deep end. I will forever have issues around food now because of that time. That’s why schools try so hard now to teach about healthy eating. Also when I was a kid sugar was in no way a bad thing. Fat was the enemy in all forms.
"Literally the only thing a man should and must eat, is pure natural meat. Veggies and fruits are just a gmo hoax..... People eat this crap since the end of 1940&#39;s event. Back in history this was &quot;food&quot; for slaves to keep them weak but yet alive to do the work they were suppose to do. Meat was only for the strong and rich."
"I agree that people should be allowed to do whatever as long as it doesnt hurt others. HOWEVER, this is harmful. It gives the impression that being morbidly obese is fun and you will be happy. It encourages people to not eat healthy or work out and to become obese. Its not okay"
"No way he&#39;s happy in his body. He feels like shit every single day, has trouble going to the bathroom, getting in and out of bed, basic things we all take for granted."
"The problem here is that (in the UK, where this was filmed) morbid obesity does hurt other people. We have public healthcare and it isn&#39;t very good. Every fat person who requires medical resources is taking those resources away from someone else who needs them.<br>IMO self-inflicted health conditions caused by things like obesity or smoking should not be covered by public healthcare."
I like your content but you talk too much. More of the clip needed before you analyse.
Disgusting more than anything
This girl is using this man living her best life
"&quot; Orange juice is pretty healthy &quot;<br>Depend on the frequency and quantity , even water can be deadly in absurde numbers of takes"
also &quot;i&#39;m not ashamed of being fat...but i&#39;m not going to tell you how much i weigh&quot; Thats the epitomy of shame
"I love piers Morgan, that is real news"
How did they get money for all of this food?
"Once again, Asmongold reminds us all what the Dunning-Kruger effect is. :D"
"I think the moment hes had kids, his obesity isnt only his personal problem anymore because obviously as a dad you are the primary role model for your kids. If you dont have shame about something thats so negativly impactful to you, weak people would give in easily. Im confident shame is a driving motivator for many people to NOT become fat, shame is good. I think on  the topic of mental health in this subject would simply be representative if you asked a formerly thin person gone fat, and a formerly fat person gone thin about how they feel about it and see whos gonna be most enthusiastic and inspirational speaking about their journey"
"Yeah, I knwo everything that was bad in the internet since 1999, all the shit that was flowing in 4chan and lime wire and torrents. you people don&#39;t know LOL"
"Let&#39;s make it clear, they&#39;re getting views cuz of his wife. Nothing else lol"
"I weigh 110kg and have been overweight for many years. I used to be slim, but my current belly has significantly reduced my quality of life both health-wise and in terms of self-esteem, especially around women. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. I believe those who defend this lifestyle are in denial, unable to see their own potential to make positive changes."
"My wife is a doctor. I can tell you that obese people cost everyone a lot. They require way more care, surgeries, prescriptions, and as such are part of why our insurance premiums are so high and our doctors are so stressed."
"such an L take on this, we already have wayy too much data to know its a bad idea. Just like smoking we put restrictions on it after over 50 years of data accumulated from hundreds of thousands of people. I mean yes leave them alone to being fat but to assume that the market will correct itself when the media is selective about what is censored and reported on.. its like &quot;hey casualties will happen unnecessarily because they have the freedom to hurt themselves&quot;. Change it from being obese to cutting yourself / blood letting like they did back in the day for whiter skin. Its just like of course its a bad idea. Which i dont think he denies but the way he seems to not only dismiss but to say leave them alone and celebrate their freedom to do it on a platform that they clearly accelerate the issue. His take like many others is a very self centric way of thinking versus the community way which is obviously how humans live in 2 simultaneous parallels."
"Thats not just fat, its full on rotund"
"she is 100% cheating on him, I bet u they dont have DNA test about if he is the Real Dad of the child."
"Amongold only got on the internet in grade 4 or 5? Dammn, my dad was in tech, and we had two phone lines, one for dial-up. I started using a PC at 5 years old and first time I remember connecting to the net I was 6 or 7 (1997/98) had my own PC by the time I was 8...<br>I&#39;ve seen some shit."
Says  Piers Morgan with his double chin...
On the topic for the shaming. Bro i got made fun of for having a spiderman lunchbox and for loving star wars and i was in the 5th grade elementary school. Complete bs
"people ofc should have the freedom to do what they want, but that doesnt mean its good. its objectively selfish for someone with kids to be that fat knowing they&#39;ll die young and leave their kids without a father.  its great when you can be age 80 and your mom and dad are still alive and healthy (as one can be) at age 100, and your kids are 60, their kids are 40, their kids are 20, their kids are newborns. its the whole concept of wanting to have kids when you&#39;re still young and healthy so you can go out and play football with them, go on hikes etc, and let them live most of their lives without the trauma of having dead parents. <br>being 15 and having your dad die of obesity is terrible."
"Holy shit he sounds exactly like James Corden<br><br>Also at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=688"">11:28</a> was she just about to say &quot;that the fat fucks&quot; lol<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=803"">13:23</a> &quot;bigger problem&quot; heh"
All she want is his life insurance. lol
Surprising that most people don’t realize Zack’s been playing one of the most degenerate games out there for YEARS and learned all this madman’s knowledge through the player base 💀
"They are making a lot of money, and when he dies from health problems. Its all her money."
"That&#39;s only noon too🤣🤣🤣<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=106"">1:46</a>."
"I&#39;m 46, if I die tomorrow that&#39;s ok. That is really sad........"
is she still alive?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxGEJqLEk2c&amp;t=420"">7:00</a> Learned helplessness meets a defeatist attitude meets a self fulfilling prophecy."
She says she is younger than him like that&#39;s a brag
64 bmi....holy...moly....sick...sick...
Being overweight and obese isn’t the same thing. One is not making weight for you specific age and height but can still be healthy( Over) and one is plain nasty(obese)
she seems out if it
95% failure rate for diets? lol She&#39;s delusional
Geez
I bet she spends as much on food in a week than I do in a month! I eat once a day.
his co host is so brainless lol
Who saw the elephant in the room.🦣🐘
Doesn&#39;t the fashion industry celebrate anorexia?!
Life isn&#39;t fair &amp; isn&#39;t suppose to be

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxGEJqLEk2c&amp;t=186"">3:06</a> sh’s so rude"
i have a pet pig for mein own amusement
Let this woman be…. Unfortunately she won’t survive to see 60 😢
"Angelina, can you take over the healthcare insurance companies 😂"
"Change the healthcare system pierce , get a clue , please 😊"
"Yes , I think it’s wonderful  she’s on tv , she’s fine , let’s take the healthcare companies who know with dna manipulation, everyone can live a healthy weight and help them change the system to help this young actress, not tell her our healthcare system is a massive joke in the ununited  states , cause we’ve known that forever 😊"
Chloe also has pumped up lips which look ridiculous… natural is best.
"We once had a patient similar to her size requiring us to ship her to nearby Zoo for CT scan because the patient can&#39;t fit into CT scanner.<br>They do have higher risk of dying, but that&#39;s their call if they want to die."
Couch cushion
Sad!
Sad that she&#39;s even agreed to an interview... it&#39;s embarrassing and pointless 🫣😔
5 years later and her IG is deplorable. It’s really sick. I wonder what happened that she treats her body and mind like this?
She is built like a tanker
People need to STOP ENCOURAGING MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH ISSUES JUST TO MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL BETTER. IT&#39;S P*****G ME OFF
I watched The whale last night... Just sayin...
Moo
What music video was she in
"I have been suffering from insomnia pretty much as long as i can remember..<br>I am 25, i like to workout but.. I can see how lack of sleep is really starting to effect me.<br>Sometimes it even causes panic attacks. They are mild but... They make me feel like i just might randomly.. Die.<br>And i feel like i can&#39;t really control it. Sure i could do a little more to improve my sleep but.. I am just saying i struggle..<br>I wouldNEVER go out there and say tha suffering with insomnia is fine and we should just accept it when someone is constantly tired.. This isn&#39;t normal.. There are many health issues related to insomnia, it scares me. And yet i don&#39;t see people glorifying it. It&#39;s different, sure but... It&#39;s an unhealthy thing too. Why is it fine to encourage unhealthy eating but not fineto encourage staying up for too long?<br>Why is this a thing?"
46???
Pierce is not obverweight at all she is dangetously overweight and could have jeart attack but why leave overweight people out of things because of how she looks but she didd try and take focus on him to take off her
"Oh… g<br>Go on a diet, it is like having cancer and denying chemotherapy"
Obesity is cursed simple
"Piers, you got mad at the British guy who wanted Russian women because of the obesity rate.  Don&#39;t get angry at him; why would he want to stay around for this?"
People are given a choice they can follow or not. I chose to check out of this fruitless debate
"The woman, as an adult, deserves respect in her decisions.<br><br>Conversely, accountability should rest with parents, the food industry, and marketing ethics for fostering obesity in children. Children lack agency in what they consume, and these influences can set lifelong patterns of unhealthy habits."
"I’m overweight - not quite as much as her but overweight nonetheless - but I can’t stand the hypocrisy of these ‘plus-size’ models, if they were stick-thin we’d rightly be calling it out for promoting unhealthy and unrealistic body image, but being hugely overweight is ok??"
She doesn&#39;t have to talk to know she&#39;s American!
A model for mobility scooters maybe 😂 lol cow
"Watch out for DR NOW, 600 lb life"
When GMB was good
You look 60
She does not understand that this is not about her.  Looking for ways to fight back with incoherent arguments only makes here look and sound naive
She’s deep in denial 😞
How can a lady go from &quot;My 600lb Sister&quot;  to a &quot;model?&quot; BA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is funny
"Piers, you are so spot on!<br>We really need you in Sweden! To be able to hear these thoughts we have to turn to s c &#39;alternative media&#39; - but without debate...<br><br>How dare you express what almost everyone thinks?😅<br><br>Love from Sweden!❤"
Piers looks good. This woman in red is a human tick.
Good to finally see a appearance sence your last one holding princess Leia captive in Star Wars
"Excuses,🙄 Go work out"
I cant believe it&#39;s not butter .
Trump 2024
Piers….220??? Sir add that 40lbs to your weight
She is dead 😂
"😂 emphasising the word BIG in that question, made my day"
"Well you are celebrating anorexic models, who are losing hair and teeth right? So what’s the difference"
"I watched a lot of guests here and this guest goes ad hominem. In the chess game of logic , this guest lost big time"
64.6 BMI is beyond crazy!!!
Is the cow still alive?
THE WORLD IS GOING BACK TO FRONT
&quot;model&quot; 😂😂😂
Piers has a beautiful  build very fit person she can&#39;t  reach for any thing else. Sad comment lady
A model for what? Dumper trucks?
So now barnyard cattles are called Models too ?
The eyebrows on the “Model” are a felony too!
I think she got hungry just from sitting there and having to talk more than she usually would. lol 😂
He’s 60 pounds over weight
One person is intelligent on this panel. Not either women.
The nerve this woman has is ... well huge.
In answer to his question about him reflecting a clinically dangerous weight. He is. Anything over weight is still clinically dangerous even if it is slightly. So yeah na he really can&#39;t talk
she is delusional making fun of not looking fun at all...BODY POSITIVITY MOVEMENT IS THE ONLY MOVEMENT THAT DOESNT REQUIRE TO MOVE
she really thought she <b>ate</b> after this
"Piers, if there are tv journalist like you , then anything is possible"
She likes eating what&#39;s the problem with that LOL
"I am judgemental against overweight people. Not proud of it, it&#39;s an automatic emotional reaction."
Diet has a 95 percent failure rate? Examples <br><br>She failed to put the box of doughnuts away<br>She failed to order a salad<br>She failed to choose water over soda<br>She failed to not over eat <br>She failed to take morning walks<br>She failed to pass on the butter
friendly fire isnt tolerated
Guys the girl coudnt make it up the stairs herself... Simple. piers is right lets face it
Nobody 600 lbs is a model for anything except donuts
Obesity = sickness
Jus&quot; buy a LARGE WIDE Angle Lens!
Moo 🐮
BIG backlash.  Who did she eat?
🐘🐘🐘🐘 borne as a 😮
I like piers
My phone screen is bent down to the right now
She said” I did it to get paid” 😂😂😂
Need Katie Hopkins on this pannel.
how the F can people be so lazy
Don&#39;t skinny people die of heart attack.
Get some help there’s too many options for weight loss and to be healthy is the quality of life that you live not longevity
&quot;Diets are 95% failure rate&quot;.  Yup that is why you don&#39;t diet.  You change your lifestyle.  Eating less calories than your daily requirement is medical science fact in losing weight.
"Bet if she walked down the street in that dress kids would be running behind her screaming &quot;HEY KOOL-ADE!!!   <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ssIfY7OFG5OykQOpn4CQCw""></a>"
Let’s face it… nobody WANTS to look like that <br>Literally nobody
"Everyone deserves love but think about it, you hardly ever seen obese elderly people. I think that says a lot."
"She is delusional!  Thank you, Piers."
His wife encourages it. She likes him that big. It’s a sexual fetish.
"As an obese woman with walking issues due to car accidents without medical because ex was drunk, it is hard to lose weulight and i think its disgusting to glorify obesity. Its hard it hurts"
They are raking in ten thousand pounds a month so it is all about the money.

It&#39;s more of a loser kind of way.. so that makes it 100% fine!
Lmfao I was waiting for this one
I commented on her apology and my comment was the only one that didn’t get any likes 💀
She dug her own grave with this one
"I think your the uncle of packgod, your a roaster too, am i wrong?"
"&quot;lets supersize, the Mcdonalds fries&quot; was probably the hardest line anyone has ever heard."
It&#39;s been a year now... Wow
&quot;misinformation&quot;
Ngl Moist is a roast king
You look like a homeless dude.
she did a terrible apology and even worse the lyrics don&#39;t make any sense she made the music industry and humanity mad thats just impressive
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyIKCv4AnB4&amp;t=373"">6:13</a> just a timestamp for my favorite part"
what eventually happened to her?
hawking a what?? tu- tu- tuahh..

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyIKCv4AnB4&amp;t=34"">0:34</a> what happened to the dog?"
she looks like a walten files character
"Remember back when we saw Logan Paul’s apology and thought, “No one can do worse than this.” 💀"
The best thing we got out of this is a megagonefree cover
this hurted all them victims
"nah i could not watch the video till the end <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI""></a>"
Don’t think this is an apology
The fact that she’s a mom is fucking nuts
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyIKCv4AnB4&amp;t=245"">4:05</a> - Oh, you mean Delunium? It&#39;s an isotope with an atomic weight of &quot;WTF is wrong with you?&quot;"

Already making a song to apologise shows that u r not taking shit seriously
"hey, its my first time here, but man have you earned my respect"
She’s the female version of EDP445 P Diddy R.Kelly and Dan Snihender she doesn’t want to take accountability for her own actions she’s a PDF
"All I hear is &#39;trauma&#39;, &#39;harm&#39;, &#39;victims&#39; etc.. what horrible thing did she do?"
DEFACATION STATION KILLED ME
The singing is actually pretty good ngl
Bruh
Her accused for very bad stuff<br>Her response: no your wrong anyway here&#39;s a shit song

"I&#39;ve been following this story since a little while after the allegations came out, but I never saw Charlie&#39;s take on it. I used to be subscribed to her vlog channel and I remember at one point there were videos she uploaded where she couldn&#39;t talk because she had a node on her vocal chords that could have caused her serious vocal damage and would have prevented her from ever singing and performing again. Is it wrong for me to wish that actually happened under the want that this video never happened?"

the fact that she actually was on broadway
She is still active.She uploaded a vlog video 3 days ago and all the comments I saw were supporting and complimenting her????Why is she still on the platform??? YOUTUBE DO SOMETHING

"My favourite part is when she says “They said I couldn’t say what I wanted to say but never that I couldn’t sing what I want to say” And then goes on to stop singing and talk about her gobeldygook then sings her little chorus then starts talking, Over and over and then my ears are free from torture"
Imagine Siennna Mae dancing while Coleen sings
She should get together with Featureman and fly away off of yt.
"As a 13 year old, she kinda bad"
"&quot;Your honor, nuh uh&quot; -Colleen, probably"
Wow an year ago a year ago

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyIKCv4AnB4&amp;t=505"">8:25</a> This is by far the part of this appalling shitstorm of an apology video that made me the most mad, and we&#39;re setting the bar pretty fuckin high. It pisses me off that instead of actually taking accountability (not singing about it but not doing it), she&#39;s basically saying she didnt do it when theres proof. But this specific part of the song that i linked just pisses me off the most because now shes basically calling us the bad people and victimizing herself the most. Fuck this"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyIKCv4AnB4&amp;t=458"">7:38</a> just trust me bro ✋"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyIKCv4AnB4&amp;t=443"">7:23</a> you actually sang better than her. Props to you!"
Colleen Ballinger’s apology is a YouTube video that makes me wish the dislike button still existed
"Fun fact: the newest comments (the newest one is three months ago since she recently turned off comments.) are saying: “GuRl YoU diD nOtHiNg WrOnG, I wAnNa GiVe YoU a BiG hUg.”"

This wasn&#39;t an apology. This was a murder
"See, this is why Jenna Marbles is a good person. She didn&#39;t downplay any of what happened that led to her apologizing, she didn&#39;t blame anyone, she didn&#39;t defend her actions, she simply and earnestly apologized and sought to validate those who were hurt and better herself. She did the right thing and she didn&#39;t victimize herself or blame anyone. She knew what she did was wrong and wanted to better herself. She also didn&#39;t apologize to gain good faith back, she simply wanted to apologize to those she hurt and validate them. She did it for purely selfless reasons. Because she&#39;s a true philanthropist.<br>I really hope she&#39;s happy and doing well for herself."

If Colleen wasn&#39;t as MASSIVE of a YouTuber would these videos even been made ? It seems to come off as if they weren&#39;t super famous they wouldn&#39;t make the video calling her out for these acts.  <br>Can we please start making videos calling out disgusting weirdos too ? There is actual SICKO&#39;S out doing S3XUAL ACTS ON CHILDREN.<br>It seems like if you can get a crazy amount of views its not getting a video made ....
Lmfao this is funny. And your voice is beautiful
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=806"">13:26</a> She sounds like a cartoon character, I literally love it sm 😂"
I love how she says that her “apology” won’t change anyone’s mind about her but before the video went viral I had no idea what was going on but seeing it made it cement in my mind that she definitely did what she was being accused of…
I’ll admit I said creepy things when I was younger but I was a teen/preteen…. I’m now 21 and realize how creepy it was and throughly regret it. I cannot imagine doing even worse now or being 30 💀💀
"Well, it was kind of a trend to make videos on this apology ukele video thing. Trends to get alot of views, that&#39;s why people do them. So she was right about that. People do make them for money fundamentally. Im sure that there are crazier dramas happening but are less know hence less exposure. So less money"
"gurl, i have no problem with the WOAH! Jeez"
No way<br><br><br>…Read more
Collen paused the comments on the og video💀
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=51"">0:51</a> GAMECUUUUBE!?"
She goes up to an E not an F. I literally checked because I was so impressed by your note recognition lol. Still not too far off!
"Girl, I have just find you and I think &quot;well, that video was good, I don&#39;t think she has anything else for me (as I&#39;m Spanish)&quot; and then I see another &quot;joya&quot; in my feed! I love what you do and how you do it, thank you!"
Damn gabi hit them vocals
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=702"">11:42</a> Spot on! 🎯<br>Yes she is really cringing out on her Ukelele of Shame.<br>She is so condesending and pleased with herself.<br>Hope she has YouTubed for the last time."
She basically parodied herself. And with a Schoolhouse Rock bullshit song.
"Watching this a year after it happened, so thought she must have disappeared off internet. No no she has a new channel that she uplaods to regularly with 3.5 million subscribers."
I loved your musical addition to her singing hahaha made the whole thing.
I DO ALSO SING THIS WHEN I MESS UP IN LIFE
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=810"">13:30</a> I want a full 10-11 minute version of this"
This girls fck up is ultimately what lead me to find this channel and here I am a year and change later still tuning in so I guess rock on Toxic Gossip Train?<br>I wonder what happened she ultimately ended up working at KFC right?
Her calling us a “toxic gossip train” is her way of<br>Apologizing?? Talk about a shitty person
girls suck at apologies and a female youtuber will be worse lol
"I hate that she sings it about the allegations against her because honestly it’s like, not a bad song. Just doesn’t apply to her situation lmao"
"Do Conor McGregor&#39;s &quot;apology&quot;, when he got his second belt."
if it wasnt by her it woulda been a banger
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=33"">0:33</a> when i was younger she always gave me an off feeling and i just couldn&#39;t place it... well now i know why"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=234"">3:54</a> why are her eyes so creepy 😭"
"I just could never wrap my head around pedophiles, like how do you like kids?"
I can’t believe I forgot about this. It’s only been a year
Gabi has such a pretty singing voice like dead a$$ I loved the end where she sang. Also side not I got a GMC add right after miranda said &quot;F*ck me right&quot;💀
"I think her mistake here was not apologizing as a fictional gangster like Kevin Spacey. Actually, fictional gangster ukulele apology video; That&#39;s what we all need for healing."
A year ago?
"&quot;It isn&#39;t true, and I did it in the past so it&#39;s not fair&quot;??????????????"
"Super wierd? Creepy? No it&#39;s criminal. Calling it wierd, creepy, or cringe is shining a light on an action but being wierd, creepy, or cringe is also an excuse that the actions committed don&#39;t warrant full accountability. An adult engaging with minors in a sexual discussion that goes beyond the realm of education or mentorship is criminal. I&#39;m part way through this video of yours and I hope you call the spade a spade."
"Still funny, I haven&#39;t gotten used to it though"
"Hot take everyone will hate: the idea of grooming a straight teenage boy, is absolutely laughable! no teenage boy in the history of ever was harmed by having sex with an older woman. Ever.  Never happened and I defy you to find one REAL example.<br>    Uptight, self-righteous members of society have harmed them.  <br>   I’m sorry, but there are some differences in the sexes that hold through the vast majority of the time.<br>   The only harm that would come to a straight teenage boy, would be how sore his hand would be from getting high-fived so much by his bros.<br>    I like Gabby but she’s totally wrong on this one.<br>   People are just trying to gossip and profit from it.  they didn’t even have sex, it’s freaking underwear. That kid could go to JCPenney and buy some himself. I don’t believe for one second any harm. Came to that kid because some cute older chick sent him some underwear. <br>  I am not a boomer, nor a redneck and I am college educated… this is still ridiculous and I’m not gonna jump on the bandwagon."
Colleen is way too creepy to look at for me to finish this video lol
"Calling it &quot;weird&quot; is wrong. Just imagine it was a guy talking to underage girls. Yeah, you wouldn&#39;t call that &quot;weird&quot;, would you?"
i could never watch her whole song fully through but every few months i watch it and just watch a bit more than last time and get increasingly more shocked about how tf this was real
i could’ve listened to free bird instead of this
genuinely what was her thought process though? was she actually deluded enough to think this would go over well? did she think she wrote such a banger people would fucking stream it and forget about all of the (proven) allegations?? insane behavior
"She wasn&#39;t that creepy, y&#39;all are just being petty and pedantic.<br><br>You think 13 year olds don&#39;t talk about &quot;whether you lost your virginity?&quot; It&#39;s all they talk about<br><br>Fr stop overthinking it - and who cares about sending a bra to someone, they probably found it funny. Just now people are getting hella sensitive about every tiny ass detail.<br><br>Go out for a walk or get a hobby instead of overanalyzing details of someone&#39;s past at a time where people were less woke"
"The thing about children in her audience is because she&#39;s brought up children onto the stage during her live shows and done REALLY inappropriate stuff to them. She&#39;s had a little boy pat her crotch or smth (don&#39;t remember that exactly, and shamed a girl for wearing short shorts (because that&#39;s like one of her common jokes????) and had her spread her legs to the audience."
It feels crazy that this was just a year ago
I&#39;m a millennial and I would like NOT to be put in the same category as this weirdo...
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=54"">0:54</a> except WAAAAAAY less good. Like, 1 billion times less good."
Her saying she’s not manipulating and then proceeding to pretend end the video and fake an on the spot encore is hilarious
The best part of this apology is the guitar hero chart
"You also can&#39;t take accountability lol. You can take responsibility, or you can be accountable."
bot whares the greens??
"You ate that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=412"">6:52</a>"
I watched Colleen’s vid for the first time and said out loud “she was on Broadway?” 😭
"that whole &quot;dramatize, monetize, demise&quot; rhyme scheme was some &quot;lyrical spiritual miracle&quot; type shit"
When you started singing with her I lost it XDDDD
Yeah but it sounded like she was taking acountability and then she called you out on monetising her demise. 😅😅😅😅 sounds to me like your only point is that she is playing a uke . Never heard of this woman and don’t really know you either but ….. 😂😂😂😂
"&quot;I&#39;m not a groomer, I&#39;m just a loser.&quot; Don&#39;t worry you can always be both 😊😊😊😊"
"i feel the need to share that my sister bought a ukulele and learned how to play toxic gossip train. We shared a bedroom.<br>Also, I feel the need to talk about one of my favourite YouTubers, an artimator who yes, is an adult and yes, talks to their fans. But also.. they’re not exactly asking us about our favourite positions.? And they’ve said that if they start being creepy we all have full permission to ruin them, which believe me, I will"
"Shes like &quot;sorry i groomed kids, didnt know everyone else was perfect&quot;"
You’ve got a lovely voice Gabi
Imagine if a man had done this stuff.
Hate to say it and I’m sure it’s auto tuned from hell and back but the vocal quality slaps
I hate Ukeleles so much
"I don&#39;t get it why all the hate for miners, they work so hard in hars conditions in coal mines etc, and for some reasons everyone online are saying basically that none of them should find happiness and love."
Why her hed so big
"The toxic gossip train absolutely exists, it just doesn&#39;t apply to her. The internet has been a cesspool for its entire existence. The barrier of it incentivizes people to release all their nastiness because we think there aren&#39;t going to be consequences."
You had me laughing with the ad libs 😂
YOUR VOICE IS SO BEAUTIFUL OMGGGG
&quot;You&#39;re going to make ad sense. That&#39;s what this is about. . . Not the truth.&quot;<br><br>Those things can both be true. A content creator can want to make money off their content and want the truth.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=537"">8:57</a> I share birthday with this weird, singing thing. Fucking hell."
that foundation really doesn&#39;t match her skin tone. yet another crime
The singing duet got me
"&quot;I was messaging my fans, but not in a creepy way-&quot; dude, messaging minors and trying to be their &quot;buddy&quot; when you&#39;re a grown adult? Yeah, that&#39;s creepy!"
"Okay man, I get Drake&#39;s a bad guy but coming after his race is not the right move."
"&quot;as long as it&#39;s entertainingggggggg&quot; (ah yes! because concern for someone being a pedo, a groomer, INTERESTED IN CHILDREN- as a full, (of knowing age.) adult, is entertaining. I am certainly entertained by the thought of your gross endeavors, thoughts, conversations w fans (minors), and you being a predator, Colleen. I&#39;m just confused to this day, what was that line??? What was every line?????)"

"Oh man, that&#39;s &quot;undert(r)aining&quot;... ^^"
"Colleen does not care, she is going to be canceled so why bother saying sorry"
"Does she... does she actually <i>know</i> what accountability means? This is a genuine question because I don&#39;t think she does. The definition of accountability is to hold yourself responsible for your actions. Someone who is accountable is someone who would realize they did wrong, admit to doing wrong so as to not throw anyone else under the bus, and then do whatever it takes to redeem themselves. This is the definition google gave me: &quot;You don&#39;t blame others or make excuses, and you do what you can to make amends when things go wrong.&quot;<br><br>Let&#39;s recap. She denies that anything happened, starts accusing her audience of spreading lies for fun, accuses them of over exaggerating, claims that she is the victim, and then changes her story to &#39;I did do it, kinda&#39; for no reason than to accuse the audience of ignoring that she &quot;already DID fix things&quot;. That&#39;s a lot of words and none of them are actually something an accountable person would say."
She really used a skin smoothing filter like she wants to look good for her future victims. give us a break
Try to strike a cord and it’s probably a minorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr……
would be even more funny if she used autotune like the tiktokers lmfao

"This is my first time even listening to this person&#39;s music or voice or whatever, she got a good good voice... For it to be wasted like this makes me wanna cry"
I love it when you sing along with her! 🤭🤭🤣🤣
girl the harmonies im dying 😂
The thing about the last section where she says that it’s just a mistake is the fact that she did that mistake repeatedly for a couple of years so she thought that it was okay to do it back in the day.
YOU WERE IN YOUR THIRTHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
You&#39;re over 30~
"Something I hate tho is that some new friends I don’t even know what she did I said in her and some people that obviously don’t care what she did involved in the past so it doesn’t even matter what she did and which is making me mad because most of those months ago, and the video was that “” she did nothing wrong ““ clearly dont know what she did so they’re not supporting or taking people that have been for a while, taking it serious, which is why new fans really helpful, sexually harassed and mostly minors and they don’t know or don’t care because it was in the past apparently so yeah that’s just weird"
she is a narcissist😂
i have to sit down and watch her apology  im not going to watch her video not going to given her more views
"If I were in charge, her channel would&#39;ve been terminated after this video"
"I genuinely don’t get why you’re calling this an apology, it isn’t, she isn’t sorry"
"As a millennial musician, im offended. @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=335"">5:35</a> She is just odd, herself. Lol"
She kinda ate downnnn on the vocals and writing I’m SAURYYY

When Colleen said (sorry SANG)  &quot;well I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not gonna take that route&quot; that was literally the duck song
this fr going to my liked spotify songs
She literally told on herself more than 3 times in this video alone 😂 she knew what she did
We can criticize her all we want but she ate. Lmao.

I knew she was weird when parts of her Miranda Sings act was alluding to incest with her uncle.
im a little late but she looks like momo in that picture HAHAH
it’s SO theater kid coded it’s actually physically uncomfortable
Its WILD because there is actual PROOF of what she&#39;s being accused of and then she sings about taking accountability 😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀
Fun fact: she wrote this song in the key of a minor. I wish I was kidding.

What about logan paul?

my left ear enjoyed liver king&#39;s apology
But yet people still support Travis Scott to this day
🎶toxic gossip traaaaaiin🎶
Can’t forget the ukelele..
"I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologize. What we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There&#39;s a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn&#39;t. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologize to the internet. I want to apologize to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But most importantly I want to apologize to the victim and his family. For my fans who are defending my actions, please don&#39;t. I don’t deserve to be defended. The goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world I live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don’t expect to be forgiven, I’m just here to apologize. I&#39;m ashamed of myself. I’m disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you."
the dog in team modern&#39;s apology looks like &quot;yeah and why the fuck should i care&quot;
"For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve 1 Corinthians 15:3-5❤❤❤❤😊"
completely forgot about the fine brothers and how they wanted to take ownership for the word “react”
Its funny that now all of these have been eclipsed by Colleen Ballingers.
if someone didnt know any better they would think that sienna&#39;s apology was just another video about inspiration maybe and not in response to a heinous act toxic women like her try and almost always get away with but laura&#39;s apology pissed me the FOOK off for one reason and one reason only...  her fake crying was one thing but I watched the whole thing once and when she spat tryna make it look something real it grossed me out so much to the point where it pisses me off 😭she dribbled and drooled like a crying toddler on camera as if she wasn&#39;t anything other than a 30 some yr old woman if you don&#39;t get yo ahh off the ground 😭😭
I’m Sorry but you forgot P. Diddy and Will Smith and Paula Deen and Michael Richards 😂😂😂
"ukelele should have been the 0th one , but im assuming you didnt include it because it wasn&#39;t much of an apology 💀💀💀"
No uleleke?
Your videos are dope but they end so abruptly it throws me off 😂
Sigma
Make one that has the best YouTube apologies
"Let&#39;s face it, a youtuber could put out the most sincere apology video and the masses still won&#39;t accept it. They&#39;ll gripe that they don&#39;t apologise and they&#39;ll gripe if they do. It&#39;s a lose-lose situation really."
I’m surprised that Colleen vlogs isn’t here😭💀
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=730"">12:10</a> i can&#39;t watch her yapping"
I made apology video because of racism to the gingers in my school.
I keep insisting that Travis Was high on some dope ass shit thats why he looks like he didnt know what happened on the concert
"I don’t understand why that social repose guy needed to apologize? I mean, sure, he needed to apologize to his girlfriend, but why did he need to make a public apology to his fans? He didn’t cheat on his fans."
&quot;Besides it&#39;s almost impossible to have an apology worst...&quot;<br><b>Number 3 on the list</b>
Wow. To think just a few months after this Colleen would blow almost all of these out of the water.
"Anyone starting a YouTube channel, get your apology ready before you start. Always be prepared, don’t wanna land on this list"
Waiting for Mrbeasts apology
Sienna&#39;s was the worst. She did an interpretive dance thinking it makes amends for her raping that dude.
"Why is Laura crying when she’s the one who did it “And this video has been so hard” “It’s almost impossible” “It’s so hard, it’s probably the hardest things I’ve ever done” she did nothing but cry, the most sincere apology I’m really done with her, glad she got canceled on twitter ^^ :]"
"Sienna’s is crazy dude it’s like she made it a documentary and even worse she said the Sam smith song which had the lyrics “I did nothing wrong, I’m young” now wonder it’s the second worst apology video"
The Social Repose Apology Video’s dislike and like ratio is a like a lightsaber💀
The best apology ever was the Manii show&#39;s
How is Logan Paul&#39;s not included?
Most of them sound like they are saying sorry in school after hitting little Timmy on the playground 😭😭😭
"Sunny, I&#39;m a little disappointed.  I&#39;ve made over 16 public apologies here on YouTube -- all of which are terrible, and didn&#39;t even get an honorable mention here? Loce your content, but thie one hurt. Also, I just want to apologize."
Can&#39;t wait for Mr beast to be on part 2
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=410"">6:50</a> NO NOT TMARTN HE GOATED"
this was made like right before the toxic gossip train hit single came out
I wish it was a top 15.. i miss james charles / jeffree star ect 😂
Damn I was hoping for creepy ukulele song from Colleen
I hate people like this ( people in the video )
I wonder if sunny is going to make a part two if mrbeast makes an apology video
If travis stopped singing do you think they wouldve stopped charging the concert. Because i dont
Did you plan to not have logan paul in there or did you just forget <br><br>&quot;I have made a continuous lapse of my judgement&quot;

Where’s the ukulele girl? Colleen Ballinger?
"I feel very fortunate that I can say: Other than Travis Scott, I&#39;ve not heard of any of these people before. It&#39;s baffling that people would spend their time watching &quot;influencers&quot; like these who talk about things that really don&#39;t matter in life."

"What kind of fucking thought process goes on where cheating on your lover leads to uploading an apology video on Youtube? SORRY FANS, I CHEATED ON MY GIRLFRIEND, I NEED TO APOLOGISE TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE NEGATIVE INVOLVEMENT OTHER THAN JUST BAGGING ME OUT WHEN MY EX GIRLFRIEND MADE A VIDEO ABOUT ME!"
I misread that ”at” as ”ai”
"She just mashed Simply Kenna&#39;s, Team Modern&#39;s, and Shane Dawson&#39;s Re-Apology, Acting like it&#39;s hard, and Saying basic random stuff."
"&quot;BrAgGiNg AbOuT mOnEy.&quot;<br><br>Bro, does just SAYING you&#39;re rich count as bragging? Bragging would be saying something like &quot;I&#39;m richer than you cuz I&#39;m better than you.&quot;"
Think the NoahJ456 video belongs on this list nowadays
Wish this video was made later because NoahJ456 would 10000000000% be on this list lol
He left out the ukulele
Me personally i don&#39;t feel like it was fully travis scott fault people broke in his concert and it was crowded because of those people yes he should have stopped which is no excuses for that but both parties are wrong kinda
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=122"">2:02</a> Why’s Shane Dawson really sound like Mlp fluttershy with an lower voice volume. 😅"
You may need to update this…
kinda surprised logan paul isnt in here
1 thing I will never understand is how people say stuff like &quot; this is one of my hardest videos ever&quot; like what is hard about this just sit in front of the camera and make a sincere apology it is not that difficult
where was the ukelele one?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=381"">6:21</a> ‘I rehearsed this instead of just talking to you guys naturally’ That’s every day for me 😂"
"If the fine bros actually just took down every reaction video, then SSsniperwolf would be a completely different channel."
Logan paul japan forest apology
I love these quaint apologies from the olden days. No ukeleles or anything.
are there any good apology video?
I havent heard of any of these people..
Shane? more like Shame
Then he didn’t come across it by random.
Wow he got kid a killed not cool.
"Uh, IDK if it is for clout but why is Pewdiepie in the description?"
"Binge-Worthy Content, Keep it up Sunny"
You should cover The Manii Show&#39;s apology since it&#39;s like the first YouTube apology that was actually good.
R.I.P to all the people who died in the Travis Scott concert. ❤
"the worst part about travis scott&#39;s mistake and apology: if he just stopped the show like people said, he could&#39;ve avoided all the deaths and injuries he caused"
Sunnyv2: huh what’s that noise?<br><br>* Ukulele starts playing*
Not me waiting for the toxic gossip train
if you have to make an apology video with another one? your done at this point lol😂
I like that everyone’s coming back to this video after Colleen Ballinger’s “apology” video. It’s the toxic gossip trainnnn
I’m so glad I don’t know who any of these people are (except Travis) and never watched their “content”. Shows me I’m on the right path in life.
All aboard!
Nah. Colleen Ballinger has a worse apology than the top 2. She’s recently made another apology for her previous apology
Why are there tears in the thumbnail? Is this click bait??? 🙃
Dancing while apology is so good.<br><br><br><br>Just kidding<br><br><br>It&#39;s the WORST F4CKING APOLOGY IN THE UNIVERSE.<br><br>WHO WILL FORGIVE HER NO ONE....
Nah aint no way she just emoted to an SA charge that is actually fuckin wild
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
She looks like a naked barbie
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=258"">4:18</a>  😂"
But he doesnt have a beard
tuned in for one stream and my penis grew a whopping 5 inches
She ruined Sam Smith for me
Why is she dancing around an empty apartment in her underwear 🩲
"you know what’s awful, she’s still popular despite clearly being an abuser"
"As an (actual) dancer, your eyes don&#39;t deceive you. This isn&#39;t some &quot;Y&#39;all aren&#39;t cultured enough to understand her dance&quot; thing. She&#39;s just not good at dancing. It doesn&#39;t even go with the music lmao"
"On another note:<br><br>SICK moves Charlie, no way those cops would still arrest you for arson. Especially after the Mickey Mouse throw back."
"I know I’m 2 years late on this particular vid, but I’ve gone down a weird fucking rabbit hole tonight that brought me to videos of penguinz past, but this statement is the most factual statement I’ve heard all day:<br><br>“What a privileged life to live where that’s your biggest struggle.”<br><br>That’s exactly what I thought when she said that B.S.<br>And then I laughed because not only did she say that, but she doubled down and said “Yeah, that’s the one. It’s going in the final cut.” 😂 jeezus"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=223"">3:43</a> 🤣🤣"
"This inspired me to live with integrity. Better to go down an upfront villain, than this."
Cringe
"&quot;I don&#39;t think anything is gonna beat Sienna Mae&#39;s&quot; That didn&#39;t age well, especially after Colleen."
Edp445 and dr disrespect should dance
"This is uplifting, because at least your not her."
If a month without social media is so hard than indian mud farmers must be living in nightmare difficulty
"Confused to why, she’s not in jail what if the tables were turned ? 🤔"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=203"">3:23</a> got me 😂"
Imagine if Dr disrespect comes back and does this 😂
dr
&quot;I am sorry I assaulted you&quot; <b>whips the nae nae</b>

Inspire. LMAO. She thinks she’s inspiring.
"She’s used to men falling at her feet and giving her millions of compliments. In her eyes she can do no wrong because men tell her how hot she is all day, everyday.<br>So why should she follow the rules of society? She’s young and hot! She’s above the law.<br>She just thinks she’s SO CUTE<br><br><b>not inspired</b>"
"i know this is an old video, but what is up with the way zoomers talk? like the way they move their lips looks so fake and forced. 
<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=128"">2:08</a> it is like instead of just talking naturally she is consciously choosing how to make her lips move, seems so unnatural"
“It’s like a ballet recital” made me laugh 😭😭
"&quot;Kiss a hundred boys and feel like I&#39;m not tied to them.&quot;<br><br>Ummm...... oh, no...."
This thing aged like milk
lmao.... it&#39;s okay because she&#39;s an attractive female. a man would&#39;ve been sentenced to prison
Why is the boy in this situation being believed beyond any doubt??? That video of &quot;proof&quot; was edited and 3 seconds short with no context what so ever...they lived in a house that was filled with kids who would rob a bank for content! This boy was all over her as well...FOR CONTENT. I really hope yall eat your words when true evidence comes out.
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=140"">2:20</a> I&#39;m pretty sure she was referring to the time in her life and the accusations being the hardest time in her life...not going off social media...that&#39;s common sense."
"Jack wright: i have been sexually assualted<br>Sienna mae: dances to a song with the lyrics &quot;i&#39;ve done nothing wrong, i&#39;m young&quot; and calls it an apology"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=212"">3:32</a> Dude I was wheezing at this for like 15 minutes straight. Real tears were flowing.<br><br>“Hit em with the Mickey Mouse clubhouse dance” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=173"">2:53</a> LMFAOO the fact that she clarified “unedited” photos is fucking hilarious. Probably got called out for photoshopping shit and got angry about it LOL<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=220"">3:40</a> EXACTLY LIKE WHY DID SHE CLARIFY THE UNEDITED PART BWAHAHA"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=89"">1:29</a> &quot;Well, that one didn&#39;t age quite so well!&quot;"
"The music in that video is incredibly shitty! She must be a psychopath just for choosing that song. What a nightmare that was having to watch her horrible dancing, it&#39;s so cringe!"
I don&#39;t think Sam Smith would approve of the video if they saw it.
Charlie breakin it down was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen in my life
Ngl Charlie got some better moves than me
This apology just Seems like a big fuck you to the guy she molested
ukulele joke
"if you combine all the brain cells of the people who put this apology together,<br><br>you’d get half a brain cell"
Sienna is a worse dancer than Prince Harry and Yoko Ono! 🤣
here so many years later. &quot;Come add a few inches to your penis&quot; is still the most jarring statement ive heard from a streamer. love it
“I feel proud of the person that I am” JESUS FUCKING YIKES
Shouldn&#39;t even call them apology videos.
🎶🎶🎶I&#39;m sorry I assaulted you🎶🎶🎶- W2S
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I assulted you&quot; - W2S<br><br>😭
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=222"">3:42</a> is my favorite part"
I hope Sam Smith sends her a cease and desist for besmirching his song like that
If Charlie ever makes an Apologie video and dances I will probably be convinced
"Sadly, I could see many public figures doing this sort of non-pology"
She&#39;s disgusting.
Hey Sienna you&#39;ve just been accused of sexual assault and theres video evidence.<br><br>Whats your response? <br>Sienna: 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
Taking advantage of someone while they’re in the most vulnerable state and then addressing your social media status and dancing is such a disgusting move. What an absolute piece of filth
I wonder how the original creators of this song feel that she used their song
This video didn’t age very well <br>Considering the Amanda apology
Scientist really have to look into this bro like how can some people have negative iq that’s ground breaking discovery right there
Sienna Mae dancing ❌<br>Charlie dancing ✔
Sienna Mae probably inspired a plethora of Rapists with this dance her way out of accountability
I love you moist critikal have my babys
"When she pushed herself on him, she could not fathom that at any moment that she was in anyway going to be rejected. I mean, shes so irristable to all right?  She was more than amazed that he wanted nothing of the sort, bottom line."
I love contemporary dance and this woman just ruined it🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
abused by a girl who kissed him. What do you know about abuse
"This is worse than Colleen&#39;s sorry, she made a whole interpretative dance 😂"
her apology video is actually insulting af
"I had to come back to this just to confirm her name, she just popped up on my snap and her name sounded way to familiar"
I guess I&#39;m getting old but this s*** is so  common
That gotta be the worst Apology video of my life
PUT SOME CLOTHES ON LADY
"Hey, why did you hit a 3 year old kid with your car going at 170 miles an hour!!!<br><br>Sienna: IM YOUNG ✨️💅"
Yo colleen balinger just upted the anty. Cringe 💀
Man the toxic gossip train really be chugging down the tracks of misinformation
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=32"">0:32</a> no Skyrim npcs are at least coherent"
When I watched the apology video I felt like I was gonna go to Hell for watching it. Plz help I need Logan Paul apology video...
"The fact that the producers were like “Yeah, this is perfect. Everyone will forgive her now!”"
Pewds charlie made her even more famous
"I love her “apology” was basically her saying “I’m young, stop being mean to me for committing one of the worst crimes out there.” 0 clue why she was acting like she did nothing and didn’t commit SA on a guy. Also that’s the stupidest excuse ever, saying “I’m young!” so am I, I’m a teenager, younger than you. But if I committed a crime, just bc I’m a teenager I’m not not responsible."
"ik im like a year late but <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=213"">3:33</a> this is the best apology video out there, it doesnt get better then this"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=365"">6:05</a> little did he know…"
I seriously commend the people watching both this and Colleen&#39;s apologies completely<br>I can&#39;t watch more than 5 seconds of the actual apologies without wanting to vomit my brain and hearts out
"it legit made me choke by laughter, It reminded me Kronk in the Emperor´s new groove movie, when his angel and  devil are arguing and the devil says &quot;reason no. 2, look what I can do &quot; and he just stands in one hand, Kronk is confused asking how is that related to anything and the angel says... no no no, wait, that&#39;s actually not that bad? <br><br>this is like the live action of that scene"
&quot; I&#39;m sorry 🙆‍♀️ I assaulted 💃 you 🕺 &quot;
so that’s why my friend start dancing on me when i die in game. Why can’t I stop laughing watching this shit.
"If malignant narcissism made a video, it would be this."
Why she dancing in her Grammas underwear. She needs to apologize for that to.
&quot;time for jack to let er rip&quot;
"Now she was a man, even her age, could you imagine what would have happened, like she would already be in Alcatraz"
Just wait for Colleen&#39;s apology
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=217"">3:37</a> 😂💀💀💀💀💀💀💀"
Such a woman apology.
This is an order of magnitude delusional than anything I&#39;ve seen before.
"Tbh, with the editing, dance, and script, I thought I was watching an unreleased apology by The Deep."
Sssniperwolf:<br><br>“Allow us to introduce ourselves”
this whole thing feels like springtrap at the end of fnaf vr dancing after taking another victim
Jack : Say sorry your a b!tch <br>Sienna : 🕺🏽
It&#39;s more of a loser kind of way.. so that makes it 100% fine!
Lmfao I was waiting for this one
I commented on her apology and my comment was the only one that didn’t get any likes 💀
She dug her own grave with this one
"I think your the uncle of packgod, your a roaster too, am i wrong?"
"&quot;lets supersize, the Mcdonalds fries&quot; was probably the hardest line anyone has ever heard."
It&#39;s been a year now... Wow
&quot;misinformation&quot;
Ngl Moist is a roast king
You look like a homeless dude.
she did a terrible apology and even worse the lyrics don&#39;t make any sense she made the music industry and humanity mad thats just impressive
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyIKCv4AnB4&amp;t=373"">6:13</a> just a timestamp for my favorite part"
what eventually happened to her?
hawking a what?? tu- tu- tuahh..

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyIKCv4AnB4&amp;t=34"">0:34</a> what happened to the dog?"
she looks like a walten files character
"Remember back when we saw Logan Paul’s apology and thought, “No one can do worse than this.” 💀"
The best thing we got out of this is a megagonefree cover
this hurted all them victims
"nah i could not watch the video till the end <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI""></a>"
Don’t think this is an apology
The fact that she’s a mom is fucking nuts
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyIKCv4AnB4&amp;t=245"">4:05</a> - Oh, you mean Delunium? It&#39;s an isotope with an atomic weight of &quot;WTF is wrong with you?&quot;"

She’s the female version of EDP445 P Diddy R.Kelly and Dan Snihender she doesn’t want to take accountability for her own actions she’s a PDF
"All I hear is &#39;trauma&#39;, &#39;harm&#39;, &#39;victims&#39; etc.. what horrible thing did she do?"

"I&#39;ve been following this story since a little while after the allegations came out, but I never saw Charlie&#39;s take on it. I used to be subscribed to her vlog channel and I remember at one point there were videos she uploaded where she couldn&#39;t talk because she had a node on her vocal chords that could have caused her serious vocal damage and would have prevented her from ever singing and performing again. Is it wrong for me to wish that actually happened under the want that this video never happened?"

"My favourite part is when she says “They said I couldn’t say what I wanted to say but never that I couldn’t sing what I want to say” And then goes on to stop singing and talk about her gobeldygook then sings her little chorus then starts talking, Over and over and then my ears are free from torture"
Imagine Siennna Mae dancing while Coleen sings
She should get together with Featureman and fly away off of yt.

It pisses me off that instead of actually taking accountability (not singing about it but not doing it), she&#39;s basically saying she didnt do it when theres proof. But this specific part of the song that i linked just pisses me off the most because now shes basically calling us the bad people and victimizing herself the most. Fuck this"

"The moment she starts at 0.1% accountability, she speeds up with 20 bpm and immediately backtracks 🤣🤣 So pathetic"
This wasn&#39;t an apology. This was a murder
"See, this is why Jenna Marbles is a good person. She didn&#39;t downplay any of what happened that led to her apologizing, she didn&#39;t blame anyone, she didn&#39;t defend her actions, she simply and earnestly apologized and sought to validate those who were hurt and better herself. She did the right thing and she didn&#39;t victimize herself or blame anyone. She knew what she did was wrong and wanted to better herself. She also didn&#39;t apologize to gain good faith back, she simply wanted to apologize to those she hurt and validate them. She did it for purely selfless reasons. Because she&#39;s a true philanthropist.<br>I really hope she&#39;s happy and doing well for herself."
"&quot;Trust me bro, anything they say is false!&quot;"
&quot;I used to message my fan but not in a creppy way&quot;--------&gt; &quot;There were times in the DMS when i would overshare details of my life&quot;  yeaaaaah not creppy at all  💀
The doggy is Gourgues!
Mr beast be going down ma bởi 🙏😭
Cringetastic 😫
Ilove how Kris Jimmy Dr disrespect and Drake is getting what they deserve BUT NOT THIS GIRL. She&#39;s also pedo but just becoz she&#39;s a girl and a mother people forgot. Racism is real on internet.
uke tab:<br>G G7 C D7 :) hope this helps xo ~
Girl literally using the legal logic of a toilet paper ad.
“SHE WAS IN HER THIRTIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEESSS”
If Colleen wasn&#39;t as MASSIVE of a YouTuber would these videos even been made ? It seems to come off as if they weren&#39;t super famous they wouldn&#39;t make the video calling her out for these acts.  <br>Can we please start making videos calling out disgusting weirdos too ? There is actual SICKO&#39;S out doing S3XUAL ACTS ON CHILDREN.<br>It seems like if you can get a crazy amount of views its not getting a video made ....
Lmfao this is funny. And your voice is beautiful
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=806"">13:26</a> She sounds like a cartoon character, I literally love it sm 😂"
I love how she says that her “apology” won’t change anyone’s mind about her but before the video went viral I had no idea what was going on but seeing it made it cement in my mind that she definitely did what she was being accused of…
I’ll admit I said creepy things when I was younger but I was a teen/preteen…. I’m now 21 and realize how creepy it was and throughly regret it. I cannot imagine doing even worse now or being 30 💀💀
"Well, it was kind of a trend to make videos on this apology ukele video thing. Trends to get alot of views, that&#39;s why people do them. So she was right about that. People do make them for money fundamentally. Im sure that there are crazier dramas happening but are less know hence less exposure. So less money"
"gurl, i have no problem with the WOAH! Jeez"
No way<br><br><br>…Read more
Collen paused the comments on the og video💀
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=51"">0:51</a> GAMECUUUUBE!?"
She goes up to an E not an F. I literally checked because I was so impressed by your note recognition lol. Still not too far off!
"Girl, I have just find you and I think &quot;well, that video was good, I don&#39;t think she has anything else for me (as I&#39;m Spanish)&quot; and then I see another &quot;joya&quot; in my feed! I love what you do and how you do it, thank you!"
Damn gabi hit them vocals
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=702"">11:42</a> Spot on! 🎯<br>Yes she is really cringing out on her Ukelele of Shame.<br>She is so condesending and pleased with herself.<br>Hope she has YouTubed for the last time."
She basically parodied herself. And with a Schoolhouse Rock bullshit song.
"Watching this a year after it happened, so thought she must have disappeared off internet. No no she has a new channel that she uplaods to regularly with 3.5 million subscribers."
I loved your musical addition to her singing hahaha made the whole thing.
I DO ALSO SING THIS WHEN I MESS UP IN LIFE
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=810"">13:30</a> I want a full 10-11 minute version of this"
This girls fck up is ultimately what lead me to find this channel and here I am a year and change later still tuning in so I guess rock on Toxic Gossip Train?<br>I wonder what happened she ultimately ended up working at KFC right?
Her calling us a “toxic gossip train” is her way of<br>Apologizing?? Talk about a shitty person
girls suck at apologies and a female youtuber will be worse lol
"I hate that she sings it about the allegations against her because honestly it’s like, not a bad song. Just doesn’t apply to her situation lmao"
"Do Conor McGregor&#39;s &quot;apology&quot;, when he got his second belt."
if it wasnt by her it woulda been a banger
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=33"">0:33</a> when i was younger she always gave me an off feeling and i just couldn&#39;t place it... well now i know why"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=234"">3:54</a> why are her eyes so creepy 😭"
"I just could never wrap my head around pedophiles, like how do you like kids?"
I can’t believe I forgot about this. It’s only been a year
Gabi has such a pretty singing voice like dead a$$ I loved the end where she sang. Also side not I got a GMC add right after miranda said &quot;F*ck me right&quot;💀
"I think her mistake here was not apologizing as a fictional gangster like Kevin Spacey. Actually, fictional gangster ukulele apology video; That&#39;s what we all need for healing."
A year ago?
"&quot;It isn&#39;t true, and I did it in the past so it&#39;s not fair&quot;??????????????"
"Super wierd? Creepy? No it&#39;s criminal. Calling it wierd, creepy, or cringe is shining a light on an action but being wierd, creepy, or cringe is also an excuse that the actions committed don&#39;t warrant full accountability. An adult engaging with minors in a sexual discussion that goes beyond the realm of education or mentorship is criminal. I&#39;m part way through this video of yours and I hope you call the spade a spade."
"Still funny, I haven&#39;t gotten used to it though"
"Hot take everyone will hate: the idea of grooming a straight teenage boy, is absolutely laughable! no teenage boy in the history of ever was harmed by having sex with an older woman. Ever.  Never happened and I defy you to find one REAL example.<br>    Uptight, self-righteous members of society have harmed them.  <br>   I’m sorry, but there are some differences in the sexes that hold through the vast majority of the time.<br>   The only harm that would come to a straight teenage boy, would be how sore his hand would be from getting high-fived so much by his bros.<br>    I like Gabby but she’s totally wrong on this one.<br>   People are just trying to gossip and profit from it.  they didn’t even have sex, it’s freaking underwear. That kid could go to JCPenney and buy some himself. I don’t believe for one second any harm. Came to that kid because some cute older chick sent him some underwear. <br>  I am not a boomer, nor a redneck and I am college educated… this is still ridiculous and I’m not gonna jump on the bandwagon."
Colleen is way too creepy to look at for me to finish this video lol
"Calling it &quot;weird&quot; is wrong. Just imagine it was a guy talking to underage girls. Yeah, you wouldn&#39;t call that &quot;weird&quot;, would you?"
i could never watch her whole song fully through but every few months i watch it and just watch a bit more than last time and get increasingly more shocked about how tf this was real
i could’ve listened to free bird instead of this
genuinely what was her thought process though? was she actually deluded enough to think this would go over well? did she think she wrote such a banger people would fucking stream it and forget about all of the (proven) allegations?? insane behavior
"She wasn&#39;t that creepy, y&#39;all are just being petty and pedantic.<br><br>You think 13 year olds don&#39;t talk about &quot;whether you lost your virginity?&quot; It&#39;s all they talk about<br><br>Fr stop overthinking it - and who cares about sending a bra to someone, they probably found it funny. Just now people are getting hella sensitive about every tiny ass detail.<br><br>Go out for a walk or get a hobby instead of overanalyzing details of someone&#39;s past at a time where people were less woke"
"The thing about children in her audience is because she&#39;s brought up children onto the stage during her live shows and done REALLY inappropriate stuff to them. She&#39;s had a little boy pat her crotch or smth (don&#39;t remember that exactly, and shamed a girl for wearing short shorts (because that&#39;s like one of her common jokes????) and had her spread her legs to the audience."
It feels crazy that this was just a year ago
I&#39;m a millennial and I would like NOT to be put in the same category as this weirdo...
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=54"">0:54</a> except WAAAAAAY less good. Like, 1 billion times less good."
Her saying she’s not manipulating and then proceeding to pretend end the video and fake an on the spot encore is hilarious
The best part of this apology is the guitar hero chart
"You also can&#39;t take accountability lol. You can take responsibility, or you can be accountable."
bot whares the greens??
"You ate that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=412"">6:52</a>"
I watched Colleen’s vid for the first time and said out loud “she was on Broadway?” 😭
"that whole &quot;dramatize, monetize, demise&quot; rhyme scheme was some &quot;lyrical spiritual miracle&quot; type shit"
When you started singing with her I lost it XDDDD
Yeah but it sounded like she was taking acountability and then she called you out on monetising her demise. 😅😅😅😅 sounds to me like your only point is that she is playing a uke . Never heard of this woman and don’t really know you either but ….. 😂😂😂😂
"&quot;I&#39;m not a groomer, I&#39;m just a loser.&quot; Don&#39;t worry you can always be both 😊😊😊😊"
"i feel the need to share that my sister bought a ukulele and learned how to play toxic gossip train. We shared a bedroom.<br>Also, I feel the need to talk about one of my favourite YouTubers, an artimator who yes, is an adult and yes, talks to their fans. But also.. they’re not exactly asking us about our favourite positions.? And they’ve said that if they start being creepy we all have full permission to ruin them, which believe me, I will"
"Shes like &quot;sorry i groomed kids, didnt know everyone else was perfect&quot;"
You’ve got a lovely voice Gabi
Imagine if a man had done this stuff.
Hate to say it and I’m sure it’s auto tuned from hell and back but the vocal quality slaps
I hate Ukeleles so much
"I don&#39;t get it why all the hate for miners, they work so hard in hars conditions in coal mines etc, and for some reasons everyone online are saying basically that none of them should find happiness and love."
Why her hed so big
"The toxic gossip train absolutely exists, it just doesn&#39;t apply to her. The internet has been a cesspool for its entire existence. The barrier of it incentivizes people to release all their nastiness because we think there aren&#39;t going to be consequences."
You had me laughing with the ad libs 😂
YOUR VOICE IS SO BEAUTIFUL OMGGGG
&quot;You&#39;re going to make ad sense. That&#39;s what this is about. . . Not the truth.&quot;<br><br>Those things can both be true. A content creator can want to make money off their content and want the truth.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=537"">8:57</a> I share birthday with this weird, singing thing. Fucking hell."
that foundation really doesn&#39;t match her skin tone. yet another crime
The singing duet got me
"&quot;I was messaging my fans, but not in a creepy way-&quot; dude, messaging minors and trying to be their &quot;buddy&quot; when you&#39;re a grown adult? Yeah, that&#39;s creepy!"
"Okay man, I get Drake&#39;s a bad guy but coming after his race is not the right move."
"&quot;as long as it&#39;s entertainingggggggg&quot; (ah yes! because concern for someone being a pedo, a groomer, INTERESTED IN CHILDREN- as a full, (of knowing age.) adult, is entertaining. I am certainly entertained by the thought of your gross endeavors, thoughts, conversations w fans (minors), and you being a predator, Colleen. I&#39;m just confused to this day, what was that line??? What was every line?????)"
"*indubitably <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=104"">1:44</a>"
Time to update the title. Cody Ko DJing Sorry by Justin Bieber is the worst ever now.

"Oh man, that&#39;s &quot;undert(r)aining&quot;... ^^"
"Colleen does not care, she is going to be canceled so why bother saying sorry"
"Does she... does she actually <i>know</i> what accountability means? This is a genuine question because I don&#39;t think she does. The definition of accountability is to hold yourself responsible for your actions. Someone who is accountable is someone who would realize they did wrong, admit to doing wrong so as to not throw anyone else under the bus, and then do whatever it takes to redeem themselves. This is the definition google gave me: &quot;You don&#39;t blame others or make excuses, and you do what you can to make amends when things go wrong.&quot;<br><br>Let&#39;s recap. She denies that anything happened, starts accusing her audience of spreading lies for fun, accuses them of over exaggerating, claims that she is the victim, and then changes her story to &#39;I did do it, kinda&#39; for no reason than to accuse the audience of ignoring that she &quot;already DID fix things&quot;. That&#39;s a lot of words and none of them are actually something an accountable person would say."
She really used a skin smoothing filter like she wants to look good for her future victims. give us a break
Try to strike a cord and it’s probably a minorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr……
would be even more funny if she used autotune like the tiktokers lmfao

"This is my first time even listening to this person&#39;s music or voice or whatever, she got a good good voice... For it to be wasted like this makes me wanna cry"
I love it when you sing along with her! 🤭🤭🤣🤣
girl the harmonies im dying 😂
The thing about the last section where she says that it’s just a mistake is the fact that she did that mistake repeatedly for a couple of years so she thought that it was okay to do it back in the day.
YOU WERE IN YOUR THIRTHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
You&#39;re over 30~
"Something I hate tho is that some new friends I don’t even know what she did I said in her and some people that obviously don’t care what she did involved in the past so it doesn’t even matter what she did and which is making me mad because most of those months ago, and the video was that “” she did nothing wrong ““ clearly dont know what she did so they’re not supporting or taking people that have been for a while, taking it serious, which is why new fans really helpful, sexually harassed and mostly minors and they don’t know or don’t care because it was in the past apparently so yeah that’s just weird"
she is a narcissist😂
i have to sit down and watch her apology  im not going to watch her video not going to given her more views
"If I were in charge, her channel would&#39;ve been terminated after this video"
"I genuinely don’t get why you’re calling this an apology, it isn’t, she isn’t sorry"
"As a millennial musician, im offended. @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=335"">5:35</a> She is just odd, herself. Lol"
She kinda ate downnnn on the vocals and writing I’m SAURYYY
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtSMxL0I3JY&amp;t=209"">3:29</a> not wrote 😂😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtSMxL0I3JY&amp;t=315"">5:15</a>"
wait what did she do?
this is the best video of my life.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtSMxL0I3JY&amp;t=462"">7:42</a> I&#39;M CRYING SHE WAS HORRIFIED 😭😭"
NOT ME WATCHING THIS IN 2x THINKING QUEN EDITED IT THAT WAY TO AVOID COPYRIGHT PLEASEEEEE. I FIGURED OUT HALFWAY PLSSSS
It’s been a year since the ukulele video released..
Her reputation was deceased after she clicked post on this video
I promise you Quen theatre doesn&#39;t do this to people she&#39;s simply lost it. The theatre kids do not claim herr 😭
Why are always white YouTubers apologizing? 😂😂😂😂
I could watch you react to ANYTHING but this was top tier😂😂😂
we all knew quen was bouta have a field day w this video
Quen’s laugh is the best thing ever
I never watched this before but she comes across a bit manic or mentally unstable in this actually.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtSMxL0I3JY&amp;t=110"">1:50</a> i turned it off. i couldn’t do it ."
“That poor ukulele” 😭
"The blank stare at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtSMxL0I3JY&amp;t=540"">9:00</a> was my reaction ong"

When Colleen said (sorry SANG)  &quot;well I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not gonna take that route&quot; that was literally the duck song
this fr going to my liked spotify songs
She literally told on herself more than 3 times in this video alone 😂 she knew what she did
We can criticize her all we want but she ate. Lmao.

"she literally asked if they lost their virginity and if they were sexually active… how is that a quirky loser, she a full on predator 💀"
I knew she was weird when parts of her Miranda Sings act was alluding to incest with her uncle.
im a little late but she looks like momo in that picture HAHAH
it’s SO theater kid coded it’s actually physically uncomfortable
Its WILD because there is actual PROOF of what she&#39;s being accused of and then she sings about taking accountability 😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀
Fun fact: she wrote this song in the key of a minor. I wish I was kidding.
Dancing while apology is so good.<br><br><br><br>Just kidding<br><br><br>It&#39;s the WORST F4CKING APOLOGY IN THE UNIVERSE.<br><br>WHO WILL FORGIVE HER NO ONE....
Nah aint no way she just emoted to an SA charge that is actually fuckin wild
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
She looks like a naked barbie

But he doesnt have a beard
tuned in for one stream and my penis grew a whopping 5 inches
She ruined Sam Smith for me
Why is she dancing around an empty apartment in her underwear 🩲
"you know what’s awful, she’s still popular despite clearly being an abuser"
"As an (actual) dancer, your eyes don&#39;t deceive you. This isn&#39;t some &quot;Y&#39;all aren&#39;t cultured enough to understand her dance&quot; thing. She&#39;s just not good at dancing. It doesn&#39;t even go with the music lmao"
"On another note:<br><br>SICK moves Charlie, no way those cops would still arrest you for arson. Especially after the Mickey Mouse throw back."
"I know I’m 2 years late on this particular vid, but I’ve gone down a weird fucking rabbit hole tonight that brought me to videos of penguinz past, but this statement is the most factual statement I’ve heard all day:<br><br>“What a privileged life to live where that’s your biggest struggle.”<br><br>That’s exactly what I thought when she said that B.S.<br>And then I laughed because not only did she say that, but she doubled down and said “Yeah, that’s the one. It’s going in the final cut.” 😂 jeezus"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=223"">3:43</a> 🤣🤣"

Cringe
"&quot;I don&#39;t think anything is gonna beat Sienna Mae&#39;s&quot; That didn&#39;t age well, especially after Colleen."
Edp445 and dr disrespect should dance
"This is uplifting, because at least your not her."
If a month without social media is so hard than indian mud farmers must be living in nightmare difficulty
"Confused to why, she’s not in jail what if the tables were turned ? 🤔"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=203"">3:23</a> got me 😂"

Inspire. LMAO. She thinks she’s inspiring.
"She’s used to men falling at her feet and giving her millions of compliments. In her eyes she can do no wrong because men tell her how hot she is all day, everyday.<br>So why should she follow the rules of society? She’s young and hot! She’s above the law.<br>She just thinks she’s SO CUTE<br><br><b>not inspired</b>"
"i know this is an old video, but what is up with the way zoomers talk? like the way they move their lips looks so fake and forced. 
<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=128"">2:08</a> it is like instead of just talking naturally she is consciously choosing how to make her lips move, seems so unnatural"
“It’s like a ballet recital” made me laugh 😭😭
"&quot;Kiss a hundred boys and feel like I&#39;m not tied to them.&quot;<br><br>Ummm...... oh, no...."
This thing aged like milk
lmao.... it&#39;s okay because she&#39;s an attractive female. a man would&#39;ve been sentenced to prison
Why is the boy in this situation being believed beyond any doubt??? That video of &quot;proof&quot; was edited and 3 seconds short with no context what so ever...they lived in a house that was filled with kids who would rob a bank for content! This boy was all over her as well...FOR CONTENT. I really hope yall eat your words when true evidence comes out.
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=140"">2:20</a> I&#39;m pretty sure she was referring to the time in her life and the accusations being the hardest time in her life...not going off social media...that&#39;s common sense."
"Jack wright: i have been sexually assualted<br>Sienna mae: dances to a song with the lyrics &quot;i&#39;ve done nothing wrong, i&#39;m young&quot; and calls it an apology"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=212"">3:32</a> Dude I was wheezing at this for like 15 minutes straight. Real tears were flowing.<br><br>“Hit em with the Mickey Mouse clubhouse dance” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=173"">2:53</a> LMFAOO the fact that she clarified “unedited” photos is fucking hilarious. Probably got called out for photoshopping shit and got angry about it LOL<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=220"">3:40</a> EXACTLY LIKE WHY DID SHE CLARIFY THE UNEDITED PART BWAHAHA"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=89"">1:29</a> &quot;Well, that one didn&#39;t age quite so well!&quot;"
"The music in that video is incredibly shitty! She must be a psychopath just for choosing that song. What a nightmare that was having to watch her horrible dancing, it&#39;s so cringe!"
I don&#39;t think Sam Smith would approve of the video if they saw it.
Charlie breakin it down was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen in my life
Ngl Charlie got some better moves than me
This apology just Seems like a big fuck you to the guy she molested
ukulele joke
"if you combine all the brain cells of the people who put this apology together,<br><br>you’d get half a brain cell"
Sienna is a worse dancer than Prince Harry and Yoko Ono! 🤣
here so many years later. &quot;Come add a few inches to your penis&quot; is still the most jarring statement ive heard from a streamer. love it
“I feel proud of the person that I am” JESUS FUCKING YIKES
Shouldn&#39;t even call them apology videos.
🎶🎶🎶I&#39;m sorry I assaulted you🎶🎶🎶- W2S
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I assulted you&quot; - W2S<br><br>😭
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=222"">3:42</a> is my favorite part"
I hope Sam Smith sends her a cease and desist for besmirching his song like that
If Charlie ever makes an Apologie video and dances I will probably be convinced
"Sadly, I could see many public figures doing this sort of non-pology"
She&#39;s disgusting.
Hey Sienna you&#39;ve just been accused of sexual assault and theres video evidence.<br><br>Whats your response? <br>Sienna: 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
Taking advantage of someone while they’re in the most vulnerable state and then addressing your social media status and dancing is such a disgusting move. What an absolute piece of filth
I wonder how the original creators of this song feel that she used their song
This video didn’t age very well <br>Considering the Amanda apology
Scientist really have to look into this bro like how can some people have negative iq that’s ground breaking discovery right there
Sienna Mae dancing ❌<br>Charlie dancing ✔
Sienna Mae probably inspired a plethora of Rapists with this dance her way out of accountability
I love you moist critikal have my babys
"When she pushed herself on him, she could not fathom that at any moment that she was in anyway going to be rejected. I mean, shes so irristable to all right?  She was more than amazed that he wanted nothing of the sort, bottom line."
I love contemporary dance and this woman just ruined it🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
abused by a girl who kissed him. What do you know about abuse
"This is worse than Colleen&#39;s sorry, she made a whole interpretative dance 😂"
her apology video is actually insulting af
"I had to come back to this just to confirm her name, she just popped up on my snap and her name sounded way to familiar"
I guess I&#39;m getting old but this s*** is so  common
That gotta be the worst Apology video of my life
PUT SOME CLOTHES ON LADY
"Hey, why did you hit a 3 year old kid with your car going at 170 miles an hour!!!<br><br>Sienna: IM YOUNG ✨️💅"
Yo colleen balinger just upted the anty. Cringe 💀
Man the toxic gossip train really be chugging down the tracks of misinformation
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=32"">0:32</a> no Skyrim npcs are at least coherent"
When I watched the apology video I felt like I was gonna go to Hell for watching it. Plz help I need Logan Paul apology video...
"The fact that the producers were like “Yeah, this is perfect. Everyone will forgive her now!”"
Pewds charlie made her even more famous
"I love her “apology” was basically her saying “I’m young, stop being mean to me for committing one of the worst crimes out there.” 0 clue why she was acting like she did nothing and didn’t commit SA on a guy. Also that’s the stupidest excuse ever, saying “I’m young!” so am I, I’m a teenager, younger than you. But if I committed a crime, just bc I’m a teenager I’m not not responsible."
"ik im like a year late but <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=213"">3:33</a> this is the best apology video out there, it doesnt get better then this"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=365"">6:05</a> little did he know…"
I seriously commend the people watching both this and Colleen&#39;s apologies completely<br>I can&#39;t watch more than 5 seconds of the actual apologies without wanting to vomit my brain and hearts out
"it legit made me choke by laughter, It reminded me Kronk in the Emperor´s new groove movie, when his angel and  devil are arguing and the devil says &quot;reason no. 2, look what I can do &quot; and he just stands in one hand, Kronk is confused asking how is that related to anything and the angel says... no no no, wait, that&#39;s actually not that bad? <br><br>this is like the live action of that scene"
&quot; I&#39;m sorry 🙆‍♀️ I assaulted 💃 you 🕺 &quot;
so that’s why my friend start dancing on me when i die in game. Why can’t I stop laughing watching this shit.
"If malignant narcissism made a video, it would be this."
Why she dancing in her Grammas underwear. She needs to apologize for that to.
&quot;time for jack to let er rip&quot;
"Now she was a man, even her age, could you imagine what would have happened, like she would already be in Alcatraz"
Just wait for Colleen&#39;s apology
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=217"">3:37</a> 😂💀💀💀💀💀💀💀"
Such a woman apology.
This is an order of magnitude delusional than anything I&#39;ve seen before.
"Tbh, with the editing, dance, and script, I thought I was watching an unreleased apology by The Deep."
Sssniperwolf:<br><br>“Allow us to introduce ourselves”
this whole thing feels like springtrap at the end of fnaf vr dancing after taking another victim
Jack : Say sorry your a b!tch <br>Sienna : 🕺🏽
Oh I remember this guy from a video called Be amazed
KSI
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=72"">1:12</a> did bro predict sabrinas album.?"
Laura Lee: the worst apology ever<br><br>Colleen: <b>Hold my beer</b>
whole idea of demanding from someone to make apology video is snowflake crying.
i mean laura stands for..L aura sooo...she matches her name lol
What about logan paul?
"No matter what people say or do in an “apology video”, people will complain.  Not sincere, too sincere, too happy, not sad enough, too soon, too late, too brief, too long, why the makeup?  Why no makeup?  It’s bananas.. lol."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=338"">5:38</a> well this aged well (contexts Colleen Balinger apology)"

my left ear enjoyed liver king&#39;s apology
But yet people still support Travis Scott to this day
🎶toxic gossip traaaaaiin🎶
Can’t forget the ukelele..
"I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologize. What we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There&#39;s a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn&#39;t. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologize to the internet. I want to apologize to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But most importantly I want to apologize to the victim and his family. For my fans who are defending my actions, please don&#39;t. I don’t deserve to be defended. The goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world I live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don’t expect to be forgiven, I’m just here to apologize. I&#39;m ashamed of myself. I’m disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you."
the dog in team modern&#39;s apology looks like &quot;yeah and why the fuck should i care&quot;
"For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve 1 Corinthians 15:3-5❤❤❤❤😊"
completely forgot about the fine brothers and how they wanted to take ownership for the word “react”
Its funny that now all of these have been eclipsed by Colleen Ballingers.
if someone didnt know any better they would think that sienna&#39;s apology was just another video about inspiration maybe and not in response to a heinous act toxic women like her try and almost always get away with but laura&#39;s apology pissed me the FOOK off for one reason and one reason only...  her fake crying was one thing but I watched the whole thing once and when she spat tryna make it look something real it grossed me out so much to the point where it pisses me off 😭she dribbled and drooled like a crying toddler on camera as if she wasn&#39;t anything other than a 30 some yr old woman if you don&#39;t get yo ahh off the ground 😭😭
I’m Sorry but you forgot P. Diddy and Will Smith and Paula Deen and Michael Richards 😂😂😂
"ukelele should have been the 0th one , but im assuming you didnt include it because it wasn&#39;t much of an apology 💀💀💀"
No uleleke?
Your videos are dope but they end so abruptly it throws me off 😂
Sigma
Make one that has the best YouTube apologies
"Let&#39;s face it, a youtuber could put out the most sincere apology video and the masses still won&#39;t accept it. They&#39;ll gripe that they don&#39;t apologise and they&#39;ll gripe if they do. It&#39;s a lose-lose situation really."
I’m surprised that Colleen vlogs isn’t here😭💀
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=730"">12:10</a> i can&#39;t watch her yapping"
I made apology video because of racism to the gingers in my school.
I keep insisting that Travis Was high on some dope ass shit thats why he looks like he didnt know what happened on the concert
"I don’t understand why that social repose guy needed to apologize? I mean, sure, he needed to apologize to his girlfriend, but why did he need to make a public apology to his fans? He didn’t cheat on his fans."
&quot;Besides it&#39;s almost impossible to have an apology worst...&quot;<br><b>Number 3 on the list</b>
Wow. To think just a few months after this Colleen would blow almost all of these out of the water.
"Anyone starting a YouTube channel, get your apology ready before you start. Always be prepared, don’t wanna land on this list"
Waiting for Mrbeasts apology
Sienna&#39;s was the worst. She did an interpretive dance thinking it makes amends for her raping that dude.
"Why is Laura crying when she’s the one who did it “And this video has been so hard” “It’s almost impossible” “It’s so hard, it’s probably the hardest things I’ve ever done” she did nothing but cry, the most sincere apology I’m really done with her, glad she got canceled on twitter ^^ :]"
"Sienna’s is crazy dude it’s like she made it a documentary and even worse she said the Sam smith song which had the lyrics “I did nothing wrong, I’m young” now wonder it’s the second worst apology video"
The Social Repose Apology Video’s dislike and like ratio is a like a lightsaber💀
The best apology ever was the Manii show&#39;s
How is Logan Paul&#39;s not included?
Most of them sound like they are saying sorry in school after hitting little Timmy on the playground 😭😭😭
"Sunny, I&#39;m a little disappointed.  I&#39;ve made over 16 public apologies here on YouTube -- all of which are terrible, and didn&#39;t even get an honorable mention here? Loce your content, but thie one hurt. Also, I just want to apologize."
Can&#39;t wait for Mr beast to be on part 2
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=410"">6:50</a> NO NOT TMARTN HE GOATED"
this was made like right before the toxic gossip train hit single came out
I wish it was a top 15.. i miss james charles / jeffree star ect 😂
Damn I was hoping for creepy ukulele song from Colleen
I hate people like this ( people in the video )
I wonder if sunny is going to make a part two if mrbeast makes an apology video
If travis stopped singing do you think they wouldve stopped charging the concert. Because i dont
Did you plan to not have logan paul in there or did you just forget <br><br>&quot;I have made a continuous lapse of my judgement&quot;
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=1"">0:01</a>"
Where’s the ukulele girl? Colleen Ballinger?
"I feel very fortunate that I can say: Other than Travis Scott, I&#39;ve not heard of any of these people before. It&#39;s baffling that people would spend their time watching &quot;influencers&quot; like these who talk about things that really don&#39;t matter in life."
Where the hell is liver kings nips
fang
I wish you put kudas from creature hub on here he had sex with co workers and so many weird things that led up to their failure please cover creature hub
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0"">00:00</a> best part"
"What kind of fucking thought process goes on where cheating on your lover leads to uploading an apology video on Youtube? SORRY FANS, I CHEATED ON MY GIRLFRIEND, I NEED TO APOLOGISE TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE NEGATIVE INVOLVEMENT OTHER THAN JUST BAGGING ME OUT WHEN MY EX GIRLFRIEND MADE A VIDEO ABOUT ME!"
I misread that ”at” as ”ai”
"She just mashed Simply Kenna&#39;s, Team Modern&#39;s, and Shane Dawson&#39;s Re-Apology, Acting like it&#39;s hard, and Saying basic random stuff."
"&quot;BrAgGiNg AbOuT mOnEy.&quot;<br><br>Bro, does just SAYING you&#39;re rich count as bragging? Bragging would be saying something like &quot;I&#39;m richer than you cuz I&#39;m better than you.&quot;"
Think the NoahJ456 video belongs on this list nowadays
Wish this video was made later because NoahJ456 would 10000000000% be on this list lol
He left out the ukulele
Me personally i don&#39;t feel like it was fully travis scott fault people broke in his concert and it was crowded because of those people yes he should have stopped which is no excuses for that but both parties are wrong kinda
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=122"">2:02</a> Why’s Shane Dawson really sound like Mlp fluttershy with an lower voice volume. 😅"
You may need to update this…
kinda surprised logan paul isnt in here
1 thing I will never understand is how people say stuff like &quot; this is one of my hardest videos ever&quot; like what is hard about this just sit in front of the camera and make a sincere apology it is not that difficult
where was the ukelele one?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=381"">6:21</a> ‘I rehearsed this instead of just talking to you guys naturally’ That’s every day for me 😂"

I love these quaint apologies from the olden days. No ukeleles or anything.
are there any good apology video?
I havent heard of any of these people..
Shane? more like Shame
Then he didn’t come across it by random.
Wow he got kid a killed not cool.
"Uh, IDK if it is for clout but why is Pewdiepie in the description?"
"Binge-Worthy Content, Keep it up Sunny"
You should cover The Manii Show&#39;s apology since it&#39;s like the first YouTube apology that was actually good.
R.I.P to all the people who died in the Travis Scott concert. ❤
"the worst part about travis scott&#39;s mistake and apology: if he just stopped the show like people said, he could&#39;ve avoided all the deaths and injuries he caused"
Sunnyv2: huh what’s that noise?<br><br>* Ukulele starts playing*
Not me waiting for the toxic gossip train
if you have to make an apology video with another one? your done at this point lol😂
I like that everyone’s coming back to this video after Colleen Ballinger’s “apology” video. It’s the toxic gossip trainnnn
I’m so glad I don’t know who any of these people are (except Travis) and never watched their “content”. Shows me I’m on the right path in life.
All aboard!
Nah. Colleen Ballinger has a worse apology than the top 2. She’s recently made another apology for her previous apology
Why are there tears in the thumbnail? Is this click bait??? 🙃
"It&#39;s about the pursuit of truth and integrity, not the race for speed and spectacle. In our rush to be first at everything, we&#39;ve neglected the importance of truth and are inadvertently fostering a victim mentality in young people.

Great presentation.
"Every time you hear the word &#39;woke&#39;, replace it with the word &#39;representation&#39;. That, in essence, is the message.<br><br>Representation inconveniences those with authority and power and the advantageous position many find themselves in. Which is why conservatism is challenged by it (because conservatism is about protecting &#39;the way things are&#39; to those who it suits).<br><br>Dont be considerate; it will worsen your situation. Its a fine argument, but a thoroughly obviously selfish one."
Which British values? Poor people don&#39;t care? We looked at scan photos of wife&#39;s fetus (because he is old shool) and wondered what it would look like at 20months?<br>. Blimey how much does an Oxford education cost? Was it the same grooming and education  given to Frank Kitson when he wrote light insurgency...advocating polluting the waters/communities. Those poor people may need to locate their excrement at your door because of the colonial hole your history dug.

The minute they opened their mouths they went too far.
They are not afraid one of the speakers will knock that glass of water straight on that book?
"Yeah, I disagree hard with that speech. &quot;Wokism&quot; isn&#39;t  plain stupidity, just as &quot;Western civilization&quot; isn&quot;t  common sense. Try to dwell in any of both these items and you just find yourself blinded by your own light. Try to take a step further outside of the common box the next time around."
LOL! I loved these burns. This was such a fucking amazing speech
"something about him saying &#39;we would all send plumes of co2 into the atmosphere for the sake of our own children&#39;, watching everyone clap, and realising that statement roughly translates to &#39;humans care more about themselves than the planet to that extreme AND will clap for it&#39;...<br>...sort of sounds like the climate change problem in a nutshell."
"His argument is so fundamentally flawed amd juvenile. It isn&#39;t &quot;poor people&quot; that are profiting from fossil fuel extraction but the fossil fuel companies that have know about climate change since the 1970s, covered up their findings and bribed politicians to continue with the status quo. Fine if you dont care or want to believe in climate change but millions die and suffer from diseases related to the air and water pollution from fossil fuel extraction and processing but I guess that doesn&#39;t matter because it isn&#39;t sudden and in your face to see everyday. China cares about climate change as it now the market leader in solar panels, EV and other green technologies and installing more green energy capacity than any other country, but facts don&#39;t line up with the beliefs you want to hold."

yes!
Konstantin keep reminding the people&#39;s that seems fall sleep longer.

"NONE OF THIS MATTERS!  It is the SUN that is causing global climate change, and an Englishman was the first to discover this cycle. Maunder was his name, the the solar cycle which he found is called the &quot;MAUNDER MINIMUM&quot;, the latter for the period of * minimum * solar activity.<br><br>ITS ALL A FRICKING LIE, fossil fuels driving climate change is NOT TRUE."
"I was really beginning to enjoy Konstantin&#39;s speech until he got to the point where he accused the poor who, in his own words, &quot;couldn&#39;t give a shit about serving the planet.&quot; Somehow, you&#39;re right that only 2 percent is yours in UK, but we all live in one world. I wasn&#39;t born yesterday to not notice how the rich countries work. Of course, your backyard&#39;s clean because you&#39;re rich, but where did you throw your trash?<br><br>Where do you think the dirty coal that India still uses came from? Who owns those tons of crates of garbage that was thrown in Philippines? Which country&#39;s depleting Myanmar&#39;s resources and the natives are losing their land and forest right now? And don&#39;t let me even start with Congo&#39;s resources. You point your finger on the poor where their trash lives beside them but new innovations can only be used and savored by the rich."
I really love people who talk without reading from paper or teleprompter and especially if what they say make sense. It is pathetic that 99% politicians can talk only by reading written speeches.
"I feel so woke today, I can smell the coffee."
there is no woke culture no one would call the worst of an idea a culture it&#39;s just the stupid misunderstanding what the idea was the another stupid group misunderstanding everything as they usually does!
&quot;Woke culture&quot; I think he means the &quot;identitarian culture wars&quot; that right wingers started. lol
"thats the problem here! hes completely right... yet he is just talking?! since when did talking solve any problems on this planet? never!<br>actions weight more than words and what actions have been taken? ofc shouting loudly on a street is not an action.... its the same as writing this comment here!<br>you guys voted... you guys voted for the people, who have produced this outcome and now you have to carry the consequences... <br><br>but hey, somewhere in some room, some dude, speaks to other people who already know what he says! looks like for the mayority this was and still is enough!<br><br>not convinced? look at the UK these days :) also this video here has led to the current situation, since it calms people down, hearing what they think and since its 2024 and imagining things is enough and higher priority than reality, you have the UK right now as it is as the consequence... who could have thought, right? XD"
"The UK outsources most of their production, just like most 1st world countries. I assure you that the UK is responsible for more than 2% of carbon emissions. They&#39;re just funding it on different soil. So yes, there is more that could be done. But they won&#39;t because it&#39;s outsourced for the same reason the rich are not going to foot the bill for people working and creating to create CHEAP renewable energy; money. Cost and profit margins are the deciding factor. That&#39;s why we complain, because those of us working and creating will have the ideas, but most of us will never have the money to actually fund these endeavors. The people who do and who will, will do it for profit. And unless many companies with the funds globally come together and decide they&#39;re going to end world hunger, provide clean water, and provide renewable energy, that&#39;s not going to change."
It’s nice to see real men waking up we will get rid of this problem

Magnificent material for my debate class 🙏
"The Origins of “Woke”
<br>The term “woke” originated in African American communities in the United States, particularly within AAVE. It was initially used to describe someone who was aware of and knowledgeable about the systemic injustices faced by marginalized communities, especially people of color. Derived from African American Vernacular English, it emerged as a form of resistance against oppression and inequality.? <br>Disgruntled White Conservative Influences has refined WOKE into a white man&#39;s word, They could not find another word for themselves the dumb asses hahaha"
"With all due respect, this idea of &quot;we&#39;re only responsible for x% of climate change&quot; is a disingenuous practice that speaks of laziness rather than logic."
BS. Total trash definition of woke. He thinks Trump would make better leader of free world! No thank you!
"Excellent, sobering speech. <br><br>Too bad that, as Konstantin said in the very introduction, to WOKE degenerates, feelings are more important than facts, than truth."
Smart talented Traitor lic..ing Western ∆$$es
Everyime he speaks is an absolute delight and breath of fresh air. Incredible.
In his natural habitat haha nah good stuff mate!
"The pole of English politics is also greasy and bloody. Over 200 million humans died of English imperialistic colonialism&#39;s terroristic invasions and subjugations of smaller countries, just for the sake of English empire&#39;s global economic status as #1 in rank."
"It&#39;s funny that this guy is worried about Vladimir Putin as an enemy going to capitalize western cultural values. while completely forgetting that Putin is a westerner who&#39;s already using western system. <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJdqJu-6ZPo&amp;t=468"">7:48</a> He is right! You&#39;re not going to get those people to stay poor because some of those people prefer to live with simple life rather than extravagant. Otherwise, he&#39;s just projecting his own personal ideal life, which is being financially rich. But that would consequently make him wrong because he&#39;s completely disregarding those people&#39;s preference for way of living. He&#39;s the one who keeps believing that he has no agency by relying on poor people and communist government in formulating his stance on what to do with climate change because he couldn&#39;t even formulate his own individual perspective. (so much for freedom and liberty of thinking) and complaining about woke people by acting like a victim by blaming the current communist China&#39;s government while completely forgetting the fact that communism, which is Karl Marx&#39; ideology that&#39;s western ideology was adapted by China in order to not look like an enemy that would get attacked by Soviet army and simultaneously against the terroristic English imperialists&#39; threats such as the opium war that was perpetrated by barbaric British traders. The fact that this guy is relying on poor people and communist government in terms of forming his stance and using whataboutism in what to do about the climate change... is basically reveals that he couldn&#39;t even formulate his own individual perspective. So much for freedom and liberty of thinking. He also didn&#39;t really argued against the woke people&#39;s notions therefore, he failed. He tried to give the clean energ and cheap argument but completely forgot to mention that the energy is not solely the thing problem but also material garbage pollution that the western countries dominate in global contribution due to the consequent act of non-western government&#39;s defensive precaution against western terroristic imperialists&#39; threats toward those non-western countries and the transnational western trading factories in those countries for the sake of the maintenance of the supply of valuable resources necessary for the survival of English empire&#39;s global economic status as the #1 in rank."
That man is absolutely right. Have any of these WOKE protesters ever developed or invented anything to save or support the environment. Talking is the easy way and doing is the hard way.
"I used to vote liberal but they&#39;ve been taken over by the radical woke ideology, which is just another form of racism and intolerance disguised as some kind of &quot;social justice.&quot; Thank goodness we have these guys exposing them!"

"Climate change is the number one existential issue of our time. For those among us who feel the need to line their pockets or feed their egos off denying this fact, grow a brain cell. &quot;Clever&quot; fools who find humor in making light of this issue should look at the latest WEF appraisal as to the level of threat, which finally acknowledges what the scientists (even in the oil industry) have been saying for decades..."
I have watched this at least a dozen times over the past year. It gives me hope that we still have a voice in the madness

Brilliant!!!
"Oh man. - Imagine the woke agenda having to deal with Starmer&#39;s;&#39; Pro Sharia law &#39; mates,  Oh, you guys are sooo screwed."
"Oh no, he told them to work for what they wanted! They don&#39;t like that"
&quot;You&#39;re not going to get these people to stay poor.&quot;<br><br>Come to the US. It seems that people here have degrees in mooching off the welfare system. 😂
"At some point in time in our past, woke people would fill mental institutions. How did this happen?"
"The reason why a lot of poor countries have high amounts carbon emission is beacuse of their population .<br>Countries like India and China habe over a billion people while the UK just has 65 million. <br>The real difference comes in per capita emessions wealther countries and wealthier people do have  higher per capita emissions, not poor people ."
This is like that 13 year old &quot;never talk to the police&quot; video. I like to watch it a few times a year just for fun.
"All woke and dei people can freely go and live in Africa, there they will be able to pay off their “debt”, since they suffer so much from it."

&quot;It will be decided by poor people who DO NOT CARE about saving the planet&quot;<br>&quot;question&quot;<br>&quot;No thank you.&quot;<br>Epic. Don&#39;t take stupid questions when you have a point to make still.
Brilliant 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
"Thank you Mr. Kisin. Well said, Sir ! Not just Putin but WEF, The CCP.  and globalists."
Absolutely spot on!
"It is not a question of being poor, the issue is people who need money to reside paying rent. The system has reverted to possible earnings being standardized to not being enough. Then, you need to ask about China, why they are all so sane, smart, economically fine, not homeless, have culture, pay 2 dollars for clothing, and 10 dollars for phones, 40 dollars for computers, and 1000 dollars for a car."
"woke has become objective reality and now means that you buy the cheapest option versus the brand name, because technology (and AI) has facilitated the quality gap to be bridged. For example lab diamond versus real diamonds, stamped clothing versus the &quot;official&quot; clothing, rebadging items, sticker says Apple 9.0, but is a smart underneath, fly econo versus first class, take a ride-share versus buy a car, etc. on the logic that you are dumb and NOT smart if you pay 20X the price for anything that is a good enough representation of the same product because from the &quot;factory&quot; it cost 4 usd to make regardless of the brand.
<br>Woke is accelerated by technology doing increasing workloads of human jobs, this means no monthly salaries anymore, but freelance fee paid to you for the job, which AI did 80% of anyway, so 5 usd per hour is generous.
<br>Further this affects relationships among humans, where marriage was until death, increasingly it is about the 1 night stand relationship, then move on to the next, and pets (dogs and cats) have gained marriage status, being valued equal to or greater than humans to live under the same roof with.
<br>Social impact is seen, where the male is still expected to earn and pay bills, despite the same being excluded from the corporate hiring practices, relegating a man to hard labor jobs only, and a &quot;threat&quot; in the &quot;office&quot;."

"Im really appreciate the rational speaking of Konstantin, but the point is to give as much more rational  thinking,  BECAUSE  we as people need something consistent. I&#39;m coming from Earth, and believe me, it tried to kill us 100x1000 times, and you are still here is safe if you find some control. Ask some astrophysics how much impact will have some Supernova blows would like millions of years ago if we in the way. We live on this planet by coincidence and luck and you should appreciate every second we are here."
I always come back to this just to show people how woke culture really has devolved hard.
💯
A brilliant speech with a lot of good Humor 👍
Wow that man is quite a grifter 😅. Im surprised he didnt svck himself off right then and there.
"A filthy traitor is spewing lies about the country his parents were also proud to betray. But hey, when you allow traitors into your so-called establishment it tells everything about you to anyone who wants to know the truth about British."
"One point, I&#39;d argue that Climate Change would be fairly high on XJP priority list. China is a 4000 year old civilization, and XJP doesn&#39;t have to worry about ruling terms and reelection, it&#39;s stewardship of an established civilization, not the building of a new one. There is a fundamental difference in mentality there, which is important to highlight as the speaker illustrates a relatable scenario, using relatable imagery for XJP&#39;s life. <br><br>Sustainability in that context would be an underlying principle, and if one takes a look at China&#39;s adoption of sustainable measures, the reality reinforces this statement."
Like it!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJdqJu-6ZPo&amp;t=454"">7:34</a> precisely my stance on caring for the environment. People come first. Life first. Figure out climate issues in the context living an actual life that doesn&#39;t involve iron age regression"
"Woke culture should not be called like that, It gives false meaning to a term awaken. Same as homophobia, no one is affraid of gays, people mostly hate them, but they don&#39;t fear them. So basically everything about &quot;woke&quot; culture is false starting from the terminology to ithe deology. Should be called &quot;misguided&quot; culture, and  the root to this problem is deep mistrust towards autority. And this distrust snd its roots are s theme  for itself."
"Sir, please help us in America! We are unbelievably tolerant with this madness. Help!! TRUMP 🇺🇸🇺🇸💪🇺🇸🏴‍☠️"
wild west needs you to be the governor
"Not all people from other racial-grouos/cultures are interested in this stupid, nihilistic woke-garbage.<br>Russia, China, South African Nations, South American nations and others, are pushing agaist Western-liberalism.<br><br>Seriously, white-liberals think they know better than everyone else. They are completely delusional and self-righteous.🌏🤡"
Great speech.
"Very good but, he believes climate change is real?!"
"Britain, Australia, Canada, the United States have a duty to retain their identities. And the current demand that they must change, is an extension of the new demand, mandate of compliance, acquiescence, obedience, and submission placed upon us. While recognising and respecting other cultures is important, it is no more critical, and vital than our collective respect, regard, and appreciation of our own identities, our own institutional pillars, and institutions, the values and traditions that have long defined our countries, and societies, and not allow them to be deconstructed, broken down, and dismantled.
<br>
<br>It is not about intolerance, and inequality (favouritism) it is about ensuring our core values remain strong, durable and influential. By doing so we can maintain the integrity of our institutions and the cohesive fabric of our society."
Absolute bs. Says things that can easily be challenged by using actual sources and proof.
"Amazing speech. Put aside the wit and jokes, he was genuine in his promise to try and speak to the &quot;woke&quot; crowd from a position of understanding their feelings, a position of empathy, and a position of shared values of wanting the best for the world albeit from a differing angle."

I tried to leave a comment on his last post yet the people who run u tube wouldn&#39;t let my comment saying 404 server not found so I made a comment saying can&#39;t comment yet that got posted hmmmmmm free speech really we should have free speech when we agree with like this man but not the rubbish going around

"Never heard this word before 5 years ago, never heard anyone say - Sure, Bob can come along, he&#39;s always been woke! It&#39;s a bullshit word! No one used that word until some rightwing internet troll created it and dispersed it. Some young liberals took to it but it really resonates with rightwingers bc it&#39;s a way for them to talk about &quot;gays and blacks&quot; without sounding overtly homophobic or racist. It&#39;s a bullshit word."
super
"Laughter and truth matter. At least Kisin got the laughter right. Homo sapiens are defined by stories, not truth. One story has taken us further than any other. That story has changed our world to the point where &quot;we are in the fight of our lives&quot;. That story is the money story. The problem is not that we have too many left wing nutters or too many right wing nutters or too many &quot;woke&quot; people or too many religious fanatics. The problem is the money story. We need to reconstruct our money story to ensure the survival of Homo sapiens by constructing a story based on Earth&#39;s true currency - air, water, soil, biodiversity and energy. This is a monumental task. It may be that only AI can take us there. We have to recognise that we are an inseparable part of the Earth&#39;s ecosystem. This is the truth that matters more than any other. If Kisin truly cares for his son, he must face this truth now. To all of us, if we truly care for our children and their children and their children and their children, we must face this truth now."

Scott Jennings: Biden Refuted The Entire Thesis Of His Campaign On Friday
So true. Life is not fair get used to it get a hair cut get an education and get a job. Everything comes down to personal responsibility because one day you&#39;re going be standing face to face with God and held responsible whether you like it or not. And that&#39;s why socialists hate God because they don&#39;t want to be held individually responsible.

What a low-life move.  How do these people tolerate one another?   How do people tolerate themself when they know the impact something so tasteless would have?  Sick.
I’ve got a brother like the handicapped man Mr. Kisin met.  He’s a functional quad who can only push with one leg and has spastic control of one arm.  He also has severe short term memory loss.  He can’t eat by mouth and is fed by a tube.  He has a great attitude and is happy.  It is amazing!

Do we really have to lay this all out? Victim hood? Virtue signalling? Are people that lost that they don’t see this blatant over play of emotional thinking?
"So, let me tell you something, I’m blind, I work and study at the same time, and am on the way to finishing my second university degree, which will take time, but will come at one point in the next 18 months. I speak three languages fluently. I’m a certified teacher of English and give lessons in German as well. I’ve never felt I’m a victim. The only thing I feel is disappointment. I’m disappointed that people less qualified than me get 100 times more attention than I. I’m disappointed because the societal models being promoted today are based on victimhood and not on performance or merit. I have migration background, I have a disability, and none of the above has been ever used to take advantage of circumstances. Never in a job interview, for example, have I mentioned that I have these two things. All of the people I’ve talked to have shown the greatest respect for what I am and what I do, and that is a sign that I should not stop, and I won’t. That is for sure."
"I think a lot of the irony in this statement is religious people usually follow the same mindset.  This is my life because this is what god chose for me so I&#39;m just going to ride it out.  I don&#39;t disagree, It&#39;s just social media isn&#39;t the first thing to make people think this way."
"Many students want to destroy capitalism though it is the opportunity of CHOICE. Socialism is by one&#39;s needs. There is no one forcing people to purchase those things they do not need in capitalism. True capitalists understand they must say NO to the commercials, hawkers and sellers."

"Leftards<br>&quot;Climate change is bad!&quot;<br>Society<br>&quot;So do something about it.&quot;<br>Leftards<br>&quot;Hey, I like to virtue signal, I don&#39;t want to be virtuous!&quot;"
"Konstantin exactly specializes on good sounding, but misleading ideas. It is true that people play victims to get attention, but it is also true that people, and kids especially, are oppressed. They feel it, but they can&#39;t explain this properly and incorrectly rationalize this as racism and patriarchy. Just as conservatives incorrectly explain economic depression by immigration. The very fact that people have to pretend they are victims to be at least somewhat successful is exactly showing how broken out society is. There are no other ways for these kids to succeed in our world. Somebody has stolen their future along with their prospects of getting on housing ladder. Did you stole it, Konstantin, with your sweet speeches? Now you come by and essentially say &quot;you&#39;re bad people for playing victims, look at that disabled dude, you should be ashamed&quot;. I don&#39;t think you even understand how devastating and evil your message is. Fix the problem, not the &quot;bad&quot; kids who respond to the problem."
… people are taking responsibility for their own lives… by convincing others they are victims of crime. This guy retarded.
"Thats the big difference, real &quot;victims&quot; dont wanna be seen as a victim. People who wanna be seen as a victim are faking it for their own narcism"
We allowed not created! Standing in the way of these betas and masculine women is how its stopped. Back to the closets freaks!
"When I was in University about 1980 it was pro communists everywhere, while they were studying to become rich bosses."
Konstain is one of the world&#39;s great thinkers and communicaters. <br>If only GB&#39;s politicians were...
"Except this isn&#39;t a Liberal thing. Conservatives LOVE to nail themselves to the cross and do it all the time. . . ironically, with wokeism as the big bogeyman. I&#39;m no fan either (I just loathe the concept of thought policing) but they&#39;re just as if not more screechy than the woke liberals. They&#39;re literally flip sides of the same coin. Hell, both these guys have basically made a career of playing to it. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so uncomfortable for KK to talk about Ukraine, because if he&#39;s honest he&#39;s going to piss off all his subscribers. At least here in the US."
"When you cater to and caudal stupid, you will always get more of it."
"the last thing that anyone with a disability wants is for anyone to think of them as a victim, shit happened thats life they got on and dealt with it, the vast majority of these so called &quot;victims&quot; these days are just cries for attention and hustles for free handouts"
"Everyone is a victim today. I am a victim, give me money and free stuff."
So well said.
Well that just shits on everybody who has been abused and wronged in some way. Guess these people are abuser enablers?
"KK puts across Israel as victims, and they had no other real option but to kill thousands of women and children.  He is disingenuous and has an agenda, which is that the oppressed and those that are being wronged should put up and shut up, and he extends this to the UK and West.  In the west too, we have corrupt politicians who serve Zionist interests and that of their clique&#39;s above the massess.  Income inequality is at its greatest as is absolute poverty.  Otherwise, we are all in agreement that blaming the other for every single failing as individuals or as society and not taking responsibility makes matters worse."
Victims getting attention tell that to the victims of grooming gangs
We are breeeding psychopathic children ... That they are the most important thing on the planet .....
"The most determination I&#39;ve ever seen in a person comes from people with cerebral palsy. Imagine having a perfectly working brain, but your body just doesn&#39;t want to listen to it and do its own thing."
"Your statement that religion has been a bad thing in human history (your other speech), is fundamentally wrong. In the whole, religion has been a net benefit, as it has engendered morals an ethics in the human diaspora."
"The problem with rewarding, and then debasing, &quot;victimhood&quot;, is that it takes away from actual victims, those who have been systematically repressed due to their disadvantages, whether that&#39;s a disability, their skin colour, their social background, or simply down to the fact they don&#39;t have a voice in the constant clamour that is the woke far left vs the non-existent far right rhetoric.  Thus we end up with an over-privileged, brainwashed majority who think that their imagined struggles and first world problems deserve more attention and remedy than those who are victims of the generational oppression caused by the ancestral power of these privileged classes."
Dark skinned?  Maybe in Sweden.
Most real victims hate to be seen or percived like victims.
Being an oppressed victim is &quot; fun &quot; ?
Konstantin Kisin hombre.
"When you are a victim, nothing can change. It is only when you become an active participant that you can choose your path."
Wow…..what this really screwed up world desperately needs is more people like this amazing fellow Konstantin.
Was raised well by smart parents and went to exceptional schools. Took advantage of that and would like to think I spread it around. Not for me to say...
And right wingers do the same saying the leftists are ruining your world so fight them rather than finding solutions and working with each other.
"There is some truth to the social benefit of the victimhood narrative. But Jordan Peterson has earned fame and fortune telling young people to clean their bedroom and take responsibility for your life. Fortunately, most humans admire heroes (however flawed) not victims."
Jordan Peterson<br><br>Looks different 😂
"I first observed this ~ 15 years when pseudoscience conmen began to garner massive followings on social media. They offered simple, grandiose wrong answers to scientific problems that led their lazy audience to believe that everything they hadn&#39;t be bothered to learn at school was wrong anyway and they were now ahead of actual scientists because they were &#39;open-minded&#39; enough to listen to these charlatans. 15 years later that same formula used by the pseudoscience conmen is now being applied to virtually everything online."
Watch “Sound of Freedom” and see real oppression and real ‘mental health issues.’
"KK is right in principle , but there is a danger of domination of Right wing think which I do not believe is good, A big straw man with the ultra privalged Oxford students, but there are still desperate caualties in our world..  ,People in a deap hole not of thier own making , eg a child from a drug or alcohol dominated familly..  Yes some characters can beat that, at least superfiscially, but we are all of different clay and for many it is not possible ,,We must seek the middle line or ground on this , Victimhood culture widespread is certainly bad, but no victim damaged persons is also a bad way ..  WE should not allow the &quot;winners and losers &quot; to get too far apart ,, That in the long run not good for the &quot; winners&quot; or the &quot; losers &quot; .."
Lgbt ideology etc is more harmful than communism to the human being than the ussr was
Just a beautiful yet tragic sentiment of our contemporary society 😢
It&#39;s easier to fail because your the victim than trying your best and fail.Its always because of your colour or race or gender or ethnicity not because you didn&#39;t make the grade.This turns into a culture that people subconsciously or deliberately make it happen..<br>Kids from low income families and deprived areas are often brought up in homes with unemployed parents living on social handouts.These areas usually have high crime rates and having a criminal record is almost a badge of honour.. the kids are told they will never get a decent job because of where they live and attend a notorious school... with that in mind they don&#39;t care about school and have more emotional connection with the gang they run with than family..... to get the clothes and shoes ( far above the amount parents can afford) they turn to crime which gains them a police record and reduces the chance of a good job...... it&#39;s a never ending cycle that begins with being told thay have no chance of getting on because &quot;THEY WON&#39;T LET YOU&quot; ..... victims of the culture of victimisation.....
All truth can cause discomfort to the lazy thinker.
Ian Dury was very disabled and never ever complained about his situation.  He even had to be carried onto the stage sometimes because if his condition.
Konstantins suit ... 👌
"It&#39;s called positive feedback loop - get a little attention, social media amplifies the attention and now other people will subscribe to the behavior or beliefs that garner attention. Which leads to a wave of people acting in concert with stupidity."
"social validation feedback loop <br><br>As a recovering addict, out of all the drugs I&#39;ve used, or seen the effects of,<br>- the Like button is by far the worst, hands down...<br><br>No other drug has been as detrimental to society as the Social validation feedback Loop has.<br><br>- love to ALL, feel no hate"
I think one of the best speeches I&#39;ve heard!  Thankyou Konstantin.
Did this man just say “I’m dark skinned”??!!😂😂😂 Dudes as white as space ghost.
George So ros is behind most of these dysfunctional social trends.
Oooooooo9oo9ooooooooooo
When truth becomes controversial stupidity is seizing the day.
Thanks Konstantin you are an example to us all especially considering how tough you had it in your impoverished childhood and all😅
"the more attention, the more 💵💵"
I love Konstantin Kisin. He is very bright …..he really seems able to easily see the faults/weaknesses in peoples arguments.  That’s why I don’t get into those debates with people. I can’t come up with a good counter argument until an hour later 😒.  It’s frustrating. Plus I’ve internalized white guilt for years….so I just shut myself up.
"Then why are you Kostya darling allowing your beloved Ukrainian Loyalists ( I&#39;m not gonna say &quot; Nazis &quot; because MI- 6 knows I&#39;ve got Loyalist friends of my own and I love them dearly ) all the victimhood they could ever desire? Why are you peddling the &quot; Ukraine is good, Russia is pure evil &quot; garbage that insults your considerable intelligence and makes you look like a shill- not a brilliant scholar. Why are you doing this?"
I absolutely hate this but I&#39;m with Kostya 120%.
"Sometimes it feels like pulling teeth, but is sanity and common sense finally working its way back into the western world today? We need more and more people like this to come out of the shadows, grab us by the back of the neck and ram our heads into a brick wall to wake us up."
Wow
"I&#39;ve ways found the most disadvantaged people, physically and mentally disabled people, often look at themselves with the least victimhood and have the most drive. <br>Why? Because they have to be to survive. <br>The problem is woke lefties that keep on telling them they are useless and can&#39;t achieve anything by themselves."
Feeling good not the same as Being good.
True hardship builds character.
"We have done young people a great disservice over the past 50 years because we have allowed this victim mentality, and this fantasy world to develop to the point where so many people think that it’s actually real.  We now have young men walking around, thinking that they’re women. We have young actresses going around getting their breasts removed (Ellen Page) so they can look like men. We have millions of black kids who think that slavery happened because of racism. They don’t even know that in the early days of world slavery, people didn’t bring in slaves from other continents. The slaves and the slaveowners were virtually identical people. The first slaves in America were Irish. The ignorance goes on and on, and the reason it goes on and on is because the ignorance is serving a narrative."

Sheeple
so well put and explained and true
"ahahah i said exactly that, A dude or lady, (i forgot) on Subtle Asian Traits was having the second gen immigrant/early adult identity Crisis and my message to that person is essentially that: No one but yourself are the one roadblocking you into how or what you need/want to be. <br><br>Random people replying to my message like: damn you lack empathy, blabla bla. <br><br>So yeah, can relate. this happened literally this week"
"Trigfeenometry stand for free speech, unless you dare ask questions about the holocaust or even interview someone who has questions... Then you must not speak!"
Konstantin always speaks common sense a very articulate and interesting man.
F**k off whiners
Excellently put
Konstantin thinks he has dark skin? Funny. ;)
"I will never ask for your contact info in the comments section, that is someone impersonating me!"
Dudes a wokie. Can&#39;t take criticism of you know what. <br><br>It was funny to watch all these guys fall right in line. Hilarious
The emphasis in ‘freedom’ and ‘individual’ as superior western ideas is so self indulgent and culturally centric.
They will never be happy <br>They don’t consider them selves capeble
Love  Konstantine is right!<br>We created victims is a a diminishing self worth!<br>And deserves to do less<br>It is a positive to work and aspire to!<br>Communism disables. <br>Suffering we can overcome and not be <br>Victims because you have no <br>Aspiration but you have expectations <br>That’s our society has stopped functioning
We have fat homeless people. Poverty is not that.

I remember 20 some years ago I was talking to a university girl and she said she’s a victim because she’s because she’s white and rich and her dad never spent enough time with her because he was a high-powered lawyer so she’s a victim. Boo-hoo.

And they are just too unqualified for their positions."
"Woke dogma  is a mixture of Neo Marxism, black supremacism and primacy of perversion in  our culture."
Contains a huge lie from usual Russophobic Hebrew - that Putin without hesitation sent Russians into Ukraine.  That&#39;s a lie - Putin DESPERATELY tried to negotiate peace - entering into FOUR peace deals. ALL rejected by American masters and their Ukranian puppets. That&#39;s a fact.
Wasn&#39;t the &#39;life is suffering&#39; line from Scott Peck?
Our spiritual essence is more foundational than the ego
First off this would not happen if a majority of people would not take part in woke culture... Even the conservatives are woke now days... Sheeple the lot of you! When you have the sinning going on in churches you got... And the greedy that is abundantly present on the red side of things... You get the &quot;woke&quot; culture on the blue side of things... <br><br>This is not rocket science people! You want this to stop... Then stop being so woke! And actually wake up!
&quot;Woke culture&quot; i.e. regular culture is being threatened by MAGA sleep culture.
Pile of crap
I am a victim. Now show me the money..<br>Lots of it!<br>NOW!
Woke was brewed up 30 years ago the #1 intent....destroy America from within
"Chinese collectivism allows for much individualism, same way conservatives are far more tolerant of differences n don&#39;t force on their opinions. The concept embodies ultimately the idea of the cosmological self, cultivated thro society. N philosophical daoism runs parallel in influence to this, and  moves away from societal rules, so internally many chinese do not lock on to rules, they flow w what is given."
"Atheists.<br>The fool has said in his heart there is no GOD.<br>Only a fool would push gender fluidity,which is all the rave in the atheist Marxist democratic socialist community."
Tom talks too much.
Idiots are not taking over the world they&#39;ve already done it.<br>Thing about idiots they don&#39;t see whats around the corner 😂
Ah the talking heads… what is this like two cia tapped celebrities trying to make the world hunky dory?
I feel like most of these trains of thought work for the West with the exception of the West treatment of Africa and Africans globally. I’m actually amazed how much was said while completely avoiding the West brutal relationship with Africa for nearly a millennium.
KONSTANTIN BEST INTERVIEWS!!!!<br>🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️
What a great conversation. Thank You.
"Konstantin is so clear and has so much clarity in his words, he says so much using simple and few words while staying focused on the point. The host on the other hand says so little using complex words in a over drawn out babble of words that rambles on and on to the point of losing focus."
"It beats being taken over by the WEIRD RIGHT CRAZIIES who want to control how you have sex in whom you have sex with, control over women&#39;s bodies, legalize racism, and when it comes to shutting down free speech, they make the wokey left look like amateurs."
The smarter a person gets the more evil he becomes
"Just to be clear about the idea that says that is good is that which works, there&#39;s no moral content to that which works. Pragmatism is a distinctly American philosophy that has some merit; however, if that which works is evil, then that which works cannot be the good. Pragmatism (ism is a suffix for a life and worldview). If an ism is attached an idea, that idea is a philosophical assertion for truth. If something works now will it work at all times? No, it does not. That which works is often temporal and creates other problems exponentially. Pragmatism is abscessed with solving problems but never considers the long term consequence. Does that sound familiar in our government that keeps kicking the can down the road to later solve it when it creates a more serious problem. <br><br>Sorry people but life is going to be difficult and no amount of that which works is going to ultimately solve those problems. That means we are continually responding to problems created a previous problems that created several more problems.<br><br>Now for this super structure idea, that is way over simplified. To have some value are sacred then that value must be eternally true. If a value is only of human preference, it will not ever be an ultimate value. All values must be measured by an ultimate source that has the power to enforce those values ultimately. If there is no consequence ultimately, then all values are temporal and I may pursue my own personal interest and use any means to attain it. If the wicked prosper then wickedness works, right? Then again if there is no ultimate value then good and evil do not exist. That which works has many avenues for that which is good. The good is that which humans say is good."
All of these woke ideas inclusion victimhood feeling good at all costs without actually being good. They all stem from the women being raised to positions of power they will give up the fight for what is right for what is feels good every time. To women the only thing that matters is don&#39;t be mean which means don&#39;t tell the truth don&#39;t look at problems don&#39;t point out anything that&#39;s abnormal. We&#39;re all in this together we&#39;re all love we need to cherish each other&#39;s experience. And none of this absolutely none of it as a position in the hierarchies of our society. These ideas are meant to be at home in our families and carried out into the world and used in the decision processes for doing battle in business or life these are the underlying values that make us human they are not values that you can lead a society success. Running a society with these values will lead to failure and destruction and dominance by others.
"The problem with pseudointellectuals like this guy is that they&#39;re actually much more concern about sounding smart with their righteous-English language but  they ends-up failing because they&#39;re simultaneously ignoring their target enemy&#39;s different perspective and motivation that generates the narrative.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXEnSX_aRRE&amp;t=875"">14:35</a> The problem with that individualist&#39;s &quot;you matter&quot; is the fact that the Christianity&#39;s scapegoatism is still being use by those individualistic people by treating the other &quot;perceived-incompetent&quot; as the &quot;obvious&quot; sacrifice through torturing the target with social condemnation.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXEnSX_aRRE&amp;t=128"">2:08</a> The only reason why you feel that &quot;this kind of thing is going to arise at certain times in history&quot; is because of the immature western culture, which is the byproduct of the failure of western civilization to developed sophisticated collective therapeutic spiritual disciplines in the long-term... because of the destructive geopolitical influence of the Dark Ages."
Woke people are not using weaponized empathy because they don&#39;t care about empathy because they&#39;re actually being pretentious concern toward the other people people that they perceived to &quot;deserve better&quot;. It&#39;s narcissistic compassion that is driving their motivation.
Kisin the clown will not be taking anything over.

"I feel like woke culture is draining me of my soul, as much as the society of the 2020s."
watching from Arizona.
question for konstantin: did the suicides of prison guards take place immediately after the death of stalin or after the khrushchev &quot;secret speech&quot; 3 years later? i&#39;ve read solzhenitsyn and he seems unclear on the point.
"Zionism is more dangerous than Nazism because: You cannot distinguish who is a Jew and who is a Zionist. Who is playing offer who is Zionist.<br>They exploit the Holocaust card and the antisemitism card. Christian Zionists claim they are helping Jews. Christian Zionism is an extreme ideology that supports Israel, seeing it as fulfilling biblical prophecy for Jesus&#39;s Second Coming, Armageddon, and the judgment of non-Christians. Jewish Zionists say they are a minority, and the majority of Zionists are Christian. Very few people have the time to understand what Zionism truly is. The power of Zionism lies in its ability to corrupt representatives in Western countries with money, making them support the colonialist state and even banning TikTok from criticizing Israel. Zionists have big control over media, from newspapers to radio, TV, YouTube, and Facebook. Israeli Zionists kill and attack any place in the West and then retreat to Israel. Zionists can ruin your career almost anywhere in the West by labeling you as antisemitic."
Really good episode. Thank you
We are seeing the cons of democracy. It great but once fools take charge counties and empires fall

"What is not working is bringing on poverty to all America--we do not have it so good  and it is getting worse, not better.  Poverty is reality and all your woke talk doesn&#39;t  make anything better."

Like watching two blind guys play darts What is this &quot;spark of divinity&quot; ?  And the idea behind the constitution is not unnatural in the slightest . Think of   A father and his children and you will understand
Bilyou claiming he knew lots of people who were poor is ridiculous - &quot; I was a big brother to a kid that lived IN Compton&quot; =   LOL  First of all Compton is not poor and I&#39;m not sure it ever was - I moved there as a teen for a brief period and what amazed me when I got there is how much money they had (nasty people and poverty of the soul - yeah that&#39;s a different story)  secondly he is not old enough to have seen it at its worst.  It was way better by the time he was old enough to be a Big Brother.<br>Pretty much everybody from major urban areas has never seen real economic poverty or poor people

"I was looking for this video earlier, and found the flipside version of it with Tom on Triggernometry. That one was fantastic. I was going back to listen to it again and this one popped up."
"There needs to be equality of opportunity. However, the issue is that the idea of a meritocracy is being abandoned in favour of social engineering. A DEI actor doesn&#39;t necessarily have talent or charisma. An all female cast is not a recipe for on-screen magic. An all-black games studio is not guaranteed to produce good games. Individual aspects like talent, imagination and charisma are crucial as well as the personal will to hone skills and gain experience over many years. This is all being cast aside in the name of forced equality. This tide must be turned before it ruins us. The western entertainment industry is probably beyond saving now but the rot is spreading. Do you want a heart surgeon that knows what they are doing or are you happy with a diversity hire? There is already talk of hiring airline pilots on the basis of diversity quotas......"
No other state played the victim role like the Jewish. People got killed by the millions during the human history.

"It&#39;s no mystery that some can be sacrificed - there are never a shortage of conspicuous antisocial people. But Stalin&#39;s problem was an inability to reflect on the difference between his first victims, and the kulaks, his later manufactured victims."

"I know this will be an unpopular comment and will get me mocked but...<br><br>When talking about covid and its said that it wasn&#39;t that spreadable, it wasn&#39;t a big deal, it was about authoritarian behaviour etc, this is a poor take in my opinion.<br><br>My wife and I observed the rules. We stayed in. We didn&#39;t mingle. We got through about 1.5 years covid free. We then went out to london one night. Our first night actually going somewhere congested with no mask or anything. We travelled by train on the saturday and travelled home on sunday. On Monday we both had covid. Not one of us, it was both of us. That is a spreadable disease/illness/sickness or whatever. We don&#39;t know how we got it. Was it from a person? The hotel we stayed in? Something we touched? Impossible to know. Now of course you may argue the effect of covid. For a few days we felt terrible. Could&#39;t sleep, eat etc. But we got over it, we didn&#39;t die. However, when it first happened in the world people were, supposedly, dying. So you take the fact that yeah, something spreads via all sorts of unknown means and it can potentially kill you. What do you do?<br><br>If you own a shop and there is an issue with a gas leak, you know its going to have a terrible effect on people exposed. You might die, you might not. But you know its there and you need to make sure your people are safe. Do you send them home to keep them safe and away from danger until the issue is resolved or do you make them go home and be safe while you fix it? the former is the obvious choice even if you are responsible for only 2-3 people. Government is responsible for protecting millions and billions.<br><br>At the time I feel the governments, who we like to say are responsible for our safety (thats not deniable, we expect government to serve us and ensure we get what we need to survive and uphold how we expect our country to be maintained) made the sensible choice. It was a difficult time where none of us would know what to do. Its fine to look back and say &quot;i would have done this&quot; but would you? When you are in it, its a different matter and most of us do not know the feeling or pressure of being responsible for billions of people."
So many times KK starts interviewing Tom 😆 great video!
I LOVED this conversation!
"Funny how Tom thinks he has seen poverty up close.. and proceeds to describes a home, refrigerator and air conditioning but bad neighborhood 😆 cracks me up. This is definitely the description of poverty in the USA. For most parts of the world this description is an upper middle class. I was born and raised by a single mom in a room that was our bedroom, kitchen, living room &amp; bathroom with no refrigerator or AC. Anyways... whatever your definition of poverty is, the truth is WE CAN ALL GET OUT OF IT, BETTER OURSELVES &amp; CONTRIBUTE TO THE WORLD . ✌️♥️<br>Thank you TOM for sharing this with us."
It all boils down to wealth inequality and corruption. People just don&#39;t know what to point their fingers at.
"The best analogy I have seen: many progressives have Munchausen’s syndrome, or Munchausen’s by proxy. America is like the child who was being poisoned by her mother in the movie Sixth Sense. The mother gets addicted to the attention and sympathy she gets for seeming to be a “caring” figure. So addicted that she ignores the fact that she is hurting the child, killing her ultimately. The poison is wokeism and DEI. It has not proven to be effective; if anything it’s been proven to be the opposite, destructive even. The mother is all the progressives, academics, and people who are addicted to the attention, sympathy, and other benefits (academic, professional, social, and otherwise) that they get for either claiming to be oppressed, or advocating for others who fit that description. They have total disregard for the consequences; in fact they have, through cancel culture, shut down any discussion, much less debate. People respond to incentives; it’s almost understandable in that context. But given the hysteria, and the destructiveness to our society, it’s time to push back."
I&#39;m a Christian and a recently graduated chaplain from college. This forum needs to be heard in the faith based community
"&#39;men need sex to feel loved and women need love to have sex&#39;<br>I imagine men don&#39;t feel loved since becoming the boon of western society jokes, hence porn addictions?"
All men are created equal does not equate to every human having divinity. That is a twisting of the Christian teaching that all men are created in the image of God which does not equal divinity.<br> That is an old Christian heresy from the time of the early Christian church. It is because the US stopped being protestant but kept parts of the teaching which allowed it to come back as neo-gnosticism.
"I just realized how different the rest of the west is from the USA in relation to the <a href=""http://left.in/"">left.In</a> most other western countries the real left is low income workers with a few highly educated members and some college students.The bulk of it is mostly working class that struggles everyday.And the workers certainly ain&#39;t <a href=""http://woke.so/"">woke.So</a> their main reason for being left is entirely different than the USA.Anyways, watched hundreds of hours of JP,Murray,Haris etc etc,and ll of em have character flaws.But Kisin....I cant find any faults to his character,he has become my favorite very fast."
"IF TOM SOWELL IS SO LEGIT THEN GET HIM ON YOUR SHOW. HE&#39;s 93!!! Cummon guys, stop ducking him. How many times has Kneel Tyson been on Rogan? TOM SOWELL HASN&#39;T BEEN ON ROGAN ONCE!!! Get Tom Sowell on your show!"
Look how many lawsuits the left have against Donald Trump an ex President who is running against the current administration for election. This is unprecedented election interference and persecution of a political opponent.
and that is why i reject most christians. they wont or cant be soldiers or warriors ..unlike the evil islamics ..i suggested merging the two cults but it didnt get any traction.
and if you know its my coffin and Gay the Devil put a hell programme into the sphere that runs it you know why evil [God] is so much stronger than any number of good men...what then? you are right being moral is good. but under HIM it makes you food.  the only possible recourse is battle.
yes the pendulum is wildly unbalanced.  Gay always chose Tragedy but i chose Comedy. now he is beaten but the CIA is determined to make me crash. so i think we will wind up with a really off the wall surreal kafka or dostoevski.
Sensitivity is the millennials drug
"Kisin has hit the nail on the head about what differentiates the west from all other cultures - individualism / individual liberty / individual freedom. It has taken the west quite far. But I think this idea is running on fumes now.<br><br>The better system is to have individual rights AND duties. Rights without duties will lead to anarchy. <br><br>And the reason why such anarchy is only rearing its head in the west now is because, for the past 100 years, people inherently understood the importance of taking responsibilities, even though no one was shoving on them. But now, people have forgotten the importance of taking responsibilities along with the rights given to them by their society."
Incredible guest! He and Jordan Peterson have been thee best so far!
It is weaponized!
"Tom, if life is simply an accident of chemical reactions then by definition there is nothing &quot;sacred&quot; about life. You can&#39;t have it both ways."
Konstantin talks about Russians fighting wars for the monarchy. Who the hell does he think the American military is fighting war after war after war for? These are clearly imperialist wars fought by the poor for the rich. Konstantin might be an expert on Russia but he&#39;s got a lot to learn about the west.
Social media needs to go
"The way to deal with woke people is to refuse to converse with them on their terms, just tell them you will only talk on your terms, then you control the situation and no one needs to be offended by anything said, if the other person refuses this, just politely excuse yourself from their company."
The error is in assuming theyre bright minds because they go to Oxford lol. they are the most brainwashed that i would agree
It all starts at school you brainwash them when they are young and naive because they will believe anything you tell them it’s called indoctrination wake up
I love Konstantin.
"That woman who keeps shouting at the panel should have been removed has no manners at all, she is route."
Year later its got alot worse
The youngs are worth an effort
"Communism was exported to Russia by ex leaseholders,now the West is trying again."
"what I loathe the most is that the woke call people racist or nazis very quickly, which is a very harsh insult. but somehow that&#39;s ok."
I bet he gives a toss about poor people in Asian countries. This guy must have connections with the oil industry.
If he can be called a &quot;satirical comedian&quot; wtf is that bloated gasbag across from him?
How can someone speak English like that when it&#39;s his second language?
"How have we got to this place?, a great question"
Wt bloody f was that <b>bing</b>
"I am a big fan of this guy but the &quot;only 2% Co²&quot; argument is bogus , Why ? Because if advanced nations show you can prosper without burning much carbon fuel, and can also prove it is a superior econömy in cost , which many believe to be the case, then that is the goal.. ,As a successful example.. Too many can only immagine the change to renewables as be a loss situation and that is not reasonable, that is not the case, .. Not te mention national security of energy independence ."
"Young people, ask yourself why leaders would listen to a young girl, Greta that hasn&#39;t live long enough to know what size bra she needs to buy??  Please consider that the elite are wanting to eliminate many poeple by taking away low cost  energry.  But the Elite will not volunteer to give themselves as a sacrifice for global warming!!"
Woke = Fascist
Used your voice your talent so that people&#39;s  knew the truth .
Arrest Soros
Why do you have to be reasonable with people that are the most unreasonable the world has ever seen?
Highly INTELLIGENT Mr. So DAMN true !!!!
"An old army mate of mine who did two tours of Malaya and two of Vietnam (including with the AATTV) experienced a severe PTSD episode at a cinema during the ambush scene in Forrest Gump, which required him receiving assistance to leave the cinema. Then you get complete farquewits like these two, who&#39;ve led soft-arsed privileged existences, preaching to everybody else about what they shouldn&#39;t be triggered by. Go farque yourselves with a shared carrot, you small-minded wankers."
Uh...capacity
"Konstantin is sooooo right, on every aspect he considers. Thruthfull honest thinking capaity. Brilliant analyzer. No ego-lead person. Just in search of the truth and coming up with real solutions. Independent thinker."
Rich men discusing partial segism in society so they can get the attention of women on socal media.Setting unrealistic expectations to women
"If you can&#39;t take a comedic fact, you will definitely not swallow a straight-up fact down your throat."
Next thing you know NASA comes out and says there&#39;s evidence that beings lived on Venus but they created their own global warming and therefore that&#39;s why Venus is as deadly and inhospitable today lol.
"You do not have to defeat the woke people  just ignore them, Stupidity always disappears over time so no problem."
"Its not the woke mentality alone, it is the right&#39;s inhibiting the very progress he apparently champions. Perhaps he&#39;s too young to remember  Jimmy Carter and putting the symbolic solar panels on the roof of the white house. Symbolizing the need for progress, the very progress Kisin  proclaims in this speech, was undermined by the Reagan Administration who as his first act in office was to remove this very symbol of progress now we are 40 years behind and then to defund the departments that worked to enhance clean energy. Don&#39;t blame wokism nor the poverty in South America and Asia, blame the right leaners for destroying progress which put the US 40 years behind the 8 Ball. While wokism has its issues the right is the true cancel culture of alternate energy. They weren&#39;t around during the failed Reagan administration."
That selfie sealed it 🤦‍♂️ Konstatin is a right GRIFTER! Piers left ITV on his own …. What a pair of Karens! Woke and Anti-woke are profiteering off stupid views!
A Brit and a Russian defending America.  That’s how f’ed up we are.
So woke people don&#39;t work...of course not...only you works! LOL
"The generations that complained non stop about gay people, about other religions, about single mothers, about pretty much everything now SURPRISE SURPRISE complains about the younger generations LOL"
If you externalize your emitssons to poor people countries then it is easy to say you are not responsible for the emissions I guess.

He&#39;s a bright man
The problem is the Woke don’t understand that they have corrupted their own brains. They don’t even see themselves as Woke and try to dismiss being called woke by saying it’s old and stupid. Just call them Neo-Woke that got corrupted from their original goals of working towards a common good for the oppressed and under represented  to hateful fascist racist for their own power.
The nice thing about this is that it gives you the hope that maybe the world won&#39;t turn into an insanely perverted place because of the woke.  It&#39;s terrifying.
"Question: why do we not offer to send (these so-called woke people), them to a country that better represent what the want, and offer that country (China, Russia and any other socialist and fascist country) a swap, we will take the ones who want to live in a democratic and free country."
this is the nest thing I&#39;ve heard in ages...!
"Ehhhh, wait a minute, you shouted down Tommy Robinson when he talked about the Qu&#39;ran, you didn&#39;t want to hear what he had to say, you just yelled at him Piers..."
Aware of political and social injustices...especially racism!<br>Finish the definition Piers!
Konstantin Kisin if you see this i think you are great!
Wokery jokery needs a boot pokery.
$70 a month just to read their content is a bit rich!  Trig are making a bloody fortune on the back of their anti Wokeness.  A bit like Meta I guess.
‘Basically are a form of fascist😂😂’
"if we abide by extreme left wing views and policies along with extreme right wing views we are in trouble - AND YES you left wing followers you are as bad as the right wing ,,,PS sorry piers you believe in god - religion is another extreme we could do with out"
It was a brilliant speech but the bone he threw them is based on a lie
Quite bigoted to the like of Piers and Kisin himself to abuse &#39;woke&#39; people. Do they even exist? Can someone seriously say that they subscribe to the &#39;woke&#39; mentality? Projection.
A brilliant speech by any standards. Thanks Konstantin.
great speech
I question climate change. Car&#39;s get the blame and hammer for climate change however very little is said of planes. Holiday makers around the world including cruising gets a free pass
"Thank You Piers Morgan for once again proving that your Channel is the place of safety, normality and comfort for the number of ordinary people that suddenly in todays world hsve been left outside and dont have many other spaces or just a home like this one-the home of freedom and logic in general factual thinking and intelligent and kind but powerful discussions.<br>So important today-in this overwhelming run of information and completely subjective, repeatedly blind against the ones of others and often aggressive and totally new or baseless narratives from multiple sides.<br><br>Thank You Mr. Piers Morgan and Mr. Konstantin ❤️👏💡<br>We all feel good being able to listen to such smart and educated adults but also and first of all just the non populistic and reflecting the common sense people 👍"
"i used to do drugs.  i still do, i just used to, too!"
As someone from eastern europe who also dealt with communism until a few 3 decades ago this is what the western world doesnt realize.<br><br>They dont realizes how dangerous this insane censorship can get because these idiots dont actually know what it means to actually live under an opressive government.<br><br>These phucken losers believe being mosgendered is opression for example
"The main thing is to save  energy! Ever thought of that? ?  Begin with private air condition at home, or in cars. Move your asses, instead of takin the car. Etc.."
"The idea that we are ruining the world is an old one.  Even the Bible in Revelations, God said he would destroy those &quot;ruining the Earth&quot;.  The problem is the way the &quot;woke&quot; crowd decides to do it.  The fact is that they don&#39;t have real power to enact change, they have no actual vote.  They can pressure companies to go along for a short time, but those companies will never change the fundamental core of how they pollute just to please this generations loud hippies.<br><br>  Of course if the world doesn&#39;t act, they can&#39;t complain if God does return to save us from ourselves, right when we are about to go extinct for not stopping the global damage to the planet.  I&#39;m not sure if it will happen in my lifetime, but so far the world is getting worse, more pollution can not be a good thing.  The Earth is finite and it can&#39;t take an infinite amount of abuse without there being consequences."
Loved his speech when I saw the whole of it. Another great interview Piers.
People don&#39;t ever acknowledge how perceptive a comedian has to be to create a routine.
Piers is still kind of an ass though … Declaring where Konstantin is going to film HIS OWN show.
"My name is Mahyar Radmehr, charged in August 2023 and facing 5 years in prison in Canada for having created a website exposing a female serial accuser by the name Sheida Khosroshahi with legally obtained documents who has charged and displaced men since 1997..Run the name sheida khosroshahi on Google  and see for yourself."
"Also, the Internet doesn&#39;t help by spreading this type of nonsense."
"Compare the brilliance of his speech in its entirety, with the several hundred televised versions of Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion word salad offerings - as nutritious as a can of spam or a box of kraft dinner. <br>Konstantin Kisin is a remarkable example of a true and powerful cultural diversity, the kind that made the west through most of the 20th century such a cornucopia of freedom of thought. <br>Great discussion, guys. Only wish it had extended longer. Needs another round or two."
It’s an amazing reality that the best comedy is the ridiculous Truth.  That’s why liberals fear memes.
"Piers Morgan always complains about the woke culture, yet he went super woke with Tommy Robinson about Islam. I have never heard him criticize how the woke culture empowering Islamic terrorism, not only towards the West, but towards Muslims and former Muslims who are part of the Islamic world even if they left it and are still a persecuted minority. Even in the UK by their Muslim families. Piers Morgan is either afraid of Muslims or he is a hypocrite"
"The problem with these types of free speech idiots is they take no personal responsibility for what they say. Most are really dumb, wokeness is about the equality of all, including speech, thought, expression and existence. It is not about cancelling, unlike these numbskulls advocating a few grifting words."
"The &#39;cleanest&#39; energy source ever devised is that derived from fossil fuels. It&#39;s staggering how brainwashed we&#39;ve become, demonizing carbon, carbon! the constituent element of all life on Earth! And to achieve the asinine goal of &#39;net zero&#39;  carbon emissions we&#39;ll chop down ALL trees, severely reduce arable land devoted to agriculture, relocate rural populations to  cities ... It&#39;s astonishing how destructive such plans are to Earth&#39;s environment, and it&#39;s being done deliberately."
"The first thing you have to do, is recognise your enemy.  WHO, is not only responsible for introducing it, BUT, who is feeding this sickness? And take it from there."
"Republicans criticize their own side a lot! Too much! As Rush used to say, “Democrats circle the wagons and Republicans shoot their wounded.”"
It will be interesting when these people get into the work place and start running for politics and change try to laws to meet their beliefs and realize it is not that easy.
We will absolute defeat wokeness.
"It&#39;s a cultural revolution, Maoism with western elements."
"people who dont believe in their selves ,ussualy go for some woke group of people to feel better ,but they cant see that theyre just brainwashed and lost ,my message love youre self and believe in yourself and you will look alot better in others eyes ,dont sell your soul to self loving people who wants world to bend"
Now after all that What are they going to do in the meantime  how many years will it take  all countries  will have to  be together about this A real challenge
Brilliant makes sense really impressed
"Wokeness, hopefully will be all gone within 4-5 years."
"If you go woke you go broke and stupid, not logical thinking, not an individual thinking is just have one learn speach that you repeat all over with no  opinion of your own cuz this is not your idea is a bad route that make you belive you are a victim and that you have to love just like that amd not try to be better just cry over all and mekw the rest equally stupid to follow. No thanks i like my brain and critical thinking."
The West is becoming far left. The communist Bolsheviks are in power. <br><br>Unless their is a reincarnation of Adolf Hitler it&#39;s going to get worse
🎉Thank You!!! YES!! Post Woke!! YES!! Pretty Stupid!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🤩
Can’t wait for that collaboration between the two of you 🙌🙌🙌
Human gas is loaded with greenhouse gases.  For God’s sake….STOP FARTING!!!
The woke mob are communists/ Marxists. Plain and simple.
Konstantin is fighting against the woke culture and therefore he deserves everyone&#39;s supports for that matter.
He is saying Latin America and Asia are responsible for environmental issue. Hope this idiot gets some history lesson with fact. Your so-called west manufacturing is done in Asia and Latin America.
Woke will destroy itself. Fanatics always do. Just a question of how many they take down with them...
He the of the bat that poor people couldn&#39;t give a f about saving the planet. The audacity.
"keen insights, robust arguments and irrefutable logic"
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
guy looks like the anoerexic vladimir klitschko
Great debate!
"Morgan is crying woke because people like him no longer have absolute monopoly of the media like before.<br>People now can freely express their own view on social media and be heard unlike when the MSM had absolute power to control people’s mind.<br>He’s not used to being challenged or opposed to, opposing his views easily translates to being CANCELLED.<br>Megan merkel issue and the Ukrainian-Russian war is an example of that."
"There&#39;s such a Sinister feeling to it all. And I always wondered who funds these people where do they get their money? Someone has to pay for transportation, t-shirts signs bull horns. Follow the money who funds them? I&#39;d love to know <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voMaVTqL1OQ&amp;t=367"">6:07</a>"
"More and more everyday, all those rumors I heard about a new world order seem to be materializing right before my eyes. It is so obvious that the self-appointed ruling class leftist activist and they&#39;re poor victimized voters that have been lied to for decades. Thanks for speaking out you&#39;re a wonderful sensible man. You&#39;re okay to pierce wink <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voMaVTqL1OQ&amp;t=278"">4:38</a>"
"I noticed this was posted 4 months ago. Is this wonderful man still around? Or have the leftist destroyed him yet😢 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voMaVTqL1OQ&amp;t=94"">1:34</a>"
I support the speakers on educating youth rather than demonizing them. Woke culture has done nothing but harm. I do disaree with the comment on carbon footprint though. The reason why Asia and South America are responsible for high carbon emission is because North America and Europe has shifted majority of their production to these countries for reduced cost.
He seems woke to me an activist discussing a practical solution to climate change
"Republicans want to control where you shop, where you eat, what you can buy, what to think and who you can make live to. It is 1930’s Germany."
You can’t defeat something if you don’t even know what it is or should even be defeated.
"I&#39;m not woke, but I&#39;m a leftist. And he&#39;s spitting bullshit that only morons would actually take for facts. First of all, making changes to the way we consume is what would bring positive climate change, the west is the biggest consumer of Chinese products. So the West is indeed responsible for China being the biggest polluter in the world. And if the West had any good intentions, they would boycott products that are not responsibly produced. And that would actually make China prosper even more as they can start selling these products at higher margins. These studies that show the biggest polluters in the world don&#39;t take into account when a country contributes to another countries pollution. For example, the biggest consumer of Chinese products is the US. Therefore, the US should be considered the biggest polluter and not China."
"Thank You So Much For Watching And STAAAY BLESSED :)<br>If You are interested in my book full of short stories it is available now !<br><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPQYT3WH"">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPQYT3WH</a><br><a href=""https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0BPQYT3WH"">https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0BPQYT3WH</a>"
"We in the UK have ABSOLUTE MORAL OBLIGATION TO LEAD SUSTAINABILITY /GREEN REVOLUTION. BRITAIN STARTED INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, HAS APPROPRIATED MUCH MORE THAN MOST COUNTRIES OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES THAN MOST COUNTRIES SINCE THEN, DESTROYED MUCH MORE TOO, AND IS WASTING ITS POTENTIAL ON CREATING BXXSHIT ECONOMY, VIRTUAL ECONOMY, ON MINDLESS CONSUMERISM."
"My theory is they tell us it&#39;s hotter, we think its hotter, and so it gets hotter.<br><br>We are programmed to manifest these temperatures. We create those temperatures with our thoughts."
How is climate change &quot;woke culture&quot;????
"Fuck the planet! (GB is 2% of TODAYS emissions, amazing how he forgets how they got RICH."
That&#39;s why wizards that will figure out how to make clean energy cheaply are greater than the prophets that prescribe inefficient protesting.
most important speech in the last 6 months ever!
"This should be shown to the New Zealand government.  And ex Prime minister Jacinda Ardern.  She tried to be St Greta of Thundaberg greatest campaigner, companion. Stupid b#$ch. So many people lost jobs , and they imported crap stuff from overseas cos it was cheaper."
This guy knocks it right out of the park… Superbly spoken….
The music is disturbing.
"Laughter and truth matter. At least Kisin got the laughter right. Homo sapiens are defined by stories, not truth. One story has taken us further than any other. That story has changed our world to the point where &quot;we are in the fight of our lives&quot;. That story is the money story. The problem is not that we have too many left wing nutters or too many right wing nutters or too many &quot;woke&quot; people or too many religious fanatics. The problem is the money story. We need to reconstruct our money story to ensure the survival of Homo sapiens by constructing a story based on Earth&#39;s true currency - air, water, soil, biodiversity and energy. This is a monumental task. It may be that only AI can take us there. We have to recognise that we are an inseparable part of the Earth&#39;s ecosystem. This is the truth that matters more than any other. If Kisin truly cares for his son, he must face this truth now. To all of us, if we truly care for our children and their children and their children and their children, we must face this truth now."
Konstantin is one of the great men
It’s Sherlock!
"At the 4 minute mark, why did you edit the speech.  In his actual speech, after he said that “about 15 months ago my wife got pregnant”, he followed that with a comical line that she got pregnant, not him, because they are old fashioned.  What’s wrong with that statement?  People in the hall laughed, I did too.  It’s strange that someone edited the line out."
"so if I am going to distill his argument down, it would read something like, fix poverty through technology and that will do a lot to curbing the advance of what he perceives as the negative effects of climate change?  Am I hearing him right and not getting myself all confused?  great....then he better hope that technology helps us skip the step where the poor of china and India get cheap cars....In the extraordinarily short history of the human race when have technological breakthroughs EVER been either CLEAN or CHEAP?   This is a load of bollocks.  I am nearly 50 and I have no love lost for the woke or the asleep, or the right/left, or the republican/democrat.  it is all just a diversion and division tactic if you were to ask me, but this speech is not so much inspiring as it&#39;s a load of bollocks"
I&#39;ve seen this great speech many times. You need to turn the music down. It&#39;s distracting. Thank you.
Unnecessary annoying stupid music. We don’t need to be manipulated. Grow up.
Please leave out the stupied music when you post...annoying and distracting.
This Speak should every Buddy alert that we all fight the same fight about survival.
"This is what intelligence sounds like, for those of you who have never heard the sound before...Listen close, very close and free your mind so that your butt can follow."
A shame about the annoying soundtrack someone decided to put under it. Wtf???
"the gay totally misses the point. To say that someone else is doing wrong does it mean we can do it as well? If others engage in wars all over the world and people will die anyway does it mean we can do it? And more importantly, by putting pressure and fighting for decorbanization, we force investors and scientis to work faster on technological progress."
"Why did you cut the harmless joke, „About 15 months ago my wife got pregnant. Not me, cause we&#39;re old school&quot;, you want people to watch the video but you censor it yourself, that&#39;s pathetic :-)"
&quot;THE SPEECH THAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT&quot; - did it &#39;break the internet&#39;  LMAO
"NUKE  THE  EARTHS CORE AS WE DID IN 45 56? HOPE THIS HELPS  AND 63 CAUSING THE MANTLE TO CRACK ALLOWING THE COLD OCEANS TO COOL THE PLANETSS CORE .WE THEN HAD THE FREEZING WINTERS OF 45 56? AND 63,THIS LATEST TEST FROZE THE SEA AROUND THE UKs COAST. WE THEN HAD A SLOW CLIMB IN CLIMATIC HEAT  PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE PLANETS 23.5 AXIS TILT. Ihope this helps you scientists that do not understand the earths relentless evolution.   Bob."
"&#39;&#39;Smash that Button&#39;&#39; what a powerful statement, so true having been in poverty and raising a child."
"Great video, but I couldn&#39;t focus on the music because that idiot in the background kept talking! Please turn the music volume way up in future videos 🙏"
"it&#39;s called priorities and young people don&#39;t have them....they have ideas of others branded into them, but they will wake up...and when they do....depression, drugs/sex addiction and suicide awaits them because they&#39;ve learned nothing on their own and have been shielded from safe suffering which every child needs to become resilient, strong and successful. The last 2 Gen&#39;s have been destroyed by left insanity posing as virtuous. Sad times."
What a bright person.. Wonderful... All young people should be hearing this ebety month st school👍
"Im 52, and still will never bring a child of my own into this world!<br>Why would i want my child to suffer because of others!?"
"People in western countries dont understand how many tires are burnt in certain countrie every single day going up into your air,and the reason they do it, yup,its because they are poor looking for what WE THE PEOPLE of the planet throw away!!!<br>Not one person is even close to being awake!!!"
So so so sad this only has 2 million views. Soooo sad.
DAMN GOOD SPEECH
Shut the music off. Very distracting.
One the most inspiring and truth filled speeches I&#39;ve heard in my lifetime  !! ❤❤
That was deep..... really DEEP 👏👏👏👏
Liar. Complete and utter obfuscation.
"I sit back and wait to see when the world will waken up and do what they don&#39;t want to do, which is to change! I don&#39;t want to sit back, I want to stand up with the people and change, but I fear I&#39;ll always be in the same position, sitting back, waiting to see when the world will waken up and do what they don&#39;t want to do!"
"The world is at the apex of selfishness. <br>😢😢😢<br>Here in America, people don&#39;t even know how programmed they are to be selfish.<br>i.e.,,,,,<br>Cars almost never give the pedestrian the right of way.<br>In one of the richest counties in the USA. <br>Trump will be re-elected. <br>He is already courting hard line right wing fascists.<br>But I believe that God is allowing this mess until the time that HE will end this. 😢😢😢"
I argue that a third of India do not live in India at all but live in New Zealand
"I appreciate what this man says. I don’t believe in Climate Change and Never Will. For you all who let the music bother you, or think this man doesn’t know what he is doing ~ please rethink and find some common sense!"
Who is this man?
"Powerful speech! I wish if he mentioned something about the starvation &amp; Holocaust in Gaza concentration camp, and the ecocide going on due to the American &amp; European weapon &amp; bombs used."
What a waste if time listening to this man of little knowledge and about growing up
Climate change is a hoax of the US  and European. They destroyed huge acreages of trees everywhere and now want the underdeveloped countries to not do the same as they did
"Brilliant speech, should be compulsory viewing in every Australian university, and on continuous playback in Parliament House"
Good ones
"Please switch off the awful music, I can barely hear what he&#39;s saying."
"The GOD I love, the Creator of our Universe is the only one that can allow this planet to exist without any human interference. He alone will control this universe."
The woke care more about “feelings” more than “the truth.” Lol.
The music is insipid as is this man who knows who he is selling this hogwash to. No facts no knowledge. Low grade sludge fuel used in maritime transportation is one of the huge factors in air pollution for instance.
Common sense.
"Why did you delete his line &quot;Not me, because I&#39;m old school&quot;, referring to his wife&#39;s pregnancy?"
"Great speech, indeed! While I hope deep down that by some miracle it will have an effect on zombies who make up the woke community, all the facts at hand tell me it&#39;s a waste of time... you might as well hold this speech in a forest, with the trees, the effect would be similar... Brilliant man, though."
I can’t understand how such nonsense could appeal to so many people. What he says is a real manipulation of public opinion<br><br>￼

Why would you make the music so loud you can&#39;t hear the speaker?
"Did the Oxford bring in a rebuttal? Otherwise, &quot;Debate Club&quot; really misinforms one in the English language. My wife and I, &quot;Boomers,&quot; never brought children into this world. We <i>adopted</i> two. There, that&#39;s my virtue-signaling bit. One other thing, refuse to allow any person&#39;s actions become the <i>measure</i> of your morals.

"Technological advances have saved humans time and time again, but with all technology it can be used for good and evil, hence we Nobel prizes, dynamite used in industrial mining a good thing, in bombs not so good, cars, vans, lorries replaced the horse, put produce emissions"
"Give me a break.  They say that most facts are made up on the spot, and this guy is an example of that.  Out of the 209 countries listed on the world&#39;s Carbon monitoring site Gr. Britain is the 17th highest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world.  <br><br>It&#39;s not about the U.S. and Gr. Britain making a difference by &quot;sinking into the sea,&quot; simply because the main climate change countries, &quot;the poor&quot; as he puts it, are South and Central America.  He says that &quot;they,&quot; the poor countries, are the ones responsible for climate change, and, as he states, &quot;poor people don&#39;t give a shit about climate change.&quot;  The truth is that the very countries he sites as being the most pollutive are actually among the least pollutive.  The further truth is that the people who are the least responsible for the problem are the ones that suffer from it the most.    <br><br>Beyond that, war is the single highest carbon emitter on the planet... it&#39;s ironical then that most of the wars being fought are started by the U.S. and Gr. Britain and are wars for resources in the very countries that he cites as being &quot;the problem.&quot;  The truth is that in a variety of ways, our highly mechanized, gas guzzling societies, and our war-like posture throughout the world, means that the U.S. and Gr. Britain have, more than any other country&#39;s on earth, been responsible for these countries being poor.  It is our colonialistic foreign policies that have been the determinants of these country&#39;s fate.  The U.S. and Gr. Britain could help these countries combat climate change, not only by example, (by doing our part), but also by lifting our oppressive thumbs off of them.  <br><br>The speech that everyone is talking about?  Hardly.  Nobody I know is talking about it... it&#39;s not worth talking about.  In fact, climate change is just one of many of the failing systems within the realm of what&#39;s called &quot;ecological overshoot&quot; (put that into your search engine)-- where many of the earths systems have reached the point of no return and are collapsing to the point to where they can no longer sustain the population.  Climate change is only a small part of this.  <br><br>This guy&#39;s full of shit, and if you believe anything he has to say you&#39;re as easily led as they come.   <br><br>Worldometer worldwide carbon monitoring meter--  <a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-by-country/#google_vignette"">https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-by-country/#google_vignette</a>"

What an almost impossibly stupid prat. I bet mummy&#39;s so proud of him !
Thanks!
"This is what the right wing bullshit sounds like.  Sorry, but you are NOT the first who said it JUST LIKE THIS..."
shameless dressing downof kids by a grown man
Brilliant! although I don’t agreed all what he said
Deliver the message without the music!   I switched off.
Is the music necessary?
He taks like a Goebbels… does not espouse necessary morals… he seems to take pride in his negatuvity and screw looking for the correct answer… just deliver his privilege.
perspective and delivery.....both outstanding...
"An amazing example of social engineering at its finest. The truth is we have all the tech needed for zero carbon free electric etc… we have all the tech needed for free unlimited clean water for the entire world and for food. All of that is available but we are not given that. Why? Because the elites don’t want to loose control and can’t accept that they, we, are all the same and the only difference between us and them is knowledge of the truth. Just like now they are trying to associate the people who are waking up and starting  to find out what’s going on as WOKE and that all they do is complain and want to be lazy and live in a sick fantasy world. That’s not true. Waking up and seeing through the deception is the truth and what they do not want"
WOKIES aid the enemies and corrupt ruin their own country to yell and scream to waste and distract everyone from the real problems that are being done to the country.
"You has million kid has no food and city is getting bankrupt <br><br>For Eastern large country please go there and see <br>People have enough food. <br><br>has the technology to build new and clean energy and cheap. <br><br>is doing for the climate change more than the west. <br><br>The west is using other countries made items, to cut out the pollution, so if the west is using the poor countries made, you are part of the pollution"

Brilliant speech
I can end this right now without all the fine words...<br><br>Climate Change is a HOAX to put fear in everyone while the few at the top cash in on OUR misery and stupidity...
Why not have this brilliant speech translated into as many languages as possible- and let it be broadcast  far and wide - all across our world!JaiHind!
Wow this guy explains things where we can understand it. Omg who is this guy never seen him or heard about him before
Well that changed a lot.
Turn down the damn background music.
"it sounds lame, to me..."
Spectacular speech!!!!
FANTASTIC  !
"I want to be mad, I want to be angry.....but I am among the poor of America; I live on $900 a month.  I do NOT want to be this poor but life has worked that out for me spectacularly and I am left at nearly 60yo with no retirement, no 401k, no funeral benefits.  I plan on giving my body away for parts and whatever else they can use of it.  I never have believed in cemetaries or funerals.  Use what you can, cremate the rest and make a pendant out of the leftover.<br>Point is that I have always been a social justice warrior and I wanted to hate this man, and his words BUT I CANNOT DENY HIS TRUTHS.   HE SAYS IT ALL SPECTACULARLY!! <br><br>It is unfortunate that in my country being woke has come to mean things that it isn&#39;t; what is even more unfortunate is that most of those against &quot;woke&quot; cannot even define it nor would they recognize it if they did see it because to them being woke means<br><br>LGBTQI friendly or allied,<br>Books about sex written for teenagers and young adults, <br>The beautiful diversity of our country and our planet,<br>And anything that isn&#39;t identified as evangelical Christian friendly.<br><br>You see these people aren&#39;t Christian anymore; in my country, they are Trumpers or as I like to call them MAGATs because they like to destroy lives and ruin people and then revel in what their hate has wrought.<br><br>Our world has a lot of problems but this gentleman says it quite rightly; the poor do not want to be or remain poor and if we want a world at all then instead of trying to leave it like Elon Musk, we need to work on providing clean ways of operating the systems of social movement."
This was not the end of woke but the begining of the end. Thanks konstinine we owe you.
Why the bloody music.???
Reasonable people know the ans
Salute
Wow
One of the most important speeches ever!
"Because there are many poor people in the world does not mean that we should not go on reminding people about the dangers of climate change. It is the fault of capitalism and communism. Trillions and trillions of dollars (or other currencies) are spent every year to kill people!!! Perhaps if we made better use of that money there would be fewer poor people. I notice that the speaker used communist countries to talk about poor people. There are just as many poor in capitalist countries like say Brazil, or India - and many more in Africa, Central America."
Common sense at last
1 in 10 comments are hateful 9 in 10 niceful 😅
Makes to much sense thats just not cricket 😅
"You cut off and edited some parts, let the whole thing play without omission"
Brilliant speech. Well said mate.👏👏👏👏👏👏
Mediocre and arrogant speech with a supremacy that is deteriorating day by day.

Great speech. <br>Nothing changes reality more than the application of the old rule: &quot;Put your money where your mouth is&quot;. <br>.
"It&#39;s about the pursuit of truth and integrity, not the race for speed and spectacle. In our rush to be first at everything, we&#39;ve neglected the importance of truth and are inadvertently fostering a victim mentality in young people. This manipulation is a way to control the future by extinguishing the hope of our next generation and created the so called Woke Culture.

Great presentation.
"Every time you hear the word &#39;woke&#39;, replace it with the word &#39;representation&#39;. That, in essence, is the message.<br><br>Representation inconveniences those with authority and power and the advantageous position many find themselves in. Which is why conservatism is challenged by it (because conservatism is about protecting &#39;the way things are&#39; to those who it suits).<br><br>Dont be considerate; it will worsen your situation. Its a fine argument, but a thoroughly obviously selfish one."
Which British values? Poor people don&#39;t care? We looked at scan photos of wife&#39;s fetus (because he is old shool) and wondered what it would look like at 20months?<br>. Blimey how much does an Oxford education cost? Was it the same grooming and education  given to Frank Kitson when he wrote light insurgency...advocating polluting the waters/communities. Those poor people may need to locate their excrement at your door because of the colonial hole your history dug.
"Poor people in China and South America will not decide how enviornmental policy goes - rather the arrogant self-serving, golden spoon-fed aristocracy - like yourselves - who run the huge companies which are destroying the Earth.

The minute they opened their mouths they went too far.
They are not afraid one of the speakers will knock that glass of water straight on that book?
"Yeah, I disagree hard with that speech. &quot;Wokism&quot; isn&#39;t  plain stupidity, just as &quot;Western civilization&quot; isn&quot;t  common sense. Try to dwell in any of both these items and you just find yourself blinded by your own light. Try to take a step further outside of the common box the next time around."
LOL! I loved these burns. This was such a fucking amazing speech
"something about him saying &#39;we would all send plumes of co2 into the atmosphere for the sake of our own children&#39;, watching everyone clap, and realising that statement roughly translates to &#39;humans care more about themselves than the planet to that extreme AND will clap for it&#39;...<br>...sort of sounds like the climate change problem in a nutshell."
"His argument is so fundamentally flawed amd juvenile. It isn&#39;t &quot;poor people&quot; that are profiting from fossil fuel extraction but the fossil fuel companies that have know about climate change since the 1970s, covered up their findings and bribed politicians to continue with the status quo. Fine if you dont care or want to believe in climate change but millions die and suffer from diseases related to the air and water pollution from fossil fuel extraction and processing but I guess that doesn&#39;t matter because it isn&#39;t sudden and in your face to see everyday. China cares about climate change as it now the market leader in solar panels, EV and other green technologies and installing more green energy capacity than any other country, but facts don&#39;t line up with the beliefs you want to hold."
"Should be required viewing for everyone, well said."
Blind and arrogant - a typical representative of the devil-may-care-generation. Brilliant speech but free of conscience.

"That really is true! woke culture is just a distraction from you being successful and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve realised in my life, everything in this world is a destruction to stop you being successful!<br>work all week, go to the club and waste your money? that was clever!"
yes!
Konstantin keep reminding the people&#39;s that seems fall sleep longer.
"These Soviet juice are something else. Sergey Brin, Max Levchin and now this Konstantin Kisin."
"NONE OF THIS MATTERS!  It is the SUN that is causing global climate change, and an Englishman was the first to discover this cycle. Maunder was his name, the the solar cycle which he found is called the &quot;MAUNDER MINIMUM&quot;, the latter for the period of * minimum * solar activity.<br><br>ITS ALL A FRICKING LIE, fossil fuels driving climate change is NOT TRUE."
"I was really beginning to enjoy Konstantin&#39;s speech until he got to the point where he accused the poor who, in his own words, &quot;couldn&#39;t give a shit about serving the planet.&quot; Somehow, you&#39;re right that only 2 percent is yours in UK, but we all live in one world. I wasn&#39;t born yesterday to not notice how the rich countries work. Of course, your backyard&#39;s clean because you&#39;re rich, but where did you throw your trash?<br><br>Where do you think the dirty coal that India still uses came from? Who owns those tons of crates of garbage that was thrown in Philippines? Which country&#39;s depleting Myanmar&#39;s resources and the natives are losing their land and forest right now? And don&#39;t let me even start with Congo&#39;s resources. You point your finger on the poor where their trash lives beside them but new innovations can only be used and savored by the rich."
I really love people who talk without reading from paper or teleprompter and especially if what they say make sense. It is pathetic that 99% politicians can talk only by reading written speeches.
"I feel so woke today, I can smell the coffee."
there is no woke culture no one would call the worst of an idea a culture it&#39;s just the stupid misunderstanding what the idea was the another stupid group misunderstanding everything as they usually does!
&quot;Woke culture&quot; I think he means the &quot;identitarian culture wars&quot; that right wingers started. lol
"thats the problem here! hes completely right... yet he is just talking?! since when did talking solve any problems on this planet? never!<br>actions weight more than words and what actions have been taken? ofc shouting loudly on a street is not an action.... its the same as writing this comment here!<br>you guys voted... you guys voted for the people, who have produced this outcome and now you have to carry the consequences... <br><br>but hey, somewhere in some room, some dude, speaks to other people who already know what he says! looks like for the mayority this was and still is enough!<br><br>not convinced? look at the UK these days :) also this video here has led to the current situation, since it calms people down, hearing what they think and since its 2024 and imagining things is enough and higher priority than reality, you have the UK right now as it is as the consequence... who could have thought, right? XD"
"The UK outsources most of their production, just like most 1st world countries. I assure you that the UK is responsible for more than 2% of carbon emissions. They&#39;re just funding it on different soil. So yes, there is more that could be done. But they won&#39;t because it&#39;s outsourced for the same reason the rich are not going to foot the bill for people working and creating to create CHEAP renewable energy; money. Cost and profit margins are the deciding factor. That&#39;s why we complain, because those of us working and creating will have the ideas, but most of us will never have the money to actually fund these endeavors. The people who do and who will, will do it for profit. And unless many companies with the funds globally come together and decide they&#39;re going to end world hunger, provide clean water, and provide renewable energy, that&#39;s not going to change."
It’s nice to see real men waking up we will get rid of this problem
"But, Khansstad uber alles is the future. Enjoy the EVIL."
There are Plenty of People here in America that Would &quot;Push The Button&quot; &amp; Still let their Children Starve.
Woke culture holds us back. We need all hands on deck to innovate not to let your emotions take over. I just wished the woke part of our society only saw that.
Should be required viewing for everyone who&#39;s voted left in the last 10 years.
Magnificent material for my debate class 🙏
"The Origins of “Woke”
<br>The term “woke” originated in African American communities in the United States, particularly within AAVE. It was initially used to describe someone who was aware of and knowledgeable about the systemic injustices faced by marginalized communities, especially people of color. Derived from African American Vernacular English, it emerged as a form of resistance against oppression and inequality.? <br>Disgruntled White Conservative Influences has refined WOKE into a white man&#39;s word, They could not find another word for themselves the dumb asses hahaha"
"With all due respect, this idea of &quot;we&#39;re only responsible for x% of climate change&quot; is a disingenuous practice that speaks of laziness rather than logic."
BS. Total trash definition of woke. He thinks Trump would make better leader of free world! No thank you!
"Excellent, sobering speech. <br><br>Too bad that, as Konstantin said in the very introduction, to WOKE degenerates, feelings are more important than facts, than truth."
Smart talented Traitor lic..ing Western ∆$$es
Everyime he speaks is an absolute delight and breath of fresh air. Incredible.
In his natural habitat haha nah good stuff mate!
"The pole of English politics is also greasy and bloody. Over 200 million humans died of English imperialistic colonialism&#39;s terroristic invasions and subjugations of smaller countries, just for the sake of English empire&#39;s global economic status as #1 in rank."
"It&#39;s funny that this guy is worried about Vladimir Putin as an enemy going to capitalize western cultural values. while completely forgetting that Putin is a westerner who&#39;s already using western system. <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJdqJu-6ZPo&amp;t=468"">7:48</a> He is right! You&#39;re not going to get those people to stay poor because some of those people prefer to live with simple life rather than extravagant. Otherwise, he&#39;s just projecting his own personal ideal life, which is being financially rich. But that would consequently make him wrong because he&#39;s completely disregarding those people&#39;s preference for way of living. He&#39;s the one who keeps believing that he has no agency by relying on poor people and communist government in formulating his stance on what to do with climate change because he couldn&#39;t even formulate his own individual perspective. (so much for freedom and liberty of thinking) and complaining about woke people by acting like a victim by blaming the current communist China&#39;s government while completely forgetting the fact that communism, which is Karl Marx&#39; ideology that&#39;s western ideology was adapted by China in order to not look like an enemy that would get attacked by Soviet army and simultaneously against the terroristic English imperialists&#39; threats such as the opium war that was perpetrated by barbaric British traders. The fact that this guy is relying on poor people and communist government in terms of forming his stance and using whataboutism in what to do about the climate change... is basically reveals that he couldn&#39;t even formulate his own individual perspective. So much for freedom and liberty of thinking. He also didn&#39;t really argued against the woke people&#39;s notions therefore, he failed. He tried to give the clean energ and cheap argument but completely forgot to mention that the energy is not solely the thing problem but also material garbage pollution that the western countries dominate in global contribution due to the consequent act of non-western government&#39;s defensive precaution against western terroristic imperialists&#39; threats toward those non-western countries and the transnational western trading factories in those countries for the sake of the maintenance of the supply of valuable resources necessary for the survival of English empire&#39;s global economic status as the #1 in rank."
That man is absolutely right. Have any of these WOKE protesters ever developed or invented anything to save or support the environment. Talking is the easy way and doing is the hard way.
"I used to vote liberal but they&#39;ve been taken over by the radical woke ideology, which is just another form of racism and intolerance disguised as some kind of &quot;social justice.&quot; Thank goodness we have these guys exposing them!"
Kennedy 2024!!!
"Climate change is the number one existential issue of our time. For those among us who feel the need to line their pockets or feed their egos off denying this fact, grow a brain cell. &quot;Clever&quot; fools who find humor in making light of this issue should look at the latest WEF appraisal as to the level of threat, which finally acknowledges what the scientists (even in the oil industry) have been saying for decades..."
I have watched this at least a dozen times over the past year. It gives me hope that we still have a voice in the madness
Canada is woke perfected textbook example. Sheep cowards do not fight back.
Brilliant!!!
"Oh man. - Imagine the woke agenda having to deal with Starmer&#39;s;&#39; Pro Sharia law &#39; mates,  Oh, you guys are sooo screwed."
"Oh no, he told them to work for what they wanted! They don&#39;t like that"
&quot;You&#39;re not going to get these people to stay poor.&quot;<br><br>Come to the US. It seems that people here have degrees in mooching off the welfare system. 😂
"At some point in time in our past, woke people would fill mental institutions. How did this happen?"
"The reason why a lot of poor countries have high amounts carbon emission is beacuse of their population .<br>Countries like India and China habe over a billion people while the UK just has 65 million. <br>The real difference comes in per capita emessions wealther countries and wealthier people do have  higher per capita emissions, not poor people ."
This is like that 13 year old &quot;never talk to the police&quot; video. I like to watch it a few times a year just for fun.
"All woke and dei people can freely go and live in Africa, there they will be able to pay off their “debt”, since they suffer so much from it."
"Por fin un hombre joven con sentido común, y la inteligente para expresar mis ideas. La agenda o ideología WOKE es basura para la vida en este planeta."
&quot;It will be decided by poor people who DO NOT CARE about saving the planet&quot;<br>&quot;question&quot;<br>&quot;No thank you.&quot;<br>Epic. Don&#39;t take stupid questions when you have a point to make still.
Brilliant 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
"Thank you Mr. Kisin. Well said, Sir ! Not just Putin but WEF, The CCP.  and globalists."
Absolutely spot on!
"It is not a question of being poor, the issue is people who need money to reside paying rent. The system has reverted to possible earnings being standardized to not being enough. Then, you need to ask about China, why they are all so sane, smart, economically fine, not homeless, have culture, pay 2 dollars for clothing, and 10 dollars for phones, 40 dollars for computers, and 1000 dollars for a car."
"woke has become objective reality and now means that you buy the cheapest option versus the brand name, because technology (and AI) has facilitated the quality gap to be bridged. For example lab diamond versus real diamonds, stamped clothing versus the &quot;official&quot; clothing, rebadging items, sticker says Apple 9.0, but is a smart underneath, fly econo versus first class, take a ride-share versus buy a car, etc. on the logic that you are dumb and NOT smart if you pay 20X the price for anything that is a good enough representation of the same product because from the &quot;factory&quot; it cost 4 usd to make regardless of the brand.
<br>Woke is accelerated by technology doing increasing workloads of human jobs, this means no monthly salaries anymore, but freelance fee paid to you for the job, which AI did 80% of anyway, so 5 usd per hour is generous.
<br>Further this affects relationships among humans, where marriage was until death, increasingly it is about the 1 night stand relationship, then move on to the next, and pets (dogs and cats) have gained marriage status, being valued equal to or greater than humans to live under the same roof with.
<br>Social impact is seen, where the male is still expected to earn and pay bills, despite the same being excluded from the corporate hiring practices, relegating a man to hard labor jobs only, and a &quot;threat&quot; in the &quot;office&quot;."
Psychologue et psychiatre sont l&#39;avenir 😂😂😂😂😂 et bon courage aux jeunes qui ne paieront pas les retraites de leurs parents. Et oui et vos parents vous ont portes😅😅. Affaires de votre famille
Woke voices??? 😂😂😂😂😂😂  sleeping noise that repesent a minority.... because they are so sound ASLEEP🤯🤯🤯
"Im really appreciate the rational speaking of Konstantin, but the point is to give as much more rational  thinking,  BECAUSE  we as people need something consistent. I&#39;m coming from Earth, and believe me, it tried to kill us 100x1000 times, and you are still here is safe if you find some control. Ask some astrophysics how much impact will have some Supernova blows would like millions of years ago if we in the way. We live on this planet by coincidence and luck and you should appreciate every second we are here."
I always come back to this just to show people how woke culture really has devolved hard.
💯
A brilliant speech with a lot of good Humor 👍
Wow that man is quite a grifter 😅. Im surprised he didnt svck himself off right then and there.
"A filthy traitor is spewing lies about the country his parents were also proud to betray. But hey, when you allow traitors into your so-called establishment it tells everything about you to anyone who wants to know the truth about British."
"One point, I&#39;d argue that Climate Change would be fairly high on XJP priority list. China is a 4000 year old civilization, and XJP doesn&#39;t have to worry about ruling terms and reelection, it&#39;s stewardship of an established civilization, not the building of a new one. There is a fundamental difference in mentality there, which is important to highlight as the speaker illustrates a relatable scenario, using relatable imagery for XJP&#39;s life. <br><br>Sustainability in that context would be an underlying principle, and if one takes a look at China&#39;s adoption of sustainable measures, the reality reinforces this statement."
Like it!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJdqJu-6ZPo&amp;t=454"">7:34</a> precisely my stance on caring for the environment. People come first. Life first. Figure out climate issues in the context living an actual life that doesn&#39;t involve iron age regression"
"Woke culture should not be called like that, It gives false meaning to a term awaken. Same as homophobia, no one is affraid of gays, people mostly hate them, but they don&#39;t fear them. So basically everything about &quot;woke&quot; culture is false starting from the terminology to ithe deology. Should be called &quot;misguided&quot; culture, and  the root to this problem is deep mistrust towards autority. And this distrust snd its roots are s theme  for itself."
"Sir, please help us in America! We are unbelievably tolerant with this madness. Help!! TRUMP 🇺🇸🇺🇸💪🇺🇸🏴‍☠️"
wild west needs you to be the governor
"Not all people from other racial-grouos/cultures are interested in this stupid, nihilistic woke-garbage.<br>Russia, China, South African Nations, South American nations and others, are pushing agaist Western-liberalism.<br><br>Seriously, white-liberals think they know better than everyone else. They are completely delusional and self-righteous.🌏🤡"
Great speech.
"Very good but, he believes climate change is real?!"
"Britain, Australia, Canada, the United States have a duty to retain their identities. And the current demand that they must change, is an extension of the new demand, mandate of compliance, acquiescence, obedience, and submission placed upon us. While recognising and respecting other cultures is important, it is no more critical, and vital than our collective respect, regard, and appreciation of our own identities, our own institutional pillars, and institutions, the values and traditions that have long defined our countries, and societies, and not allow them to be deconstructed, broken down, and dismantled.
<br>
<br>It is not about intolerance, and inequality (favouritism) it is about ensuring our core values remain strong, durable and influential. By doing so we can maintain the integrity of our institutions and the cohesive fabric of our society."
Absolute bs. Says things that can easily be challenged by using actual sources and proof.
"Amazing speech. Put aside the wit and jokes, he was genuine in his promise to try and speak to the &quot;woke&quot; crowd from a position of understanding their feelings, a position of empathy, and a position of shared values of wanting the best for the world albeit from a differing angle."

woke agenda is a power play by people on the cluster b spectrum - has nothing to do with equality
I tried to leave a comment on his last post yet the people who run u tube wouldn&#39;t let my comment saying 404 server not found so I made a comment saying can&#39;t comment yet that got posted hmmmmmm free speech really we should have free speech when we agree with like this man but not the rubbish going around

"Never heard this word before 5 years ago, never heard anyone say - Sure, Bob can come along, he&#39;s always been woke! It&#39;s a bullshit word! No one used that word until some rightwing internet troll created it and dispersed it. Some young liberals took to it but it really resonates with rightwingers bc it&#39;s a way for them to talk about &quot;gays and blacks&quot; without sounding overtly homophobic or racist. It&#39;s a bullshit word."
super
"Laughter and truth matter. At least Kisin got the laughter right. Homo sapiens are defined by stories, not truth. One story has taken us further than any other. That story has changed our world to the point where &quot;we are in the fight of our lives&quot;. That story is the money story. The problem is not that we have too many left wing nutters or too many right wing nutters or too many &quot;woke&quot; people or too many religious fanatics. The problem is the money story. We need to reconstruct our money story to ensure the survival of Homo sapiens by constructing a story based on Earth&#39;s true currency - air, water, soil, biodiversity and energy. This is a monumental task. It may be that only AI can take us there. We have to recognise that we are an inseparable part of the Earth&#39;s ecosystem. This is the truth that matters more than any other. If Kisin truly cares for his son, he must face this truth now. To all of us, if we truly care for our children and their children and their children and their children, we must face this truth now."

Scott Jennings: Biden Refuted The Entire Thesis Of His Campaign On Friday
So true. Life is not fair get used to it get a hair cut get an education and get a job. Everything comes down to personal responsibility because one day you&#39;re going be standing face to face with God and held responsible whether you like it or not. And that&#39;s why socialists hate God because they don&#39;t want to be held individually responsible.

"One of my clients had been 90% blind from a child and he once said to me that if I ever meet anyone that is more positive than me, I know I have more work to do. Another client was a Thalidomide, and she never complained either. She loved to laugh, joke and have fun, she had so much personality."
What a low-life move.  How do these people tolerate one another?   How do people tolerate themself when they know the impact something so tasteless would have?  Sick.
I’ve got a brother like the handicapped man Mr. Kisin met.  He’s a functional quad who can only push with one leg and has spastic control of one arm.  He also has severe short term memory loss.  He can’t eat by mouth and is fed by a tube.  He has a great attitude and is happy.  It is amazing!

Do we really have to lay this all out? Victim hood? Virtue signalling? Are people that lost that they don’t see this blatant over play of emotional thinking?
"So, let me tell you something, I’m blind, I work and study at the same time, and am on the way to finishing my second university degree, which will take time, but will come at one point in the next 18 months. I speak three languages fluently. I’m a certified teacher of English and give lessons in German as well. I’ve never felt I’m a victim. The only thing I feel is disappointment. I’m disappointed that people less qualified than me get 100 times more attention than I. I’m disappointed because the societal models being promoted today are based on victimhood and not on performance or merit. I have migration background, I have a disability, and none of the above has been ever used to take advantage of circumstances. Never in a job interview, for example, have I mentioned that I have these two things. All of the people I’ve talked to have shown the greatest respect for what I am and what I do, and that is a sign that I should not stop, and I won’t. That is for sure."
"I think a lot of the irony in this statement is religious people usually follow the same mindset.  This is my life because this is what god chose for me so I&#39;m just going to ride it out.  I don&#39;t disagree, It&#39;s just social media isn&#39;t the first thing to make people think this way."
"Many students want to destroy capitalism though it is the opportunity of CHOICE. Socialism is by one&#39;s needs. There is no one forcing people to purchase those things they do not need in capitalism. True capitalists understand they must say NO to the commercials, hawkers and sellers."

"Agency = Personhood.  If you reject accountability and responsibility for your own actions and fate, then you are rejecting your freedom and status as a human being, reducing yourself to a mere resource; a slave at best, compostable biomass at worst.  That narcisistic victimhood mentality not only degrades yourself, but the entire human species."
"The Bulgarian social scientist who specialises in democracy, Ivan krastav, says democracy fails if people don’t believe in their country, in shared values. How could Britain have sunk so low? I hope there is still life in the sinking mother ship."
"Leftards<br>&quot;Climate change is bad!&quot;<br>Society<br>&quot;So do something about it.&quot;<br>Leftards<br>&quot;Hey, I like to virtue signal, I don&#39;t want to be virtuous!&quot;"
"Konstantin exactly specializes on good sounding, but misleading ideas. It is true that people play victims to get attention, but it is also true that people, and kids especially, are oppressed. They feel it, but they can&#39;t explain this properly and incorrectly rationalize this as racism and patriarchy. Just as conservatives incorrectly explain economic depression by immigration. The very fact that people have to pretend they are victims to be at least somewhat successful is exactly showing how broken out society is. There are no other ways for these kids to succeed in our world. Somebody has stolen their future along with their prospects of getting on housing ladder. Did you stole it, Konstantin, with your sweet speeches? Now you come by and essentially say &quot;you&#39;re bad people for playing victims, look at that disabled dude, you should be ashamed&quot;. I don&#39;t think you even understand how devastating and evil your message is. Fix the problem, not the &quot;bad&quot; kids who respond to the problem."
… people are taking responsibility for their own lives… by convincing others they are victims of crime. This guy retarded.
"Thats the big difference, real &quot;victims&quot; dont wanna be seen as a victim. People who wanna be seen as a victim are faking it for their own narcism"

I&#39;m no fan either (I just loathe the concept of thought policing) but they&#39;re just as if not more screechy than the woke liberals. They&#39;re literally flip sides of the same coin. Hell, both these guys have basically made a career of playing to it. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so uncomfortable for KK to talk about Ukraine, because if he&#39;s honest he&#39;s going to piss off all his subscribers. At least here in the US."
"When you cater to and caudal stupid, you will always get more of it."
"the last thing that anyone with a disability wants is for anyone to think of them as a victim, shit happened thats life they got on and dealt with it, the vast majority of these so called &quot;victims&quot; these days are just cries for attention and hustles for free handouts"
"Everyone is a victim today. I am a victim, give me money and free stuff."
So well said.
Well that just shits on everybody who has been abused and wronged in some way. Guess these people are abuser enablers?
"KK puts across Israel as victims, and they had no other real option but to kill thousands of women and children.  He is disingenuous and has an agenda, which is that the oppressed and those that are being wronged should put up and shut up, and he extends this to the UK and West.  In the west too, we have corrupt politicians who serve Zionist interests and that of their clique&#39;s above the massess.  Income inequality is at its greatest as is absolute poverty.  Otherwise, we are all in agreement that blaming the other for every single failing as individuals or as society and not taking responsibility makes matters worse."
Victims getting attention tell that to the victims of grooming gangs
We are breeeding psychopathic children ... That they are the most important thing on the planet .....
"The most determination I&#39;ve ever seen in a person comes from people with cerebral palsy. Imagine having a perfectly working brain, but your body just doesn&#39;t want to listen to it and do its own thing."
"Your statement that religion has been a bad thing in human history (your other speech), is fundamentally wrong. In the whole, religion has been a net benefit, as it has engendered morals an ethics in the human diaspora."
"The problem with rewarding, and then debasing, &quot;victimhood&quot;, is that it takes away from actual victims, those who have been systematically repressed due to their disadvantages, whether that&#39;s a disability, their skin colour, their social background, or simply down to the fact they don&#39;t have a voice in the constant clamour that is the woke far left vs the non-existent far right rhetoric.  Thus we end up with an over-privileged, brainwashed majority who think that their imagined struggles and first world problems deserve more attention and remedy than those who are victims of the generational oppression caused by the ancestral power of these privileged classes."
Dark skinned?  Maybe in Sweden.
Most real victims hate to be seen or percived like victims.
Being an oppressed victim is &quot; fun &quot; ?
Konstantin Kisin hombre.
"When you are a victim, nothing can change. It is only when you become an active participant that you can choose your path."
Wow…..what this really screwed up world desperately needs is more people like this amazing fellow Konstantin.
Was raised well by smart parents and went to exceptional schools. Took advantage of that and would like to think I spread it around. Not for me to say...
And right wingers do the same saying the leftists are ruining your world so fight them rather than finding solutions and working with each other.
"There is some truth to the social benefit of the victimhood narrative. But Jordan Peterson has earned fame and fortune telling young people to clean their bedroom and take responsibility for your life. Fortunately, most humans admire heroes (however flawed) not victims."
Jordan Peterson<br><br>Looks different 😂
"I first observed this ~ 15 years when pseudoscience conmen began to garner massive followings on social media. They offered simple, grandiose wrong answers to scientific problems that led their lazy audience to believe that everything they hadn&#39;t be bothered to learn at school was wrong anyway and they were now ahead of actual scientists because they were &#39;open-minded&#39; enough to listen to these charlatans. 15 years later that same formula used by the pseudoscience conmen is now being applied to virtually everything online."
Watch “Sound of Freedom” and see real oppression and real ‘mental health issues.’
"KK is right in principle , but there is a danger of domination of Right wing think which I do not believe is good, A big straw man with the ultra privalged Oxford students, but there are still desperate caualties in our world..  ,People in a deap hole not of thier own making , eg a child from a drug or alcohol dominated familly..  Yes some characters can beat that, at least superfiscially, but we are all of different clay and for many it is not possible ,,We must seek the middle line or ground on this , Victimhood culture widespread is certainly bad, but no victim damaged persons is also a bad way ..  WE should not allow the &quot;winners and losers &quot; to get too far apart ,, That in the long run not good for the &quot; winners&quot; or the &quot; losers &quot; .."
Lgbt ideology etc is more harmful than communism to the human being than the ussr was
Just a beautiful yet tragic sentiment of our contemporary society 😢
It&#39;s easier to fail because your the victim than trying your best and fail.Its always because of your colour or race or gender or ethnicity not because you didn&#39;t make the grade.This turns into a culture that people subconsciously or deliberately make it happen..<br>Kids from low income families and deprived areas are often brought up in homes with unemployed parents living on social handouts.These areas usually have high crime rates and having a criminal record is almost a badge of honour.. the kids are told they will never get a decent job because of where they live and attend a notorious school... with that in mind they don&#39;t care about school and have more emotional connection with the gang they run with than family..... to get the clothes and shoes ( far above the amount parents can afford) they turn to crime which gains them a police record and reduces the chance of a good job...... it&#39;s a never ending cycle that begins with being told thay have no chance of getting on because &quot;THEY WON&#39;T LET YOU&quot; ..... victims of the culture of victimisation.....
All truth can cause discomfort to the lazy thinker.
Ian Dury was very disabled and never ever complained about his situation.  He even had to be carried onto the stage sometimes because if his condition.
Konstantins suit ... 👌
"It&#39;s called positive feedback loop - get a little attention, social media amplifies the attention and now other people will subscribe to the behavior or beliefs that garner attention. Which leads to a wave of people acting in concert with stupidity."
"social validation feedback loop <br><br>As a recovering addict, out of all the drugs I&#39;ve used, or seen the effects of,<br>- the Like button is by far the worst, hands down...<br><br>No other drug has been as detrimental to society as the Social validation feedback Loop has.<br><br>- love to ALL, feel no hate"
I think one of the best speeches I&#39;ve heard!  Thankyou Konstantin.
Did this man just say “I’m dark skinned”??!!😂😂😂 Dudes as white as space ghost.
George So ros is behind most of these dysfunctional social trends.
Oooooooo9oo9ooooooooooo
When truth becomes controversial stupidity is seizing the day.
Thanks Konstantin you are an example to us all especially considering how tough you had it in your impoverished childhood and all😅
"the more attention, the more 💵💵"
I love Konstantin Kisin. He is very bright …..he really seems able to easily see the faults/weaknesses in peoples arguments.  That’s why I don’t get into those debates with people. I can’t come up with a good counter argument until an hour later 😒.  It’s frustrating. Plus I’ve internalized white guilt for years….so I just shut myself up.
"Then why are you Kostya darling allowing your beloved Ukrainian Loyalists ( I&#39;m not gonna say &quot; Nazis &quot; because MI- 6 knows I&#39;ve got Loyalist friends of my own and I love them dearly ) all the victimhood they could ever desire? Why are you peddling the &quot; Ukraine is good, Russia is pure evil &quot; garbage that insults your considerable intelligence and makes you look like a shill- not a brilliant scholar. Why are you doing this?"
I absolutely hate this but I&#39;m with Kostya 120%.
"Sometimes it feels like pulling teeth, but is sanity and common sense finally working its way back into the western world today? We need more and more people like this to come out of the shadows, grab us by the back of the neck and ram our heads into a brick wall to wake us up."

"I&#39;ve ways found the most disadvantaged people, physically and mentally disabled people, often look at themselves with the least victimhood and have the most drive. <br>Why? Because they have to be to survive. <br>The problem is woke lefties that keep on telling them they are useless and can&#39;t achieve anything by themselves."
Feeling good not the same as Being good.
True hardship builds character.
"We have done young people a great disservice over the past 50 years because we have allowed this victim mentality, and this fantasy world to develop to the point where so many people think that it’s actually real.  We now have young men walking around, thinking that they’re women. We have young actresses going around getting their breasts removed (Ellen Page) so they can look like men. We have millions of black kids who think that slavery happened because of racism. They don’t even know that in the early days of world slavery, people didn’t bring in slaves from other continents. The slaves and the slaveowners were virtually identical people. The first slaves in America were Irish. The ignorance goes on and on, and the reason it goes on and on is because the ignorance is serving a narrative."

"ahahah i said exactly that, A dude or lady, (i forgot) on Subtle Asian Traits was having the second gen immigrant/early adult identity Crisis and my message to that person is essentially that: No one but yourself are the one roadblocking you into how or what you need/want to be. <br><br>Random people replying to my message like: damn you lack empathy, blabla bla. <br><br>So yeah, can relate. this happened literally this week"
"Trigfeenometry stand for free speech, unless you dare ask questions about the holocaust or even interview someone who has questions... Then you must not speak!"

"Chinese collectivism allows for much individualism, same way conservatives are far more tolerant of differences n don&#39;t force on their opinions. The concept embodies ultimately the idea of the cosmological self, cultivated thro society.

KONSTANTIN BEST INTERVIEWS!!!!<br>🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️
What a great conversation. Thank You.
"Konstantin is so clear and has so much clarity in his words, he says so much using simple and few words while staying focused on the point. The host on the other hand says so little using complex words in a over drawn out babble of words that rambles on and on to the point of losing focus."
"It beats being taken over by the WEIRD RIGHT CRAZIIES who want to control how you have sex in whom you have sex with, control over women&#39;s bodies, legalize racism, and when it comes to shutting down free speech, they make the wokey left look like amateurs."
The smarter a person gets the more evil he becomes
"Just to be clear about the idea that says that is good is that which works, there&#39;s no moral content to that which works. Pragmatism is a distinctly American philosophy that has some merit; however, if that which works is evil, then that which works cannot be the good. Pragmatism (ism is a suffix for a life and worldview). If an ism is attached an idea, that idea is a philosophical assertion for truth. If something works now will it work at all times? No, it does not. That which works is often temporal and creates other problems exponentially. Pragmatism is abscessed with solving problems but never considers the long term consequence. Does that sound familiar in our government that keeps kicking the can down the road to later solve it when it creates a more serious problem. <br><br>Sorry people but life is going to be difficult and no amount of that which works is going to ultimately solve those problems. That means we are continually responding to problems created a previous problems that created several more problems.<br><br>Now for this super structure idea, that is way over simplified. To have some value are sacred then that value must be eternally true. If a value is only of human preference, it will not ever be an ultimate value. All values must be measured by an ultimate source that has the power to enforce those values ultimately. If there is no consequence ultimately, then all values are temporal and I may pursue my own personal interest and use any means to attain it. If the wicked prosper then wickedness works, right? Then again if there is no ultimate value then good and evil do not exist. That which works has many avenues for that which is good. The good is that which humans say is good."
All of these woke ideas inclusion victimhood feeling good at all costs without actually being good. They all stem from the women being raised to positions of power they will give up the fight for what is right for what is feels good every time. To women the only thing that matters is don&#39;t be mean which means don&#39;t tell the truth don&#39;t look at problems don&#39;t point out anything that&#39;s abnormal. We&#39;re all in this together we&#39;re all love we need to cherish each other&#39;s experience. And none of this absolutely none of it as a position in the hierarchies of our society. These ideas are meant to be at home in our families and carried out into the world and used in the decision processes for doing battle in business or life these are the underlying values that make us human they are not values that you can lead a society success. Running a society with these values will lead to failure and destruction and dominance by others.
"The problem with pseudointellectuals like this guy is that they&#39;re actually much more concern about sounding smart with their righteous-English language but  they ends-up failing because they&#39;re simultaneously ignoring their target enemy&#39;s different perspective and motivation that generates the narrative.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXEnSX_aRRE&amp;t=875"">14:35</a> The problem with that individualist&#39;s &quot;you matter&quot; is the fact that the Christianity&#39;s scapegoatism is still being use by those individualistic people by treating the other &quot;perceived-incompetent&quot; as the &quot;obvious&quot; sacrifice through torturing the target with social condemnation.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXEnSX_aRRE&amp;t=128"">2:08</a> The only reason why you feel that &quot;this kind of thing is going to arise at certain times in history&quot; is because of the immature western culture, which is the byproduct of the failure of western civilization to developed sophisticated collective therapeutic spiritual disciplines in the long-term... because of the destructive geopolitical influence of the Dark Ages."
Woke people are not using weaponized empathy because they don&#39;t care about empathy because they&#39;re actually being pretentious concern toward the other people people that they perceived to &quot;deserve better&quot;. It&#39;s narcissistic compassion that is driving their motivation.

question for konstantin: did the suicides of prison guards take place immediately after the death of stalin or after the khrushchev &quot;secret speech&quot; 3 years later? i&#39;ve read solzhenitsyn and he seems unclear on the point.
"Zionism is more dangerous than Nazism because: You cannot distinguish who is a Jew and who is a Zionist. Who is playing offer who is Zionist.<br>They exploit the Holocaust card and the antisemitism card. Christian Zionists claim they are helping Jews. Christian Zionism is an extreme ideology that supports Israel, seeing it as fulfilling biblical prophecy for Jesus&#39;s Second Coming, Armageddon, and the judgment of non-Christians. Jewish Zionists say they are a minority, and the majority of Zionists are Christian. Very few people have the time to understand what Zionism truly is. The power of Zionism lies in its ability to corrupt representatives in Western countries with money, making them support the colonialist state and even banning TikTok from criticizing Israel. Zionists have big control over media, from newspapers to radio, TV, YouTube, and Facebook. Israeli Zionists kill and attack any place in the West and then retreat to Israel. Zionists can ruin your career almost anywhere in the West by labeling you as antisemitic."
Really good episode. Thank you
We are seeing the cons of democracy. It great but once fools take charge counties and empires fall
Thank you
"What is not working is bringing on poverty to all America--we do not have it so good  and it is getting worse, not better.  Poverty is reality and all your woke talk doesn&#39;t  make anything better."
I doubt either of you know what poverty is!

The panels with tape are the distracting  flaw of an otherwise well designed set
It&#39;s all about threats to the economy.
Sounds like Tom is putting on guests to confirm Tom&#39;s belief.  This is so below the contents he was producing 5 years ago.  What bunk!
Like watching two blind guys play darts What is this &quot;spark of divinity&quot; ?  And the idea behind the constitution is not unnatural in the slightest . Think of   A father and his children and you will understand
Bilyou claiming he knew lots of people who were poor is ridiculous - &quot; I was a big brother to a kid that lived IN Compton&quot; =   LOL  First of all Compton is not poor and I&#39;m not sure it ever was - I moved there as a teen for a brief period and what amazed me when I got there is how much money they had (nasty people and poverty of the soul - yeah that&#39;s a different story)  secondly he is not old enough to have seen it at its worst.  It was way better by the time he was old enough to be a Big Brother.<br>Pretty much everybody from major urban areas has never seen real economic poverty or poor people
"I am a Dutch national living in The Gambia, West Africa.... am so happy that this woke shit is near non existing here. Wokeness is a truly Western phenomenon... for now."

"I was looking for this video earlier, and found the flipside version of it with Tom on Triggernometry. That one was fantastic. I was going back to listen to it again and this one popped up."
"There needs to be equality of opportunity. However, the issue is that the idea of a meritocracy is being abandoned in favour of social engineering. A DEI actor doesn&#39;t necessarily have talent or charisma. An all female cast is not a recipe for on-screen magic. An all-black games studio is not guaranteed to produce good games. Individual aspects like talent, imagination and charisma are crucial as well as the personal will to hone skills and gain experience over many years. This is all being cast aside in the name of forced equality. This tide must be turned before it ruins us. The western entertainment industry is probably beyond saving now but the rot is spreading. Do you want a heart surgeon that knows what they are doing or are you happy with a diversity hire? There is already talk of hiring airline pilots on the basis of diversity quotas......"
No other state played the victim role like the Jewish. People got killed by the millions during the human history.

Nahh not the world just he western capitals
"It&#39;s no mystery that some can be sacrificed - there are never a shortage of conspicuous antisocial people. But Stalin&#39;s problem was an inability to reflect on the difference between his first victims, and the kulaks, his later manufactured victims."
WOKE is just a diversion the cult is using. They need us fighting amongst each other while they destroy mankind.
"Sorry, Konstantin is riding on the back of wok bashing to spread a dangerous fascist narrative. He is being promoted by the elite."
"So, we have many university students promoting communism, yet when the numbers don&#39;t stack up and show it does not work out at the end of the day.<br>Are these students being influenced by some professors?<br>Does that mean some of these professors don&#39;t ask them selves the 5 why&#39;s?<br>A lack of depth of thought?<br><br>Edit: typos"
"I really find it so easy to sit for 3 hours and listen to a good conversation.<br>We (today&#39;s people) find it so hard to have meaningful, reasonable, sometimes challenging conversation.<br>Konstantin brought me here, but I really enjoy hearing you for the first time Tom.<br>Thank you both for being brave! (Sorry Konstantin but you are! haha)"

"I know this will be an unpopular comment and will get me mocked but...<br><br>When talking about covid and its said that it wasn&#39;t that spreadable, it wasn&#39;t a big deal, it was about authoritarian behaviour etc, this is a poor take in my opinion.<br><br>My wife and I observed the rules. We stayed in. We didn&#39;t mingle. We got through about 1.5 years covid free. We then went out to london one night. Our first night actually going somewhere congested with no mask or anything. We travelled by train on the saturday and travelled home on sunday. On Monday we both had covid. Not one of us, it was both of us. That is a spreadable disease/illness/sickness or whatever. We don&#39;t know how we got it. Was it from a person? The hotel we stayed in? Something we touched? Impossible to know. Now of course you may argue the effect of covid. For a few days we felt terrible. Could&#39;t sleep, eat etc. But we got over it, we didn&#39;t die. However, when it first happened in the world people were, supposedly, dying. So you take the fact that yeah, something spreads via all sorts of unknown means and it can potentially kill you. What do you do?<br><br>If you own a shop and there is an issue with a gas leak, you know its going to have a terrible effect on people exposed. You might die, you might not. But you know its there and you need to make sure your people are safe. Do you send them home to keep them safe and away from danger until the issue is resolved or do you make them go home and be safe while you fix it? the former is the obvious choice even if you are responsible for only 2-3 people. Government is responsible for protecting millions and billions.<br><br>At the time I feel the governments, who we like to say are responsible for our safety (thats not deniable, we expect government to serve us and ensure we get what we need to survive and uphold how we expect our country to be maintained) made the sensible choice. It was a difficult time where none of us would know what to do. Its fine to look back and say &quot;i would have done this&quot; but would you? When you are in it, its a different matter and most of us do not know the feeling or pressure of being responsible for billions of people."
So many times KK starts interviewing Tom 😆 great video!
I LOVED this conversation!
"Funny how Tom thinks he has seen poverty up close.. and proceeds to describes a home, refrigerator and air conditioning but bad neighborhood 😆 cracks me up. This is definitely the description of poverty in the USA. For most parts of the world this description is an upper middle class. I was born and raised by a single mom in a room that was our bedroom, kitchen, living room &amp; bathroom with no refrigerator or AC. Anyways... whatever your definition of poverty is, the truth is WE CAN ALL GET OUT OF IT, BETTER OURSELVES &amp; CONTRIBUTE TO THE WORLD . ✌️♥️<br>Thank you TOM for sharing this with us."
It all boils down to wealth inequality and corruption. People just don&#39;t know what to point their fingers at.
"The best analogy I have seen: many progressives have Munchausen’s syndrome, or Munchausen’s by proxy. America is like the child who was being poisoned by her mother in the movie Sixth Sense. The mother gets addicted to the attention and sympathy she gets for seeming to be a “caring” figure. So addicted that she ignores the fact that she is hurting the child, killing her ultimately. The poison is wokeism and DEI. It has not proven to be effective; if anything it’s been proven to be the opposite, destructive even. The mother is all the progressives, academics, and people who are addicted to the attention, sympathy, and other benefits (academic, professional, social, and otherwise) that they get for either claiming to be oppressed, or advocating for others who fit that description. They have total disregard for the consequences; in fact they have, through cancel culture, shut down any discussion, much less debate. People respond to incentives; it’s almost understandable in that context. But given the hysteria, and the destructiveness to our society, it’s time to push back."
I&#39;m a Christian and a recently graduated chaplain from college. This forum needs to be heard in the faith based community
"&#39;men need sex to feel loved and women need love to have sex&#39;<br>I imagine men don&#39;t feel loved since becoming the boon of western society jokes, hence porn addictions?"
All men are created equal does not equate to every human having divinity. That is a twisting of the Christian teaching that all men are created in the image of God which does not equal divinity.<br> That is an old Christian heresy from the time of the early Christian church. It is because the US stopped being protestant but kept parts of the teaching which allowed it to come back as neo-gnosticism.
"I just realized how different the rest of the west is from the USA in relation to the <a href=""http://left.in/"">left.In</a> most other western countries the real left is low income workers with a few highly educated members and some college students.The bulk of it is mostly working class that struggles everyday.And the workers certainly ain&#39;t <a href=""http://woke.so/"">woke.So</a> their main reason for being left is entirely different than the USA.Anyways, watched hundreds of hours of JP,Murray,Haris etc etc,and ll of em have character flaws.But Kisin....I cant find any faults to his character,he has become my favorite very fast."
"IF TOM SOWELL IS SO LEGIT THEN GET HIM ON YOUR SHOW. HE&#39;s 93!!! Cummon guys, stop ducking him. How many times has Kneel Tyson been on Rogan? TOM SOWELL HASN&#39;T BEEN ON ROGAN ONCE!!! Get Tom Sowell on your show!"
Look how many lawsuits the left have against Donald Trump an ex President who is running against the current administration for election. This is unprecedented election interference and persecution of a political opponent.
and that is why i reject most christians. they wont or cant be soldiers or warriors ..unlike the evil islamics ..i suggested merging the two cults but it didnt get any traction.
and if you know its my coffin and Gay the Devil put a hell programme into the sphere that runs it you know why evil [God] is so much stronger than any number of good men...what then? you are right being moral is good. but under HIM it makes you food.  the only possible recourse is battle.
yes the pendulum is wildly unbalanced.  Gay always chose Tragedy but i chose Comedy. now he is beaten but the CIA is determined to make me crash. so i think we will wind up with a really off the wall surreal kafka or dostoevski.
Sensitivity is the millennials drug
"Kisin has hit the nail on the head about what differentiates the west from all other cultures - individualism / individual liberty / individual freedom. It has taken the west quite far. But I think this idea is running on fumes now.<br><br>The better system is to have individual rights AND duties. Rights without duties will lead to anarchy. <br><br>And the reason why such anarchy is only rearing its head in the west now is because, for the past 100 years, people inherently understood the importance of taking responsibilities, even though no one was shoving on them. But now, people have forgotten the importance of taking responsibilities along with the rights given to them by their society."
Incredible guest! He and Jordan Peterson have been thee best so far!
It is weaponized!
"Tom, if life is simply an accident of chemical reactions then by definition there is nothing &quot;sacred&quot; about life. You can&#39;t have it both ways."
Konstantin talks about Russians fighting wars for the monarchy. Who the hell does he think the American military is fighting war after war after war for? These are clearly imperialist wars fought by the poor for the rich. Konstantin might be an expert on Russia but he&#39;s got a lot to learn about the west.
Social media needs to go
"The way to deal with woke people is to refuse to converse with them on their terms, just tell them you will only talk on your terms, then you control the situation and no one needs to be offended by anything said, if the other person refuses this, just politely excuse yourself from their company."
The error is in assuming theyre bright minds because they go to Oxford lol. they are the most brainwashed that i would agree
It all starts at school you brainwash them when they are young and naive because they will believe anything you tell them it’s called indoctrination wake up
I love Konstantin.
"That woman who keeps shouting at the panel should have been removed has no manners at all, she is route."
Year later its got alot worse
The youngs are worth an effort
"Communism was exported to Russia by ex leaseholders,now the West is trying again."
"what I loathe the most is that the woke call people racist or nazis very quickly, which is a very harsh insult. but somehow that&#39;s ok."
I bet he gives a toss about poor people in Asian countries. This guy must have connections with the oil industry.
If he can be called a &quot;satirical comedian&quot; wtf is that bloated gasbag across from him?

"I am a big fan of this guy but the &quot;only 2% Co²&quot; argument is bogus , Why ? Because if advanced nations show you can prosper without burning much carbon fuel, and can also prove it is a superior econömy in cost , which many believe to be the case, then that is the goal.. ,As a successful example.. Too many can only immagine the change to renewables as be a loss situation and that is not reasonable, that is not the case, .. Not te mention national security of energy independence ."
"Young people, ask yourself why leaders would listen to a young girl, Greta that hasn&#39;t live long enough to know what size bra she needs to buy??

"An old army mate of mine who did two tours of Malaya and two of Vietnam (including with the AATTV) experienced a severe PTSD episode at a cinema during the ambush scene in Forrest Gump, which required him receiving assistance to leave the cinema. Then you get complete farquewits like these two, who&#39;ve led soft-arsed privileged existences, preaching to everybody else about what they shouldn&#39;t be triggered by. Go farque yourselves with a shared carrot, you small-minded wankers."
Uh...capacity
"Konstantin is sooooo right, on every aspect he considers. Thruthfull honest thinking capaity. Brilliant analyzer. No ego-lead person. Just in search of the truth and coming up with real solutions. Independent thinker."

Next thing you know NASA comes out and says there&#39;s evidence that beings lived on Venus but they created their own global warming and therefore that&#39;s why Venus is as deadly and inhospitable today lol.
"You do not have to defeat the woke people  just ignore them, Stupidity always disappears over time so no problem."
"Its not the woke mentality alone, it is the right&#39;s inhibiting the very progress he apparently champions. Perhaps he&#39;s too young to remember  Jimmy Carter and putting the symbolic solar panels on the roof of the white house. Symbolizing the need for progress, the very progress Kisin  proclaims in this speech, was undermined by the Reagan Administration who as his first act in office was to remove this very symbol of progress now we are 40 years behind and then to defund the departments that worked to enhance clean energy. Don&#39;t blame wokism nor the poverty in South America and Asia, blame the right leaners for destroying progress which put the US 40 years behind the 8 Ball. While wokism has its issues the right is the true cancel culture of alternate energy. They weren&#39;t around during the failed Reagan administration."
That selfie sealed it 🤦‍♂️ Konstatin is a right GRIFTER! Piers left ITV on his own …. What a pair of Karens! Woke and Anti-woke are profiteering off stupid views!
A Brit and a Russian defending America.  That’s how f’ed up we are.
So woke people don&#39;t work...of course not...only you works! LOL
"The generations that complained non stop about gay people, about other religions, about single mothers, about pretty much everything now SURPRISE SURPRISE complains about the younger generations LOL"
If you externalize your emitssons to poor people countries then it is easy to say you are not responsible for the emissions I guess.

He&#39;s a bright man
The problem is the Woke don’t understand that they have corrupted their own brains. They don’t even see themselves as Woke and try to dismiss being called woke by saying it’s old and stupid. Just call them Neo-Woke that got corrupted from their original goals of working towards a common good for the oppressed and under represented  to hateful fascist racist for their own power.
The nice thing about this is that it gives you the hope that maybe the world won&#39;t turn into an insanely perverted place because of the woke.  It&#39;s terrifying.
"Question: why do we not offer to send (these so-called woke people), them to a country that better represent what the want, and offer that country (China, Russia and any other socialist and fascist country) a swap, we will take the ones who want to live in a democratic and free country."
this is the nest thing I&#39;ve heard in ages...!
"Ehhhh, wait a minute, you shouted down Tommy Robinson when he talked about the Qu&#39;ran, you didn&#39;t want to hear what he had to say, you just yelled at him Piers..."
Aware of political and social injustices...especially racism!<br>Finish the definition Piers!
Konstantin Kisin if you see this i think you are great!
Wokery jokery needs a boot pokery.
$70 a month just to read their content is a bit rich!  Trig are making a bloody fortune on the back of their anti Wokeness.  A bit like Meta I guess.
‘Basically are a form of fascist😂😂’
"if we abide by extreme left wing views and policies along with extreme right wing views we are in trouble - AND YES you left wing followers you are as bad as the right wing ,,,PS sorry piers you believe in god - religion is another extreme we could do with out"
It was a brilliant speech but the bone he threw them is based on a lie
Quite bigoted to the like of Piers and Kisin himself to abuse &#39;woke&#39; people. Do they even exist? Can someone seriously say that they subscribe to the &#39;woke&#39; mentality? Projection.
A brilliant speech by any standards. Thanks Konstantin.
great speech
I question climate change. Car&#39;s get the blame and hammer for climate change however very little is said of planes. Holiday makers around the world including cruising gets a free pass
"Thank You Piers Morgan for once again proving that your Channel is the place of safety, normality and comfort for the number of ordinary people that suddenly in todays world hsve been left outside and dont have many other spaces or just a home like this one-the home of freedom and logic in general factual thinking and intelligent and kind but powerful discussions.<br>So important today-in this overwhelming run of information and completely subjective, repeatedly blind against the ones of others and often aggressive and totally new or baseless narratives from multiple sides.<br><br>Thank You Mr. Piers Morgan and Mr. Konstantin ❤️👏💡<br>We all feel good being able to listen to such smart and educated adults but also and first of all just the non populistic and reflecting the common sense people 👍"
"i used to do drugs.  i still do, i just used to, too!"
As someone from eastern europe who also dealt with communism until a few 3 decades ago this is what the western world doesnt realize.<br><br>They dont realizes how dangerous this insane censorship can get because these idiots dont actually know what it means to actually live under an opressive government.<br><br>These phucken losers believe being mosgendered is opression for example
"The main thing is to save  energy! Ever thought of that? ?  Begin with private air condition at home, or in cars. Move your asses, instead of takin the car. Etc.."
"The idea that we are ruining the world is an old one.  Even the Bible in Revelations, God said he would destroy those &quot;ruining the Earth&quot;.  The problem is the way the &quot;woke&quot; crowd decides to do it.  The fact is that they don&#39;t have real power to enact change, they have no actual vote.  They can pressure companies to go along for a short time, but those companies will never change the fundamental core of how they pollute just to please this generations loud hippies.<br><br>  Of course if the world doesn&#39;t act, they can&#39;t complain if God does return to save us from ourselves, right when we are about to go extinct for not stopping the global damage to the planet.  I&#39;m not sure if it will happen in my lifetime, but so far the world is getting worse, more pollution can not be a good thing.  The Earth is finite and it can&#39;t take an infinite amount of abuse without there being consequences."
Loved his speech when I saw the whole of it. Another great interview Piers.
People don&#39;t ever acknowledge how perceptive a comedian has to be to create a routine.
Piers is still kind of an ass though … Declaring where Konstantin is going to film HIS OWN show.
"My name is Mahyar Radmehr, charged in August 2023 and facing 5 years in prison in Canada for having created a website exposing a female serial accuser by the name Sheida Khosroshahi with legally obtained documents who has charged and displaced men since 1997..Run the name sheida khosroshahi on Google  and see for yourself."
"Also, the Internet doesn&#39;t help by spreading this type of nonsense."
"Compare the brilliance of his speech in its entirety, with the several hundred televised versions of Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion word salad offerings - as nutritious as a can of spam or a box of kraft dinner. <br>Konstantin Kisin is a remarkable example of a true and powerful cultural diversity, the kind that made the west through most of the 20th century such a cornucopia of freedom of thought. <br>Great discussion, guys. Only wish it had extended longer. Needs another round or two."
It’s an amazing reality that the best comedy is the ridiculous Truth.  That’s why liberals fear memes.
"Piers Morgan always complains about the woke culture, yet he went super woke with Tommy Robinson about Islam. I have never heard him criticize how the woke culture empowering Islamic terrorism, not only towards the West, but towards Muslims and former Muslims who are part of the Islamic world even if they left it and are still a persecuted minority. Even in the UK by their Muslim families. Piers Morgan is either afraid of Muslims or he is a hypocrite"
"The problem with these types of free speech idiots is they take no personal responsibility for what they say. Most are really dumb, wokeness is about the equality of all, including speech, thought, expression and existence. It is not about cancelling, unlike these numbskulls advocating a few grifting words."
"The &#39;cleanest&#39; energy source ever devised is that derived from fossil fuels. It&#39;s staggering how brainwashed we&#39;ve become, demonizing carbon, carbon! the constituent element of all life on Earth! And to achieve the asinine goal of &#39;net zero&#39;  carbon emissions we&#39;ll chop down ALL trees, severely reduce arable land devoted to agriculture, relocate rural populations to  cities ... It&#39;s astonishing how destructive such plans are to Earth&#39;s environment, and it&#39;s being done deliberately."
"The first thing you have to do, is recognise your enemy.  WHO, is not only responsible for introducing it, BUT, who is feeding this sickness? And take it from there."
"Republicans criticize their own side a lot! Too much! As Rush used to say, “Democrats circle the wagons and Republicans shoot their wounded.”"
It will be interesting when these people get into the work place and start running for politics and change try to laws to meet their beliefs and realize it is not that easy.
We will absolute defeat wokeness.
"It&#39;s a cultural revolution, Maoism with western elements."
"people who dont believe in their selves ,ussualy go for some woke group of people to feel better ,but they cant see that theyre just brainwashed and lost ,my message love youre self and believe in yourself and you will look alot better in others eyes ,dont sell your soul to self loving people who wants world to bend"
Now after all that What are they going to do in the meantime  how many years will it take  all countries  will have to  be together about this A real challenge
Brilliant makes sense really impressed
"Wokeness, hopefully will be all gone within 4-5 years."
"If you go woke you go broke and stupid, not logical thinking, not an individual thinking is just have one learn speach that you repeat all over with no  opinion of your own cuz this is not your idea is a bad route that make you belive you are a victim and that you have to love just like that amd not try to be better just cry over all and mekw the rest equally stupid to follow. No thanks i like my brain and critical thinking."
The West is becoming far left. The communist Bolsheviks are in power. <br><br>Unless their is a reincarnation of Adolf Hitler it&#39;s going to get worse
🎉Thank You!!! YES!! Post Woke!! YES!! Pretty Stupid!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🤩
Can’t wait for that collaboration between the two of you 🙌🙌🙌
Human gas is loaded with greenhouse gases.  For God’s sake….STOP FARTING!!!
The woke mob are communists/ Marxists. Plain and simple.
Konstantin is fighting against the woke culture and therefore he deserves everyone&#39;s supports for that matter.
He is saying Latin America and Asia are responsible for environmental issue. Hope this idiot gets some history lesson with fact. Your so-called west manufacturing is done in Asia and Latin America.
Woke will destroy itself. Fanatics always do. Just a question of how many they take down with them...
He the of the bat that poor people couldn&#39;t give a f about saving the planet. The audacity.
"keen insights, robust arguments and irrefutable logic"
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
guy looks like the anoerexic vladimir klitschko
Great debate!
"Morgan is crying woke because people like him no longer have absolute monopoly of the media like before.<br>People now can freely express their own view on social media and be heard unlike when the MSM had absolute power to control people’s mind.<br>He’s not used to being challenged or opposed to, opposing his views easily translates to being CANCELLED.<br>Megan merkel issue and the Ukrainian-Russian war is an example of that."
"There&#39;s such a Sinister feeling to it all. And I always wondered who funds these people where do they get their money? Someone has to pay for transportation, t-shirts signs bull horns.

"More and more everyday, all those rumors I heard about a new world order seem to be materializing right before my eyes.

I support the speakers on educating youth rather than demonizing them. Woke culture has done nothing but harm. I do disaree with the comment on carbon footprint though. The reason why Asia and South America are responsible for high carbon emission is because North America and Europe has shifted majority of their production to these countries for reduced cost.
He seems woke to me an activist discussing a practical solution to climate change
"Republicans want to control where you shop, where you eat, what you can buy, what to think and who you can make live to. It is 1930’s Germany."
You can’t defeat something if you don’t even know what it is or should even be defeated.
"I&#39;m not woke, but I&#39;m a leftist. And he&#39;s spitting bullshit that only morons would actually take for facts. First of all, making changes to the way we consume is what would bring positive climate change, the west is the biggest consumer of Chinese products. So the West is indeed responsible for China being the biggest polluter in the world. And if the West had any good intentions, they would boycott products that are not responsibly produced. And that would actually make China prosper even more as they can start selling these products at higher margins. These studies that show the biggest polluters in the world don&#39;t take into account when a country contributes to another countries pollution. For example, the biggest consumer of Chinese products is the US. Therefore, the US should be considered the biggest polluter and not China."

"Fuck the planet! (GB is 2% of TODAYS emissions, amazing how he forgets how they got RICH."
That&#39;s why wizards that will figure out how to make clean energy cheaply are greater than the prophets that prescribe inefficient protesting.
most important speech in the last 6 months ever!
"This should be shown to the New Zealand government.  And ex Prime minister Jacinda Ardern.  She tried to be St Greta of Thundaberg greatest campaigner, companion. Stupid b#$ch. So many people lost jobs , and they imported crap stuff from overseas cos it was cheaper."
This guy knocks it right out of the park… Superbly spoken….
The music is disturbing.
"Laughter and truth matter. At least Kisin got the laughter right. Homo sapiens are defined by stories, not truth. One story has taken us further than any other. That story has changed our world to the point where &quot;we are in the fight of our lives&quot;. That story is the money story. The problem is not that we have too many left wing nutters or too many right wing nutters or too many &quot;woke&quot; people or too many religious fanatics. The problem is the money story. We need to reconstruct our money story to ensure the survival of Homo sapiens by constructing a story based on Earth&#39;s true currency - air, water, soil, biodiversity and energy. This is a monumental task. It may be that only AI can take us there. We have to recognise that we are an inseparable part of the Earth&#39;s ecosystem. This is the truth that matters more than any other. If Kisin truly cares for his son, he must face this truth now. To all of us, if we truly care for our children and their children and their children and their children, we must face this truth now."
Konstantin is one of the great men
It’s Sherlock!
"At the 4 minute mark, why did you edit the speech.  In his actual speech, after he said that “about 15 months ago my wife got pregnant”, he followed that with a comical line that she got pregnant, not him, because they are old fashioned.  What’s wrong with that statement?  People in the hall laughed, I did too.  It’s strange that someone edited the line out."
"so if I am going to distill his argument down, it would read something like, fix poverty through technology and that will do a lot to curbing the advance of what he perceives as the negative effects of climate change?  Am I hearing him right and not getting myself all confused?  great....then he better hope that technology helps us skip the step where the poor of china and India get cheap cars....In the extraordinarily short history of the human race when have technological breakthroughs EVER been either CLEAN or CHEAP?   This is a load of bollocks.  I am nearly 50 and I have no love lost for the woke or the asleep, or the right/left, or the republican/democrat.  it is all just a diversion and division tactic if you were to ask me, but this speech is not so much inspiring as it&#39;s a load of bollocks"
I&#39;ve seen this great speech many times. You need to turn the music down. It&#39;s distracting. Thank you.
Unnecessary annoying stupid music. We don’t need to be manipulated. Grow up.
Please leave out the stupied music when you post...annoying and distracting.
This Speak should every Buddy alert that we all fight the same fight about survival.
"This is what intelligence sounds like, for those of you who have never heard the sound before...Listen close, very close and free your mind so that your butt can follow."
A shame about the annoying soundtrack someone decided to put under it. Wtf???
"the gay totally misses the point. To say that someone else is doing wrong does it mean we can do it as well? If others engage in wars all over the world and people will die anyway does it mean we can do it? And more importantly, by putting pressure and fighting for decorbanization, we force investors and scientis to work faster on technological progress."
"Why did you cut the harmless joke, „About 15 months ago my wife got pregnant. Not me, cause we&#39;re old school&quot;, you want people to watch the video but you censor it yourself, that&#39;s pathetic :-)"
&quot;THE SPEECH THAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT&quot; - did it &#39;break the internet&#39;  LMAO
"NUKE  THE  EARTHS CORE AS WE DID IN 45 56? HOPE THIS HELPS  AND 63 CAUSING THE MANTLE TO CRACK ALLOWING THE COLD OCEANS TO COOL THE PLANETSS CORE .WE THEN HAD THE FREEZING WINTERS OF 45 56? AND 63,THIS LATEST TEST FROZE THE SEA AROUND THE UKs COAST. WE THEN HAD A SLOW CLIMB IN CLIMATIC HEAT  PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE PLANETS 23.5 AXIS TILT. Ihope this helps you scientists that do not understand the earths relentless evolution.   Bob."
"&#39;&#39;Smash that Button&#39;&#39; what a powerful statement, so true having been in poverty and raising a child."
"Great video, but I couldn&#39;t focus on the music because that idiot in the background kept talking! Please turn the music volume way up in future videos 🙏"
"it&#39;s called priorities and young people don&#39;t have them....they have ideas of others branded into them, but they will wake up...and when they do....depression, drugs/sex addiction and suicide awaits them because they&#39;ve learned nothing on their own and have been shielded from safe suffering which every child needs to become resilient, strong and successful. The last 2 Gen&#39;s have been destroyed by left insanity posing as virtuous. Sad times."
What a bright person.. Wonderful... All young people should be hearing this ebety month st school👍
"Im 52, and still will never bring a child of my own into this world!<br>Why would i want my child to suffer because of others!?"
"People in western countries dont understand how many tires are burnt in certain countrie every single day going up into your air,and the reason they do it, yup,its because they are poor looking for what WE THE PEOPLE of the planet throw away!!!<br>Not one person is even close to being awake!!!"
So so so sad this only has 2 million views. Soooo sad.
DAMN GOOD SPEECH
Shut the music off. Very distracting.
One the most inspiring and truth filled speeches I&#39;ve heard in my lifetime  !! ❤❤
That was deep..... really DEEP 👏👏👏👏
Liar. Complete and utter obfuscation.
"I sit back and wait to see when the world will waken up and do what they don&#39;t want to do, which is to change! I don&#39;t want to sit back, I want to stand up with the people and change, but I fear I&#39;ll always be in the same position, sitting back, waiting to see when the world will waken up and do what they don&#39;t want to do!"
"The world is at the apex of selfishness. <br>😢😢😢<br>Here in America, people don&#39;t even know how programmed they are to be selfish.<br>i.e.,,,,,<br>Cars almost never give the pedestrian the right of way.<br>In one of the richest counties in the USA. <br>Trump will be re-elected. <br>He is already courting hard line right wing fascists.<br>But I believe that God is allowing this mess until the time that HE will end this. 😢😢😢"
I argue that a third of India do not live in India at all but live in New Zealand
"I appreciate what this man says. I don’t believe in Climate Change and Never Will. For you all who let the music bother you, or think this man doesn’t know what he is doing ~ please rethink and find some common sense!"
Who is this man?
"Powerful speech! I wish if he mentioned something about the starvation &amp; Holocaust in Gaza concentration camp, and the ecocide going on due to the American &amp; European weapon &amp; bombs used."
What a waste if time listening to this man of little knowledge and about growing up
Climate change is a hoax of the US  and European. They destroyed huge acreages of trees everywhere and now want the underdeveloped countries to not do the same as they did
"Brilliant speech, should be compulsory viewing in every Australian university, and on continuous playback in Parliament House"
Good ones
"Please switch off the awful music, I can barely hear what he&#39;s saying."
"The GOD I love, the Creator of our Universe is the only one that can allow this planet to exist without any human interference. He alone will control this universe."
The woke care more about “feelings” more than “the truth.” Lol.
The music is insipid as is this man who knows who he is selling this hogwash to. No facts no knowledge. Low grade sludge fuel used in maritime transportation is one of the huge factors in air pollution for instance.
Common sense.
"Why did you delete his line &quot;Not me, because I&#39;m old school&quot;, referring to his wife&#39;s pregnancy?"
"Great speech, indeed! While I hope deep down that by some miracle it will have an effect on zombies who make up the woke community, all the facts at hand tell me it&#39;s a waste of time... you might as well hold this speech in a forest, with the trees, the effect would be similar... Brilliant man, though."
I can’t understand how such nonsense could appeal to so many people. What he says is a real manipulation of public opinion<br><br>￼
"I actually agree that getting rid of the word &quot;woke&quot; would be just fine, because all of the social and environmental problems would (unfortunately) remain the same, with or without that label.<br><br>In fact, isn&#39;t &quot;woke&quot; actually a word that&#39;s used as an insult, by conservatively orientated people, in order to try to make compassionate qnd open hearted people feel uncertain about trusting the genuineness of their feelings?  Isn&#39;t &quot;woke&quot;, as an insult, a way of attempting to intimidate?  If a person talks about &quot;my facts &#39;versus&#39; your feelings&quot;; to what &quot;facts&quot; do they refer?  Obfuscating, nitpicking &quot;facts&quot;, designed to slow down the genuine need for momentum, when acting upon a genuinely urgent situation?<br><br>I&#39;m writing this comment, after watching the first few minutes of this video, so my comment may not be specifically applicable to this presentation; although I believe that what I&#39;ve written is generally true."
Why would you make the music so loud you can&#39;t hear the speaker?
"Did the Oxford bring in a rebuttal? Otherwise, &quot;Debate Club&quot; really misinforms one in the English language. My wife and I, &quot;Boomers,&quot; never brought children into this world. We <i>adopted</i> two. There, that&#39;s my virtue-signaling bit. One other thing, refuse to allow any person&#39;s actions become the <i>measure</i> of your morals. Therein lies the easy path to sanctimoniousness...<br>Be well."
"Technological advances have saved humans time and time again, but with all technology it can be used for good and evil, hence we Nobel prizes, dynamite used in industrial mining a good thing, in bombs not so good, cars, vans, lorries replaced the horse, put produce emissions"
"Give me a break.  They say that most facts are made up on the spot, and this guy is an example of that.  Out of the 209 countries listed on the world&#39;s Carbon monitoring site Gr. Britain is the 17th highest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world.  <br><br>It&#39;s not about the U.S. and Gr. Britain making a difference by &quot;sinking into the sea,&quot; simply because the main climate change countries, &quot;the poor&quot; as he puts it, are South and Central America.  He says that &quot;they,&quot; the poor countries, are the ones responsible for climate change, and, as he states, &quot;poor people don&#39;t give a shit about climate change.&quot;  The truth is that the very countries he sites as being the most pollutive are actually among the least pollutive.  The further truth is that the people who are the least responsible for the problem are the ones that suffer from it the most.    <br><br>Beyond that, war is the single highest carbon emitter on the planet... it&#39;s ironical then that most of the wars being fought are started by the U.S. and Gr. Britain and are wars for resources in the very countries that he cites as being &quot;the problem.&quot;  The truth is that in a variety of ways, our highly mechanized, gas guzzling societies, and our war-like posture throughout the world, means that the U.S. and Gr. Britain have, more than any other country&#39;s on earth, been responsible for these countries being poor.  It is our colonialistic foreign policies that have been the determinants of these country&#39;s fate.  The U.S. and Gr. Britain could help these countries combat climate change, not only by example, (by doing our part), but also by lifting our oppressive thumbs off of them.  <br><br>The speech that everyone is talking about?  Hardly.  Nobody I know is talking about it... it&#39;s not worth talking about.  In fact, climate change is just one of many of the failing systems within the realm of what&#39;s called &quot;ecological overshoot&quot; (put that into your search engine)-- where many of the earths systems have reached the point of no return and are collapsing to the point to where they can no longer sustain the population.  Climate change is only a small part of this.  <br><br>This guy&#39;s full of shit, and if you believe anything he has to say you&#39;re as easily led as they come.   <br><br>Worldometer worldwide carbon monitoring meter--  <a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-by-country/#google_vignette"">https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-by-country/#google_vignette</a>"
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
What an almost impossibly stupid prat. I bet mummy&#39;s so proud of him !
Thanks!
"This is what the right wing bullshit sounds like.  Sorry, but you are NOT the first who said it JUST LIKE THIS..."
shameless dressing downof kids by a grown man
Brilliant! although I don’t agreed all what he said
Deliver the message without the music!   I switched off.
Is the music necessary?
He taks like a Goebbels… does not espouse necessary morals… he seems to take pride in his negatuvity and screw looking for the correct answer… just deliver his privilege.
perspective and delivery.....both outstanding...
"An amazing example of social engineering at its finest. The truth is we have all the tech needed for zero carbon free electric etc… we have all the tech needed for free unlimited clean water for the entire world and for food. All of that is available but we are not given that. Why? Because the elites don’t want to loose control and can’t accept that they, we, are all the same and the only difference between us and them is knowledge of the truth. Just like now they are trying to associate the people who are waking up and starting  to find out what’s going on as WOKE and that all they do is complain and want to be lazy and live in a sick fantasy world. That’s not true. Waking up and seeing through the deception is the truth and what they do not want"
WOKIES aid the enemies and corrupt ruin their own country to yell and scream to waste and distract everyone from the real problems that are being done to the country.
"You has million kid has no food and city is getting bankrupt <br><br>For Eastern large country please go there and see <br>People have enough food. <br><br>has the technology to build new and clean energy and cheap. <br><br>is doing for the climate change more than the west. <br><br>The west is using other countries made items, to cut out the pollution, so if the west is using the poor countries made, you are part of the pollution"
আসসালামুয়ালাইকুম ইয়াহিয়া আমিন স্যার আপনি কেন আপনার প্রায় সব ভিডিওর কমেন্ট সেকশন অফ করে রাখছেন একজন সাইকিয়াট্রিক হয়ে যদি আপনি কোন ধরনের সমালোচনা সহ্য না করতে পারেন তাহলে আপনি যারা দুর্বল প্রকৃতির লোক মানে যাদের ধৈর্য শক্তি কম তাদেরকে আপনি কিভাবে মানসিক স্বাস্থ্য সম্পর্কে এডভাইস দেবেন যদি আপনার নিজেরই মানসিক স্বাস্থ্য মানে ধৈর্য শক্তি কম থাকে আসলে আপনার প্রতি আমার অনেক শ্রদ্ধা ভক্তি ছিল কিন্তু দিনে দিনে সেটা কমে আসছে প্রফেশনাল জগতে টিকে থাকতে হলে আপনাকে গালি এবং তালি দুটোই সহ্য করতে হবে দুঃখিত আপনার মত একজন জ্ঞানী মানুষ কে জ্ঞান দেওয়ার জন্য 😅
Brilliant speech
I can end this right now without all the fine words...<br><br>Climate Change is a HOAX to put fear in everyone while the few at the top cash in on OUR misery and stupidity...
Why not have this brilliant speech translated into as many languages as possible- and let it be broadcast  far and wide - all across our world!JaiHind!
Wow this guy explains things where we can understand it. Omg who is this guy never seen him or heard about him before
Well that changed a lot.
Turn down the damn background music.
"it sounds lame, to me..."
Spectacular speech!!!!
FANTASTIC  !
"I want to be mad, I want to be angry.....but I am among the poor of America; I live on $900 a month.  I do NOT want to be this poor but life has worked that out for me spectacularly and I am left at nearly 60yo with no retirement, no 401k, no funeral benefits.  I plan on giving my body away for parts and whatever else they can use of it.  I never have believed in cemetaries or funerals.  Use what you can, cremate the rest and make a pendant out of the leftover.<br>Point is that I have always been a social justice warrior and I wanted to hate this man, and his words BUT I CANNOT DENY HIS TRUTHS.   HE SAYS IT ALL SPECTACULARLY!! <br><br>It is unfortunate that in my country being woke has come to mean things that it isn&#39;t; what is even more unfortunate is that most of those against &quot;woke&quot; cannot even define it nor would they recognize it if they did see it because to them being woke means<br><br>LGBTQI friendly or allied,<br>Books about sex written for teenagers and young adults, <br>The beautiful diversity of our country and our planet,<br>And anything that isn&#39;t identified as evangelical Christian friendly.<br><br>You see these people aren&#39;t Christian anymore; in my country, they are Trumpers or as I like to call them MAGATs because they like to destroy lives and ruin people and then revel in what their hate has wrought.<br><br>Our world has a lot of problems but this gentleman says it quite rightly; the poor do not want to be or remain poor and if we want a world at all then instead of trying to leave it like Elon Musk, we need to work on providing clean ways of operating the systems of social movement."
This was not the end of woke but the begining of the end. Thanks konstinine we owe you.
Why the bloody music.???
Reasonable people know the ans
Salute
Wow
One of the most important speeches ever!
"Because there are many poor people in the world does not mean that we should not go on reminding people about the dangers of climate change. It is the fault of capitalism and communism. Trillions and trillions of dollars (or other currencies) are spent every year to kill people!!! Perhaps if we made better use of that money there would be fewer poor people. I notice that the speaker used communist countries to talk about poor people. There are just as many poor in capitalist countries like say Brazil, or India - and many more in Africa, Central America."
Common sense at last
1 in 10 comments are hateful 9 in 10 niceful 😅
Makes to much sense thats just not cricket 😅
"You cut off and edited some parts, let the whole thing play without omission"
Brilliant speech. Well said mate.👏👏👏👏👏👏
Mediocre and arrogant speech with a supremacy that is deteriorating day by day.
❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mbdp51O0J6Q&amp;t=150"">2:30</a>  Most people - worldwide - suffer from malnutrition - including the middle and upper class - they just don&#39;t realize it"
Great speech. <br>Nothing changes reality more than the application of the old rule: &quot;Put your money where your mouth is&quot;. <br>.
