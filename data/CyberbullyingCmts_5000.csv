Average YouTube apology video:
"As a former wr holder, I can confirm, this is a crazy time"
Why are your hands covered in fecal mater
Trump  could not spell  the word ELOQENT and would not know what it means. I am Danish speaks 4 foreign languages learning the fifth in Florida we need to learn Espanol
The only one who is mentally impeared and digusting and shameless is this psychopath trump
"Man, what a psychopath. There is something evil about him."
You people are straight lying Donald Trump cares about America and only America he don't care about any other country
The fly is hanging around him cuz of the stench from his soiled Depend diaper no doubt about that.
"This jerk can’t even say her name correctly so who is dumb, stupid and illiterate."
The darkness of his rhetoric is the state of his mind:  MADNESS; a very dark place where he hides now from the truth.  He’s going down and can not accept his failures. God help his followers who are right there with him.
"If only white men were allowed to vote, his remarks may win this for him. Fortunately, those days are over. I’ve mailed my ballot. Vote BLUE!"
"Trump tends to project his feelings about himself onto others. That’s what everyone is missing, when they talk about how great Trump is."
"Listening to Trump kills brain cells.  Obviously, listening to himself has caused total shutdown of his brain!  He sounds old, tired, full of lies, badly misinformed, and backed by 'a few hangers-on left over frim January 6th!'  He states that so many can't speak English; has he listened to himself lately.  Talk about a failure!"
"ah yes i see the liberal media is still going with the ""trump is racist"" even though he never said anything racist in this entire video. the people in these comments agreeing with this video are the same people who support communism socialism and abolishing the constitution so it is really no surprise that trumps scares them."
The problem is the justice system let's him say what he wants and judges want do anything about it we all gonna die if he gets in because he is sick racist enough to start a nuclear war
He is just so sickening to look at and listen to. Donald Trump is the dumbest president ever.
Why is it that cities that have majority minorities are accused of cheating. He is such a racist.
Typical bias and bigoted comments from nbc and it’s sheeple audience!..
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao-Dsq5OJTA&t=253"">4:13</a> <b>so ""NOBODY"" in Springfield Ohio can speak English now, eh??</b>"
"🤔Trump keeps reflecting on himself, he likes to talk about himself, we guess. 🙄"
Where is the racist part?
"Trump is disgusting and I don't understand how people listen to him. Man, why can't people see how corrupt he is. He is using peoples fears to  promote hatred and propaganda. He stoops so low its is like looking like a scary clown. Demeaning Kamala and also people who have mental disabilities is so disgusting. Kamala does not need to react to Trump he is digging his own grave with his stupidity and arrogance. I am a Christian and I can't stand how Trump is manipulating and using gullible Christians. Trumps threat for one hour of violence is enough for him to be removed as a candidate and not only that he lied so much about voter fraud that he should not be allowed to run as a candidate."
I hope nbc is over when trump wins this election
Didn't Conald say he was going to build a wall and let Mexico pay for it? Never happened
Donald Trump is the LESSER evil the left side is way worst. So Trump got my vote 2024.
i just saw a rally where he says Everything Kamala touches turns to Sh...t.....and I dont mean to use that word but it is fitting isn't it?
philadelphia seriously one of thee worsts places in the usa and it's suppose to be important
The only moments his  fans give him applause is when he talk bad about others. Because thats the only thing he can and only thing they understand.
"and here we go again, Trump priming his cabal for election result denial because he knows it's over for him..."
Can you prosecute yourself?
The orange 7urd is completely out of his deranged mind abd btw a fly always find its way to the  💩
SO   tired  of  Despicable  DJT 👎‼️
Trump 2024. Those cheating in elections will be prosecuted. I love to hear that. Democrats are panicking
I didn't hear one thing he said that was racist. You're trying a little bit too hard to save your Democrat bosses. He pretty much had every nail on the head
You ever seen Mark for Death movie.if Harris wins I'm mark for death..vote trump
Hes finished. Coward wont even debate on the network he agreed to. Got fact checked and got caught in numerous lies. What a pathetic orange globster
is he sane<br>who is impaired<br>what a sad state of usa
"Trump’s supporters are very unserious people who obviously wants some sort of comedy in a president of the U.S.  God will be Trump’s vote tabulator, because he will lose, and will be held accountable for his crimes.  I pray Trump will live to face each and every indictment in the court system."
"Come on America you are allowing a racist to spew division, racism, Hate and inciting violence he should be in Jail!!! He is a cesspit of bile..."
Con 45 is a crazy POS...soooo glad when he's gone....what a nightmare this man has been for America.
This dude is straight insane 😮😢
LIARS LIARS LIARS EVIL INIQUITY WORKING LIARS
Trump is the man !!!!@ media IA a disgrace kamala needs t be the president of a dog pound hahahahs
"The only hope to save the United States from crime, lawlessness and anarchy is Mr Trump."
Clearly mentioned cities with 90% black population
The only person that is mentally impaired is DONALD TRUMP
Please vote 🇺🇸 … from a concerned Australian
The day Biden took office.  Unbelievable. The millions that Biden-Harris let invade our borders illegally need Healthcare too. We didn't have the support in place. Just like we are not ready for 100% EV. You can't get in to see a Dr. for months and longer now. Consequences are too high. They need to be prosecuted.
Trump 2024 ❤
"When Harris wins I hope you get arrested for cheating  and prosecuted ,your words Trump"
orange buffoon should tell Kamala Harris husband that. I bet he doesnt have the guts to do that
You just know everyone in that crowd says the R word.
Is this the Black Entertainment Network?
"2014 Cambridge Analytica scandal- Steve Bannon got your Facebook algorithm and created a database of all Americans 2016 they had been altering feeds to push people who were susceptible to alt-right fascist. They all had to pay fees. 2024 Zuckerberg says he was pressured to censor 2024/2025 Meta has a class action lawsuit before pro alt-right Supreme Court. Republicans block border bill they co wrote bc they are trying to force executive overreach to create a dictatorship. It was intentionally done, the representatives shirked their duty. White population is approximately 58 percent. Most are past reproductive age. High death rate caused by white suicide by gun. Low birth rate currently .8. This is a hail mary attempt."
trump2024
Trump 2024
So sick of Trump. He’s disgusting.
Dude ain't racist m. Stop lying!
"Trump is talking about himself he saying that’s he is mental, Trump 2024 jail America be great again"
Im racist too. Only thing I like about him
President Trump for America 🇺🇸
This election is a referendum on the strength of American principles vs treasonous liars.
"What Garbage Network.  DC following the UN push to take immigrants is a problem.  We are not required by any moral requirement to take in an unhealthy amount of Migrants.  Trying to create amnesty in 60 days ignores the ability to properly assimilate peoples from other ideologies.   Protecting your Nation from illegal and or to much legal migration is a requirement, not racist.  Regardless if someone is from Ireland or Trinidad Trabego matters not.   Prioer vetting, proper evaluation  if a Person will be a benefit or a Liability are also important considerations."
"I hate that this man-child constantly complains about ""cheating."" He's what almost 80yrs old and he still doesn't talk like an adult. He still acts like a child. It's so f-king annoying"
He is so vile and disgusting.  He has no manners whatsoever.
Trump - look that word up in any dictionary.
This isn't considered media anymore. This is just propaganda by the toilet bowl of America. MSNBC. Right there with the View!! Disgusting
Candace Owens says Kamala isn't even black.  This is going to get embarrassing for the Dems.  That is tonight's news complete with recordings.
The fly is there because he probably pooped his pants
"NO one cheats like the great #45.  He was born a cheater, and a liar.  Anybody would know this.  There, #45, I fixed it for  you."
I can’t wait until the cheaters get prosecuted! Trump 2024!🇺🇸
Why is his hair purple ????
What a negative individual.
The fly came from Trump's former Vice President's hair
Horrifying! And horrifying for crowds that cheer. And for media that don't report on this kind of behavior. He's plain nuts!
Awe 😢Mr. Projection is throwing another pitter-patter tantrum. Kamala hasTRAUMATIZED him!!😱🤯💩😅Mr. Insecure !!😵‍💫🫠🥴😆😂
"Harris is a mental toddler who's never accomplished anything except lying. Trump was a better president than Joe. Oh yeah, give Ukraine US Taxpayer money but not to UD Taxpayer"
Trash + Park 😂
What did she do?
Trump is utterly ignorant.
White guys for Harris? 😂Kamala Harris is a racist liar.<br>I vote for peace & prosperity again.
"A born looser, he is"
Sick
"I am surprised that Donald Trump has not talked about a new law forbidding all men from having a vasectomy,,, I'm surprised it's not even talked about in that 2025 book put out by heritage"
Trump has a fly bc he stinks.  😮
"The fact that Trump is extraordinarily racist is not the problem. He has always been racist. The fact that tens of millions of Americans adore him, adore his racism, and WANT this racist fool to turn America into a hate based nation- THAT is a problem that is not easily solved or will go away."
Trump is scared of her. She is kicking his behind. All of the out if control places is kicking his but. He know he's losing and going to jail. He's flipping out.
"WE ALL KNOW BY NOW,  that a judge in California knew Kamala's father and he talked to her father who  said she is NOT BLACK.<br>How many times do people have to repeat that?"
He is a fool and uneducated!! It’s sooo sad that you people in America would even consider supporting him just listen to him!!! Smh 🤦🏾‍♂️ I can’t wait to vote and it definitely will not be for trump!!!!!
Thinking of Trumps actions and words I am reminded of Hitler <br><br><br>and the Civil War The North and South.  As well as<br>He’s love this to be the divided states like his first term. <br>This is the United States Not the Divided States of America
Truly a despicable man!
He is Dumb and his supporters are Dumber!!!!
Anyone supporting this creature is NOT a true American.  They are a selfish traitor whose ideals and beliefs take precedent over democracy and core values.
"Look at this man and his running mate, they exude evil and hate."
More lies from these two idiots. 🙄
Trump is such a loose cannon!  God help American…seriously 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
This is incredibly sad. How is this type of demeaning and slanderous narrative allowed in any country? If the USA sets the template for the wider developed world then we are in trouble.
Malignant criminal Trump 😊
I could never have imagined that the greatest nation of the world would have a large part of its population so thick as to believe in Trump's endless nonsensical rambling and even applaud. There's definitely something wrong with the country.
"Thanks for the Open Borders,  The Fentanyl Crisis and Venezuelan Gangs Border Czar"
TRUMP IS A POLITICAL CULT LEADER.   😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Trump still wants that greasy dictatorship to keep himself out of jail. trump is the criminal 😊
"It’s Something Wrong With You, the worst thing you don’t even REALIZE How STUPID you really Are 👺👺👺👺👺😡"
"She and President Joe Biden have failed to secure our nation's southern border, plain and simple. Unlike a lot of issues, this one is not complicated − four more years of Harris will be four more years of the same border chaos.<br>Kamala record is atrocious .<br><br>Believe Kamala Harris, she has shown you who she is.<br>1. Pro-abortion up to and post-birth <br>2. Will close all illegal alien detention centers<br>3. Supports open borders<br>4. Supports amnesty for the approximate 60 million illegal aliens already in the U.S.<br>5. Was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act causing inflation to skyrocket<br>6. Is against fracking<br>7. Supports the eradication of oil, natural gas, and coal as energy sources<br>8. Supports Medicare-for-all, eradicating all private insurance<br>9. Supports price-fixing for Medicare drug perscriptions (Ie, rationing)<br>10. Supports policies resulting in young people no longer being able to buy a home<br>11. Supports government set price controls on food and services<br>12. Supports the war in Ukraine and Israel as a means of shifting wealth from the middle-class to the elite-class<br>13. Hates Israel<br>14. Supports Hamas<br>15. Has supported Bidenomics decimating the U.S. economy<br>16. Has supported policies that result in rising crime<br>17. Supports defunding police"
He is soooo afraid of her😂
"Vote for Trump you don’t have any other choice, can someone tell me something good she (Kamala) did for our country in the last 31/2 years in power?!"
And yet still some black and Latino voters support this RACIST ranting lunacy?  Totally incomprehensible.
"from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao-Dsq5OJTA&t=63"">1:03</a> thru <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao-Dsq5OJTA&t=115"">1:55</a> He's is absolutely right !! JUST he mentioned the wrong name. Should've been ""Trump"" each time he said Kamala. In that case it would've been spot on. WHAT A SICK MAN."
Thanking everyone voting blue.  💙💯
All stupid
This guy soul is trouble he will have a serious time when he have to give an account to God. The guy is very weird and lies so much.
"The Republicans are done. Over, forget about it."
Donald Trump is the biggest joke and the biggest danger to our democracy.
And it's a close race? Really? Half of America thinks this grifting conman is admirable. Jesus save us.
Again. Why isn't this criminal locked up.
Most disgusting individuals EVER
ABSOLUTELY CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE ATTACKED THE CAPITAL RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND!!!! NOT ARRESTED!!!😅😂🤣😅😂🤣😅😂🤣
He’s afraid he’ll lose and end up in prison.
😂😂😂😂
"Talk about PROJECTION. There's only 1 person in this race incapable of pronouncing the other's name. Talk about ""stupid""! Give me a break!"
"Look into Curtis Yarvin who is cited by Vance. Vance says he wants to cut out parts of government ""like a tumor"" by electing a dictator who would do this. He wants to fire university faculty and sell their ""attractive campuses"" to real estate developers. Kind of important for people to know."
washing youself helps against flys...
"I hope there are enough Haitians & Jamaicans in Florida, who are offended by Trump, that they will vote to flip Florida to Blue. All that is needed is 400,000 votes. Karma is a powerful thing... If Florida flips, there is little chance for Trump to win."
"It's such a bad speech you would think it was satire or some kind of parody. Just an angry, bitter, hateful, little old man."
"Notice Trumo reserves his comments of stupid and low IQ statements to those who are black, showing Trump's blatant.<br>Although I focused on Trump's out of bounds rascist comments to Kamala Harris who is not only Trump's political opponent, but at the samr time our vice president,  i do not wish in any way minimize the outright hateful and dangerous baseless rasist comments and accusations against all people of color and differing nationalities.  All his comments must be condemned in the strongest ways possible."
"This is so disturbing, Trump can't say any facts or give evidence to support his claims so he results to insults and lies. Pathetic"
First he say they're stupid people then that they're smart
"If you don’t think Donald Trump is a racist, you’re either in denial or a racist yourself, period. <br><br>Sad to know someone like that can run for the highest office in America and actually win. Says a little something about most Americans in this country. <br><br>Thank goodness Jesus Christ has the final say with the world and Donald’s life. Every believer and Christian all over the world please pray very hard for Mr. Trump that he may see the error of his ways, for one day he WILL be judged by our father and creator of all. <br><br>Jesus loves every one of his children including Donald, so I hope he can change his heart and turn his life around before it’s too late. Remember, going to church or putting money in the offering plate on Sunday doesn’t make you a Christian, so Trump can’t use that card. <br><br>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done; on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.<br><br>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me."
The courts says that they didncheat already
"When I saw the first debate between Harris and Trump, saw white vs color. In other words, white on the outside3, darkness on the inside. dark on the outside, light on the inside."
President Harris you doing  great. I worry about her because Trump get worse everyday protect Lord
There are many traitors in this country. They're all at Trump rallies.
IS MSNBC GOING TO SUPPORT  300 MILLION AND MORE AMERICANS?  <br>WHAT IS YOUR PLAN?  <br>KAMALA'S PLAN IS TO TAKE BILLIONS FROM OUR BUSINESSES AND USE IT TO MAKE THEMSELVES (DEMOCRAT LIFELONG BUREAUCRATS) LOOK GOOD WHEN THEY HAVE NOT CONTRIBUTED ANYTHING - BUT THEY SURE HAVE TAKEN US TAXES.
"The way Trump paints the American carnage, nobody can fix it, even the Orange himself. According to Trump, America is the worse country on earth! Who wants to run this dirty USA?!"
"Trump is NOT CRAZY.  He is a businessman and our country runs on BUSINESS taxes!  
<br>When will you get that through your heads?  
<br>Kamala has been supported by taxes for most of her working life - so has Biden.
<br>When will you UNDERSTAND the most basic elements of our economy?
<br>WHERE WOULD ANYONE GET THE MONEY TO RUN A TRILLION DOLLAR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT - NOT TO MENTION ALL THE OTHER GOVERNMENTS.  IF IT WERE NOT FOR BUSINESSES WHO EMPLOY MILLIONS?
<br>FORMER GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE,
<br>LEI
<br>BACHELOR OF SCIENCE - SOCIOLOGY"
You are smarter than this lunatic. Don't be trumped.
Wait!!!  A fly???  Is that because his diaper is full of 💩????
An investigation needs to be done for the education system in red states.  The lack of rational thinking is truly terrifying.<br>DonnyOLD is decaying and attracting more flies
What is he on???
Biden-Harris Administration Has Intentionally Left Us Vulnerable allowing illegal migrants to invade our country . They should be criminally charged. You filtered lying news is why our country is a disaster. Can you imagine Harris making foreign policy?  God help us.
Trump is a radical communist dictator. Trump is a mentally disturbed individual.   Something is seriously wrong with Trump. Trump mouth is out of control.
Trump is a very bad person 🤬. He needs to go to a jail.
"So, donnie, are you running away from debating a ""mentally disabled person""? Interesting!"
There is a difference between freedom of speech and hate speech and lies - this is the latter
she never was voted into a government position always appointed tells you alot about her
"Another war brewing, hurricane devastation, long shore man strike, inflation, do we really want do nothing hyena in charge .  Are we Americans or American'ts. She is not a leader of men."
This is exactly how hitler got started
Jamal sucks
Can't understanding myself. There should be a wide gap in this election  towards harris. WE'VE got some crazy people . He mentions GOD?!!! HOW DARE HE!!! BETTER WATCH OUT TRUMP HOW YOU TALK ABOUT GOD. JUST LISTEN TO HIM?!!! DO YOU REALLY WANT A PRESIDENT LIKE THIS?
Impossible to understand for no Americans.. 360 million people and the best they can pick up as candidates to Presidency are a completely crazy guy and an eternally laughing lady with zero charisma. Amazing!
Republicans are finished!
I've noticed msnbc and NBC only report bad about Trump and they TRY  to make Kamala look good. He told the truth about the immigrants.
Can you hear the sick people in the background. 😢
"This Want be dictator, and his cult followers are crazy 🤪."
We should be e calling out the people who clap and praise his retoric
"This goes to show us how crazy are delusional Trump is. He’s always telling on himself. People really need to listen at the nut, his brain is gone. All he’s running on is hatred and violence. What a shame!"
Now they are concerned kind of late in the game
Stop playing that monkey.... You guys give him power by continuously playing his words.
The fly is from the omen
Your wife Mr Trump can't speak English
This old criminal will not succeed his try to steal the election. This guy is a mentally damaged criminal.
Trump needs to be committed  he is dangerous to the country  they are going  end up in  riots he is trying to stoke the fire for people to  fight for him trump is corrupt

Not sure who is worse him or his maggots smfh
Looking forward to the day liesalot trump loses ! !
Careful what you ask for Trump!!!
"Foreign Gangs Take Root in America’s Sanctuary Cities. America can no longer ignore the consequences of its failed experiment with sanctuary cities and unchecked illegal immigration. The problem has metastasized beyond our southern border and now threatens communities throughout the nation...
<br>
<br>The latest outrage is happening because of the loud-and-proud sanctuary city of Denver, Colorado, where foreign gangs have found sanctuary alongside the illegal immigrants. Mayor Michael Johnston, the third-worst sanctuary mayor in America, has championed an effort to fund myriad programs for illegal aliens at the expense of police, public parks, and Department of Motor Vehicles budgets, among other legitimate concerns of citizens. As a result, nearly 40,000 aliens have arrived in the Mile High City since December 2022...
<br>
<br>Denver is not the only sanctuary city where Tren de Aragua has set up operations. In New York City, the gang has masterminded a crime ring that steals New Yorkers’ smart phones, uses the financial data on them to plunder victims’ bank accounts, and then sells the phones in South America. The gang has also used the city’s migrant hotels as places to extort money from residents and to recruit new members.
<br>
<br>In sanctuary Chicago, a 911 call has gone viral, detailing a Tren de Aragua takeover of an apartment building by 32 gang members that sounds almost identical to the incident in Aurora. In response, a video posted on X by a Chicago resident suggested that further takeover attempts by Tren de Aragua would be met with violence by homegrown gangs. So, in addition to all the other bad consequences of sanctuary policies, cities like Chicago should now brace for shootouts in the streets between American and foreign gangs. Is this part of how “immigration makes us stronger,” as sanctuary mayors have told us ad nauseam?"
"Democrats allow openly racist remarks such as Letitia saying that Trump is ""too pale"".  So that means Kamala and Biden and Walz are all too pale, as well.
<br>Native Americans wanted a WALL, and they also owned black slaves.
<br>Who should decide which race is the one to determine our standards??????"
"Two illegal immigrants have been indicted for allegedly conspiring to kidnap and ransom other illegals living in Southern California, federal authorities said Monday. The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a statement that Honduran Darwin Jeovany Palma, 30, and fellow national Eduar Isrrael Sauceda Nuñez, 25, allegedly planned to kidnap and ransom immigrants illegally crossing the U.S. – Mexico border.  Migrants were allegedly taken to stash houses in Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico where their cellphones were confiscated, the DOJ said, adding that 57 migrants were held at a stash house in Albuquerque"
A Hugh Blue Tsunami in coming this November General Election.  Trump for Prison 2024.  Lock Him Up.  😹
"So tired of the racist, tropes and false claims of racism from MSNBC pendents and so-called journalist that I would say are better suited for tabloids but that would be an insult the tabloids.  Morning Joe and Mika are partisan hacks lacking any credibility."
Get out and Vote for Democrats up and down the ballot. 💙💙💙💙💙💙
Yet both of them are better than Trump@!
Doesn’t this feel like Germany circa 1933??? 🤔
And the fact that this race is so close goes to show you what kind of lunatics there are in America that support this lunatic
WE thought 'SPANK YOUR CHILD ONCE A DAY...' Bumper Stickers was thing of the Past 🍀🇨🇦⚜️
WE so sorry aboot youz Civil War - such NARCISISTIC NARRATIVE - so so sorry to hear 🍀🇨🇦⚜️
Sick. He is just SICK.
I feel like I lose brain cells listening to him
I need to go on Joe.  I've studied this.  A reference to mental handicap is Hitler speech for euthanasia.  His reference to the fly is a straight out Hitler call to exterminate a race or group.
There is a fly because Trump is possessed and he needs to be exorcised😂 …Everything he said on those speeches are more likely him😂
"It is the Democrat Party who began sending racist e-mails back in 2007 or earlier.  Written by Deepak Chopra saying he hated all small towns in America and all of Alaska.  Oh, really?<br>MINORITIES live in both places.  <br>What a dork!!!!  <br>Democrats allow openly racist remarks such as Letitia saying that Trump is ""too pale"".  So that means Kamala and Biden and Walz are all too pale, as well.<br>Native Americans wanted a WALL, and they also owned black slaves.<br>Who should decide which race is the one to determine our standards??????"
"Vote Blue, save our democracy and freedoms!  Time to erase any memory of Trump and move forward!"
"Magician 's trick, look over there  so you don't see how I'm fooling you with these lies. 😢"
I am just as disturbed by the people clapping & cheering. 😢
"Those maga nutjobs behind him are paid to hold up those banners, how idiotic can they be."
Trump's mind lives in a dungeon.
How did Philadelphia cheat? They have always swung blue 😂
He is the most disrespectful human being ever at nearly 80 years old. May God have mercy on his soul!😢
How is Donald Trump racist by calling somebody stupid lol 😂 MSNBC is only creating victim mentality.
And that is the best the Republican party has to offer.
He is just projecting … it is so obvious! Lol
"Everyone hates you, Trump… except for your ridiculous cult, followers who just haven’t made sense of things yet, but they will"
And cursed with God’s name
…not only took God’s name in vain but lied with God’s name in the same breath
Why does MSNBC keep showing  Trump talking this mess?
Trump is the stupid person.
Good show!
Crowd size and trashing women. He'll say anything to keep the attention away from his tiny... life
The real Racists are MSNBC  🖕
Who really listen to the msnbc. If you only listen to Joe and Mika then you are in your own little world who edit and leave out what Trump is saying in his full speech instead of scheming to undermine America.
"If you pay attention to what makes Trump supporters yell in support of what he is saying, you will always find it is because Trump said something vile."
IT WILL BE SO NICE FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. When this is over. This brings back the divide as of the 1900 to the 60s. Many people lost their lives because the words of others. The problem today is more people won't stand to be abused willing.
Does the 'M' in your name (MSNBC) stand for Marxism?<br>Not even sociologists want Marxism.  <br>And black sociologists do not want illegal immigration.
",,😂😂😂😂"
"President Trump is right in what he said. Its true she wrecked the Border, allowing all those people in to USA. She is mental."
He's talking about his self
"So MSDNC calls someone racist. What else is new? Someone who isn't racist? That would be news, but we know that can't happen, since everything and everyone is already racist according to these chicken littles."
Nothing but bots in this comment section. Whether they are ai or actual people is irrelevant since the effect is the same.
My grandson witnessed Tim Walz flipping off Michigan fans Saturday at the Michigan Minnesota football game who were chanting 'Trump 24 Baby'. Walz is a classless buffoon.
Weird no longer begins to describe it
Long life for Donald Trump❤❤❤❤❤
"Instead of ""sleepy joe"", it should be ""Sleepy Donald"", ""Low Energy Donald"""
Hillary was ahead by 12 points just two weeks before the 2016 election. BIden was up by 7.<br>Harris needs to up her race game.   More race cards Kamala !!
What we have here in America is MAGA REDUMPLICANS VS REPUBLICANS!!! The REPUBLICANS as we know it have been taken over by MAGA REDUMPLICANS!!! I completely applauded the Real Republicans voting for HARRIS/WALZ to stump Trump in Roevember for all rights!!!💙💙💙
You are a flier dude!!
This channel is such trash.
Notice all the cities he says are out of control are cities that have minorities; He's vying for a race war
Panicking and desperation Trump is scared of going to jail.
TRUMP IS CIRCLING THE DRAIN 😂😂😂
That person is so jealous of Harris winning... 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Lies
Watta mental brain dead  this guy totally sick in the brain
"DEPLORABLE: DJT the compulsive liar still got the gullible minions.<br><br>If Dumb Donnie still wins it would be the worst event in US history.<br><br>MAGA means MAMA, Make America MINE again (& be out of jail) 😅"
Say it to her face Don Lol
Hahaha the media is trying everything they can they running scared!
He’s saying dems are cheating .. over and over again he says it. We now know the topic of chaos coming after Election Day .
Nothing like a mentally ill person calling others mentally ill. Look 👀 mentally ill people clapping along. They have no idea what’s coming with him.
That's freedom of speech.  They called Hitler that is worst.
Great I have the bevis and butthead Tokyo rose on my utube feed
Little Don
Those cheating in the elections are shaking..😂😂😂
Everyone on their side because you let your anger get the better side of you
"This election on November, it will be a landslide win by kamala Harris 🎉🎉🎉"
The only one trying to cheat is Donald Trump in the Republican party they're trying to pass laws to cheat right now as we speak and it's not going to happen we will not allow it and Donald Trump will never be in power we will not let him in
I'm a white female and I stand with Springfield against Pig faced dictator Donald Trump. He must be jailed for his crimes as soon as the election is over
He is Garbage appealing to the Garbage.
"TRUMPS ""JEALOUS"" BECAUSE HE KNOWS PUTIN..LIKES KAMALA..BETTER!"
He needs to be gone
"Since the Walz/Vance debate is tonight... I'm wondering if Walz or the moderators will bring up Vance's past (truly damning) comments about trump? I've not seen anyone (media,etc.) ask him to explain his 180 regarding trump!"
Only. People who are. Voteing for. Trump. Are. Racist. Police. Officers. Church people. Racist people
That lunatic is preparing his lunatic supporters to act up when he loses this election. We MUST be ready for it!
"Trump is saying they can’t speak English.  Who in the heck can understand what his wife is saying when she talks, an immigrant."
"Trump is ridiculous. He’s desperate. And when he mention the Bible”, I’m at a loss for words,  he held it upside down because he wasn’t  familiar with it. Vote Blue."
God. Forbid.  Trump.   Wining. !  Trump. Against. The. Jews.  Trump is. Racist. Amen 🙏
Trump sounds like he’s drunk. Not tipsy but just drunk. Scary
Republicans are.  Racist
Trump is a racist and a Dictator
"Surprised he has not grown a little mustache. He's crazy. I believe the only ""people"" who cheated in the last Election, where all attached to the MAGA nut's."
Only a fool would vote for four more years of what we just had. js.
What did she do?
Weeks ago Trump said he wanted the America from 300 years ago and to this day not one news orginasation has commented or denounced it. And now he gets worse and feels majority of white wants the same. Every true American Christian as well as the other dinosaurs ask yourself is that the behaviour Jesús would display. No but it is what Satan has done since God created Man and woman.Think❤😮
Im concern about new supporters for Trump in whole heartly; him: prob your fired within a second! Im a conservative dont appreciate   verbal abuse not ever not now.
Trump has fully lost his mind!😮😮😮😮
Met Gods grace 2x! God giveth god take it away has harden his ❤ even more.😈😈he listens & mixes Rebuke that in Jesus name
"'exhaustion' and 'boredom' of attendees at these rallies, deftly mentioned by Harris in the debate,: observe at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao-Dsq5OJTA&t=233"">3:53</a> mark , with guy in sunglasses resting his head, from having to hear Trump's gibberish ad nauseam"
Imagine if Chump becomes more mentally defiicient or dies in office. JD Vance would be leader of the free world. Truly horrific.
"It's so ironic that Chump projects his lies and cons on what he actually is guilty of. He blames Harris for voter fraud when he is the only past President that denied a fair election, prevented and created chaos to divide people when we have worldwide dysfunction and will surly destroy democracy."
Trump should be in prison
Trump invaded White House where 2 policemen were killed !! That was the most cruel violence against democracy and human rights !!<br>Trump is criminal !!!! Trump is dirty liar !!! Trump is very dangerous man for society !!!!<br><br>Hariss is the most intelligent and honest leader !!! She will America as a great nation and contribute great world peace !!!
I just had to come back over here to this channel just to see for myself that over 50% of the country hates Donald Trump over his ego and don't love him for his peace and prosperity policies 50% of the country at least is supposed to be voting for Kamala Harris Personally as a United States veteran did not think when I wore the uniform of the United States of America that the flag on my arm that's so many through the generations have fought and died over would be hated by its own people nor did I believe that over half of my country was stupid enough or dumb enough or gullible enough to vote for Kamala Harris specially after the last four years but I knew if they existed I would be able to find them in the comments here to those who hate over personality I say do you don't vote vote for Kamala so Trump loses so many people going to let hatred for one man destroy the fabric and foundations of the millions of men and women who died and fought for this country and what that flag truly represents to jeopardize the freedoms that's made America great for so long we've all had our faults our country has had its faults but so is every country that's ever existed on the face of this planet hate all you want but love your families those that are here and those who sacrifice before so you can be where you are today usually I'm aggressive short tempered and have no patience for stupidity it will get you killed maybe just one kid in high school may read this just know the power the Democrats hold is because of their ability to manipulate young minds like you to manipulate the minds of our elderly through lies and deceit through treasonous actions with our enemies the Democrats created racism Democrats created the Ku Klux Klan Jim Crow laws were all passed by Democrats they use social media to distort history and the facts of the current times they project which means publicly they accuse their opponents of what they know they are doing themselves and what they are responsible for they only care about power and so does most rhino Republicans I called them Bush Republicans who only want war power and money that goes along with both Donald Trump is different as his policies are at odds with both sides of the aisle it's why he's hated so bad if Trump is all about his self that should be fine with you he will not allow himself to look bad or to fail he wants to look strong and tough all our qualities we need to never give up on what we believe in America should be strong not made to look bad in this country should never give up on his core principles of the constitution which is kept us on top. If you join the military or serve your country in any capacity officially for the government or through the government you will have to say an oath to that constitution defended against all enemies foreign and domestic my friends the CIA the FBI military intelligence so-called homeland security are compromised by those that I spoke of earlier we must protect the constitution we must be strong and brave the CIA and the FBI are running propaganda operations on Americans on American soil it may be why you think the way you do and why you have come to their channel here to be fed more propaganda get your bellies full digest what I've told you and what comes out is exactly what they're selling you don't have to tell nobody but you can have pride in your country if you're not a strong person mentally or physically it doesn't mean you can be intelligent and make the right decisions so as a United States veteran who serve my country I say to the people of this country to the young in school or just got out in college to those in the nursing home that can still read and see this text don't leave this world worse than it was when you were here it is up to every one of us to do something they divide us with money with race with political parties R's I's or D's we are Americans don't be manipulated and even if you shall be manipulated turn your head hold your nose and push that button for Donald J Trump he has shown he is willing to sacrifice his life for this country what anybody else running in this race do the same give him what he's earned if it's not your respect give him your vote then come back to this stream in four years it will be clear to you that you have been a victim to Propaganda And their deep state operation you will know you've made the right decision your life will be better your families life will be better there is no other alternative on the ballot make the right decision America the world depends on it make us proud to represent the people of this great country God give you wisdom and the strength to do what's right not what you like George Orwell 1982 was his last lecture George called them the police now we call him MSNBC fact checkers we are one team we are one people we are Americans!  🇺🇸🫡
Trump is the the symptom of a brainless and bigoted culture. Neonazis need to be dealt with.
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿for the mind😞
"Trump is like a Halloween pumpkin, orange on the outside, hollow inside, and gets thrown out in November"
And he promised a bloodbath! 😂😂 idiots! 😂
"It's a chore just to listen his annoying voice, never mind the nonsense he's talking."
Americans Witness the Desperate Criminal in Action with Lies and Conspiracy Theories Trump is a lunatic
"If you are a United States citizen and registered voter, l urge you to please PRAY before you vote.<br>Pay attention to the personal revelation you receive.<br>Do not vote based on party lines, rumors, or peer pressure.<br>Think about Christ, and the example which he provided us.<br>We should love our neighbors and help those in need- not judge and condemn. ❤🇺🇸💙<br>I am praying for unity, freedom, and democracy for our nation."
Msnbc is fat phobic
LOL. This comment section😂. Unhinged dems. 2 brain cells shared by hundreds.
He's really describing himself
"He's still p*<b>**</b> about the debate, and he got destroyed on national t v"
Total projection from Don the Con Drumpf...
"I love how he talks about cheating, yet the elector college waves in favour of republicans"
You need to keep GOD OUT OF YOUR EVIL MOUTH
The unfortunate of being gullible
"Jan 6th, Fake electors plot, pressured Mike Pence to certify his FAKE electors, talking about suspending the constitution, tried to hide his connection to Project2025, talks about being a dictator for ""only a day"" or ""only an hour""...etc.<br><br>This man IS in position to be our Hitler.<br>The targets may be different, but the hate, the scapegoating, the lies, and the dictator attempts are in full effect.<br>DON'T be a tool for hate, YOU could be next on the chopping block."
Its time to get Democrats out we cant afford four more years !!!!!!
A NEW DANGEROUS want to be HILTER
He is disgusting…
He's right go trump
"Trump must come to the Power asap !!! Russia & Ukraine war + disputes with China have Decreased the Cash Flow through out the Global & due to sanctions we've literally banned Cheap Resources alternatives from Russia & China & forced to Buy same resource from Remaining Producers with limited resources at 3× & 20× prices. Further, putting Pressure on existing Cash flow. We can't afford the War for too long. 1 missile is costing almost 5 job loss here. Biden isn't telling the world that Whole Aviation industry has stalled as, Russia is key Producer of  Material & alloys required to manufacture engine blades here. This, is something that lucky came on surface we don't know how many industries are struggling from the same problem. Volkswagen is about to bankrupt due to EV and but, what they don't tell is it had to let go it's largest market Russia."
Trump is dramatic but because we don't live in a free country we have choice  A or B hands down I choose Trump
The dude is crazy!
Shut up
We love that man!!!! God bless every Republican in the planet🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
"This clown is all the way CRAZY, but most of all he is dangerous VOTE BLUE"
"D🍊N🤥LD, the card nobody wants to play no more. Escaped from the insane asylum together with all his supporters, now walking freely around in the US. This once Worldpower is heavily rotting from inside…"
"America is being warned by Dr. Bandy Lee's diagnosis of Trump mental incapacity Take Dr. Bandy, seriously. <br><br>One thing I like about Americans is that we do not prevent things from happening, but we like to fix things after the damage is already done. This is the situation with Trump."
America you are the laughing stock of the world
"No political Figure in America, Republican or Democrat, is more ""Mentally Impaired"" than Trump. After crying that America is a Failing Nation, after saying the Economy is in a sad shape, after saying that people cannot afford necessities. Trump comes up with new plan to fleece his supporters: $500 Watches for the poor MAGA, $100,000 Watches for the rich MAGA...!!!...So, the people who are in such a bad shape, should spend their money to buy his Watches...LOL"
Crime is down because what happens inside Trump properties are not being reported.
"Border Czar Kamala Harris  could have closed the border 3.5 years ago.  Harris wants middle class taxpayers to pay for unvetted migrants housing and health carte.  NYC has paid 5.5 billion dollars to migrants and migrant crime is up in NYC.<br><br>Harris lied when she said the border was secure, that bidenomics was working ,that Biden was fit to be president, that Trump will sign an abortion ban and was ordered by a judge to hand over exculpatory evidence to defendants her office prosecuted."
"Kamala sure is remarkably accomplished for one who has been ""mentally impaired since birth"""
TRUMP 2024.
Will America have a purge? Wow 🤯
"Hey people, LEARN how to FLIP the lost souls drinking Trump's Kool-Aid. If you don't know how, contact me to learn."
"i cannot help but wonder how freaked out trump would be if the media did the smart thing in their reporting by:<br>a.  mearly stating, ""trump did another stupid thing today."" and then NOT saying what he did or said,<br>b.  go on to report on something that Kamala or Tim is doing."
MSNBC spreading the democrat progressive liberal woke lies spread all over the place. See you at the polls in November. Can’t wait. TRUMP 2024!!!!!! 🙂👍🙏
Does tomm tim scott agree?
Because Morning Joe fans believe anything....lol
I love the reaction of the people in the back ...They are so concerned of him talking all nonsense
2.45 Because ( I ) wouldn't have to cheat.
It sounds like there are only a couple dozen people in those DT rallies. Sad!
He's totally off his trolley. Anyone who actually possesses the  normal cognitive faculties would discern that this guy is in a severe mental decline. The fly stuff....... hes just WEIRD.
"for someone who claims to be a ""stable genius"" the man is so very WACKO STUPID!!!<br>(and not at all logical!!)"
That a lie!!! Everyone speak English in Ohio my home state!!!
"The ghost help he is bringing to the victims of Helene is a sight to behold,this guy was born lying!!!"
It’s like something compels him to project. He’s literally talking about himself. Oh no another fly 😂😂😂😂
Everything Trump says is projection at its finest. How sad.
Flies? Blame your leaky diaper.
"He has the face of a person that went mad, for real! Something is worse with him lately! More than usual. You can see it in his eyes."
"Trump is out of his mind, plain and simple. Gone round the bend. Crazy train has left the station."
Trump is “Lord of the Flies “
There's no longer any maintaining the fiction that MAGA cultists are misguided dupes. They're just plain evil.
The fly escaped from his diaper!
Only a mentally impaired person would suggest a PURGE OF VIOLENCE. <br>All these states are states that are turning away from him . <br>HE IS A PSYCHOPATH!<br>   Donnie- the fly is around you bc YOU STINK TO MUCH FOR AMERICA.
"God came down from ""a high""        ???"
Attempt a coup and still get to run for president after.
"Every time he opens his fat mouth, he loses votes. Keep up the good work 45, you are such a loser!"
Trump is deplorable.  His words are ugly. KH’s resume is impressive.  Trump is unfit and his toxic rhetoric should be called out by repubs with a backbone
I nominate tRump for the STUPID Award! Are you smarter than a first grader? Geesh!!!
You will lose again  .<br>Only great presidents get  RE-ELECTED
"He is more incontinent now, shuffling around with pounds of make up on will do that."
"He doesn't care anymore, he's a desperate old man saying anything to stay out of prison."
I'm disappointed in American voters... This garbage is only 5% points down! SMDH
My guess is Trump is going to continue to spiral as we get closer to Election Day. Don’t be surprised if more profanity is used by him and more racist language. He’s channeling the worst underbelly of America and let’s pray there’s enough of us that he doesn’t win again.
This man is shameful 😢
Trump - what a piece of work he is! 🤨
tRump wants to lose.
"The bullying, lies, threats and insults are really getting old...."
How low can Trump go? How low can Trump supporters go?😢
Shut him up puhleeeeze! <br>His whole campaign is like a sick manifesto.
It is said that a criminal hides their criminality by putting blame on others.  When does he stop?
Americans are getting sick and tired of the Media calling everything racist
"wanna understand why we choose trump?<br><br>Trump is not lying. Why doesn’t someone tell me why kamel isn’t or hasn’t fixed any of our countries issues? We the people are America, what happened to voting for people who make positive change? Kamel and Biden are the starting point for continuous crime in our country and it’s definitely not a bright looking future with her. If you think they aren’t puppets controlled by the strings of those who see us people as nothing but useless and disgusting, then you haven’t done enough to learn what’s going on.<br><br>If you want to understand why a majority of people support trump it’s not because he’s perfect, it’s because he’s not controlled or influenced by anyone, money, or power. And he’s repeatedly built success from nothing in his business life, and has shown to replicate those skills towards the country when in office. He simply had what it takes to make America great again. I believe he wants to die with that goal being completed with his name behind it, I don’t at all believe he just wants power as an older guy with kids and more money than everyone in this comment section combined."
"I am Vladimir, (not bot) and I generate fair and balanced political commentary:<br><br>Comrade Trump is NOT a RACIALIST!<br>Also, NOT treasonous dog!<br><br>(Repeat, not bot)"
Double down? He quadruple down!!
Outside of lower taxes for people who have more than enough money and violence violence violence. What are his policies? I am genuinely curious?
This comment section is even dumber than the CNN comment section. MSNBC is some piece of work.
"It is absolutely clear that the POS former president has self-destructed, and that he will again lose the presidential election."
"lol, still using the racism word?"
"This man is full of hate and dumb too. Not one rally he talk about economy, infaltion, child care, abortion right, women right vote , tax cut..and what is wrong wiyh his supporters head because they are be brainwash of stupid convicted trump propaganda"
"@Mitch McConnell this is your legacy.  As a life long Republican, I see you destroyed the party by not holding yourself and your party accountable when it would have been trivial.  All you have now is a paerson speaking for you in incoherent (and legally actionable) threats.  The Republican party deserved substantially better from you."
He makes me absolutely nauseous!!!! I can't believe he has followers.
"Donmentia has no business questioning anybody else's intellect. He's clearly a senile, rambling, ranting, raving racist who can't express an intelligent thought."
You can really hear the racism
All Donvict does is spout klannish-Hitleresque rhetoric to his klan member saltine audience.
Not long ago his fans would have been looked on with pity. Now it's with disgust.
"The people cheering on the old man’s middle school-level insults, incredibly repulsive."
"I know these clips have to be shared so we can all see what a fruit cake he is, but I’m so over hearing that voice, sooner he’s locked up the better."
"Well, what's gonna happen.. If Trump lost the next election "".. perhaps he goes to create another January 6 again...* Because he will can not deport the Haitians,. As he promised*.. and vance said he goes to create history and he doesn't like this people.. that's why he married with a white woman. ?"
How can the race be tight. Incredible
Why does the orange orang utan always look like he's melting...
"The ""extraordinary racists are on YOUR network, right Joy Reid????"
"SELLING LIES, HATE, ASSASSINATIONS FOR PROFIT BY MSNBC AND CNN
<br>Experts agree that the near assassination of Former President Donald Trump by troubled and mentally disturbed teenager was caused by the constant irrational attacks on Trump especially constantly referring to him as Hitler. To an irrational mind like the shooter, there is a moral justification to shooting Hitler since Hitler killed 12 million human beings including the gassing of 6 million Jews. The Democratic Convention proved that the Democrats have no policy or position to solving any of the huge problems threatening the survival of today’s America and America’s Middle class and lower class. The only platform they are running on is hating Donald Trump and mentioned his name over 300 times on just the first night- again calling him Hitler and a threat to American democracy. MSNBC is not about Journalism but is a leftist organization that  leads the nation in promoting lies and hate speech and simply parroting  the daily scripts given to them by the Democrats and the deep state. MSNBC is owned by NBCUniversal whose CEO is a person named Michael Cavanagh. NBCUniversal is owned by Comcast whose CEO is Brian L. Roberts. The question is why Cavanagh and Roberts allow MSNBC to continue spewing this hate and divisiveness that twice almost killed Donald Trump? Trump is a compassionate man with a loving wife and wonderful children and grandchildren whose lives would be severely impacted by his death. The answer could possibly be that Roberts and Cavanagh put money and profits ahead of morality and are selling lies and hate for profit. How can they live with themselves? Is this the example they are proud to show to their families and friends? Is there any decency left in corporate America? Do they send their children to schools that  put Tampons in boy’s bathrooms as signed into law by the  democratic nominee for Vice President who makes fun of people like JD Vance who went to Yale University -a condemnation of Yale graduates which is repeated frequently on MSNBC. Is Yale university happy with this? Does Cavanagh’s and Robert’s salary and stock options, if any, derived from MSNBC’s constant lies and hate speech that almost resulted in the death of Donald Trump ? These are questions that should be answered regarding the management of MSNBC and Comcast. In my case I would advise parents not to send their children or contribute to Yale University, not to watch MSNBC or NBC and do business with any company owned by Comcast. MSNBC and CNN are failing as Americans wake up to their lies Cavanaugh and Roberts should be brought before congress to testify under oath why MSNBC is ignoring traditional and investigating journalism and just parroting daily talking points given to them by the democratic party and the deep state in order to create havoc, divisiveness and attempted assassinations. Shame on them."
He is slurring and having a meltdown
"Everyone knows that Donvict is a racist pathological liar. The problem is <i>most of the mainstream media.</i> They need to stop sane-washing Donvict's vile, racist, inflammatory rhetoric about immigrants. Most of all, the media needs to start calling his language racist. 😡"
What a disgusting racist 😡
Wow... is that your go to word? 😂😂😂  you sound like whiny middle school girls.
"Yes, please, mainstream media. Keep campaigning for America's Favorite Wine Mom and taking <br>edited video snippets  with usual sheep screams of ""Raaaaay Cisss Emmmmm ""  ! <br><br>These two combed and blow dried talking heads make me sick. <br><br>Trump/Vance 2024 !"
Who thinks this thing can run Our country when he doesn't have a coherent thought in his head? The media needs to stop treatingwhat he says as normal.  Call him out as nonfunctional.  His speeches are bs.  He makes no sense.  Get rid of him.
"So many Destroyers, so little time lol.  Keep keeping it real Ohn!"
Please lock him up after he loses lol
Ya are bunch of liars trump is going to win
Ya are bunch of liars trump is going to win
"Common sense should prevail but many cheer and think Orangina's behavior is just fine. Apparently they need to be told daily that his behavior is NOT functional, normal, rational or ""Presidential"". <br><br>There's a cult phenomenon that renders pointing this out even repeatedly unsuccessful. Still, the newscasters should continue to try. Not trying just normalizes Orangina's appalling behavior and obvious inability to serve. <br><br>This Independent will Vote Blue! For us and for those who don't know what they're supporting. 💙"
"When the Left has no argument , no policy, and after 4 years in office no results, you can always depend upon them to play the race card."
"He's deranged and intentionally hurts people.  The people clapping and cheering are already suffering the choices they are making in their lives.  The ""libs"" aren't their problem.  They are."
TRUMP/VANCE 2024 !!!!!
"GOP, REPUBLICAN PARTY, Donald Trump BROKE IT and now YOU OWN IT!!!!"
Kamala makes racist remarks about Trump! You need to stop calling out Trump when Kamala does her own race thing!!
"Harris always promoted she was Indian left & right in California.<br>Now that she is running for President, ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE IS BLACK!<br>Yeah, shes a racist"
"Kamala is mentally impaired, yet why is Chump still hesitant to debate her? During their last debate, Chump didn't even glance at her once."
Why is our country allowing trump to spew insults and dangerous rhetoric??? Wow !! He divides this country and the republicans continue to support him
He said he wants to militarize police. Are MAGATS So ignorant they think that WONT affect them?
He's not a bright guy
Yeah 2 years ago Grandpa Trump wasn't crapping his pants which now attracts the flies.
"As always, Chump, you're being a coward. You talk a big game behind her back, but when it comes to confronting her in person, you can't even look her in the eye."
"tRUMP is terrified of strong women, so his defense against them is to try and demean them.  He’s furious that Kamala was thoroughly prepared and she mopped the floor with him during the debate…she humiliated him and cut him off at the knees….so this is his way of retaliating….like some kind of a spoiled rotten little kid.  He’s no longer interested in winning the election…he just wants to get his posse all riled up so they’ll unleash a bunch of violence on his behalf. He’s a pathetic and pitiful excuse for a man.  How anyone could’ve ever thought it was a good idea for him to be the President of the USA is beyond my comprehension!"
Les démocrates ont laise tombe
What is the dislike count on this video?
With that purple hair he looks like the clown that he is.
TRUMP 2024
Poor thing that debate about to send him straight to a nursing home he's GONE GONE..  We all see it unfolding
"What is the ""thing"" she did that would get a republican impeached?  I'm confused...."

You lost!!!<br>dana t.
During this election I made a firm decision to NEVER VOTE FOR ANY REPUBLICAN PARTY MEMBER in any kind of election. Their policy is lying and cheating.
"""If God came down from high"".... There would be no MAGA people left...."
You idiotic commentators - why are you playing his stupid comments.
Who is calling the kettle black??!!
He doesn’t care about disabled people and this shows it.
REGISTER TO VOTE!!! ESPECIALLY IN SWING STATES AND VOTE BLUE. VOTE HARRIS/WALZ 2024!!!!! 🇺🇲
"Evil has reared its ugly head in America. The world will suffer if this monster is re elected, because he has a debt to settle. He is a bitter and sick man, out for Blood."
None of those Republican men or Republican women would dare say it to Trumps face. They know they will get their azz tore up by Trump.
Talking about crime and corruption is racist?
BC he knows his base is racist.
"He just wants to play games with you, he wants to talk about him"
"He's talking about himself,  right ? 🤫 and in regards to cheating,  he's  GUILTY as charged !"
Trump has flies favorite food in his diaper...that's why...hahaha
He sees the writing on the wall and he’s desperate.
Trump 2024
Where are you clowns fleeing to in November?
Peope should remember trump is the third generation  From Germany.. <br>And should not expect anything else or better..
I agree democrats should take a voting test
"I don't know if there is any black person in Their right mind or if having anything about themselves would support racists, norcissist old man ? <br>I can't wait for the election to be over and he lost this election.. <br>I am tired of hearing his voice and seeing him on my television.."
"It's funny, I never hear them say anything negative about Kamala Harris."
Dude needs serious psychiatric intervention.  And an exorcism.
"""If god came down from a high...😂"
"What's actually really stupid about the whole one day of violence is that if you tell everybody it's only going to last <i>one</i> day, what's stopping the ""criminals"" from just taking a day off and hitting the streets the next day?"
The result of a drowning person without a life preserver.
All he do is throw insults. So childish! Is this what we want to be president? NO!!!
Im looking at this Senile Billionaire and thinking... Imagine if any other Former U.S President like  President Obama got on the United States Presidential Podium and said HALF the things this lunatic says AND be able to get away with it. Like honestly. Can you imagine? Because i Cannot 😵‍💫🫣😳🤯
The worst thing is that everyone cheers for him and themselves are horrible people too
There is something wrong with Kamala? There is a lot wrong with you Sir!
"Did I miss something here?  Every white person in the US is an immigrant, and not very nice immigrants, if you check history."
LIARS FOR KAMALA HARRIS
"I love how they have to connect the dots to how something is racist....if its soooo high altitude racism that it takes two white eggheads with himmler and tojo glasses to decipher, then why is everybody worried about stupid Trump supporters? I was expecting a black joke, this was neurosurgery meets monty python and if either one of these bald mofos has a pitbull skull shaver, they should be immediately cancelled because the guy that sells them on the commercials makes fun of foreigners with bad accents....which is funny, meaning its probably also racist."
Im hispanic and Donald Trump is right!  Close the borders!! WHY HAVENT SHE!!??? He is not racist. He is on point!!!
If anybody else spoke like this in public they'd be having a. 72 hour involuntarily mental health evaluation at the local hospital. Followed by a long term stay there & some <b>SERIOUS</b> amounts of medication.
The Purge is the wrong reference. Trump was calling for an American Kristallnacht. He is calling for police and paramilitary thugs to target immigrants and his political opponents.
"I like Hogan but Maryland needs that Senate seat or Dems lose their majority. Hogan needs to lose, because at the end of the day, he’s still a Republican."
People and believe in Donald Trump watch the news
"Tom Emmer, is a clown,  he can joinn Trump in Prision. for what he is doing"
"Poor Donnie he is scared of a fly,  you poor boy, Donnie"
"And when you think about it Donnie, everybody knows threre is something missing.  YOUR BRAIN.  Yes we will prosucte the people that cheated in the last election.  10 to 20 yrs in prision for you Donnie"
Lindsey Graham the comedian
"LOL.  MSNBC calling Trump out for him saying Harris is stupid.  Being called stupid is NOTHING compared to MSNBC calling Trump a racist, fascist, dictator, Hitler, bla bla bla.  Save your croc tears MSNBC, Harris IS stupid relatively speaking.  She doesn't have the experience, the maturity, or the intelligence to lead a country.  And more shocking and the bigger story should be the port workers about to go on strike and Biden has proclaimed ""hands off"".  What would Harris say or do?  Answer:  What ever is in the worst interest of the American people.  Facts are facts, but when you have MSNBC et al making excuses for them, facts are no longer facts, they're propaganda."
What does that have to do with the state of the country?  Trump has been called worse.
"I am voting for Trump and I actually disagree with him on this.  She's not mentally impaired, and there's nothing wrong with her brain.  She's just let evil take over her soul."
donOld tRump is troubled
It’s just so sick that all these sycophants clap for this filth and nonsense. Cult. Pure and simple.
"He wants to scare people into abandoning Harris, he is trying to use a fear mongering wedge to divide people into supporters and non and stir up chaos. He is a very, very dangerous human being because he lacks any empathy. He only cares about himself and winning. That's it. Very sad."
He is getting desperate
"The fly is headed towards the stuff coming out his mouth. This is the new GOP, better known now as the delusion, racist, MAGA crew."
We need to vote and make sure this animal does not win. He will destroy this country.
"Trump is now publicly saying the we need a day or two of ""marshal law"" in the USA....... evidently to make trump a dictator.....This is what the GOP has become..... the extreme far right wing trump for dictator party."
There are no words!!🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈 !!! How someone who speaks like him  could be elevated to the highest government position in the land is as inexplicable as the formation of the universe.
Two rich white folks calling another one racist?
36 days and then TRUTH !
"I don't think the media caught what Trump was saying about the fly, but his supporters did. He was suggesting that the influx of immigrants was responsible. He was comparing them to garbage."
What the heck is this man talking about!!?? It seems like he's got to make Harris out to be a babbling mentally disabled person just to make himself look smart? It doesn't work. It makes him look like a bigger ignorant man than Harris being disabled. She's a highly intelligent woman who will always mop the floor with trump
Mertz Extensions
Calling a woman stupid is nothing new to Trump .He’s the P Diddy of maga republicans the more he screws them the more they like it.Hitler is alive and well.
A mad man talking crazies 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Trump campaigns using hatred and lies. Typical Trump propaganda. He also blames others for everything. Remember his grandfather was once an immigrant. Funny how that goes.
sad sad
Ok hitler.
"And yet, his crowds still applaud him. Is there any sign at all that his apparent mental breakdown is undermining his support? He once said that he could shoot someone in the middle of the street. Maybe he was right.<br>For the record, as a life long resident of Atlanta, I can report that it is a peaceful fully functioning city that is not ""falling apart."""
Trump for president!!!!
"Watching on from Europe, it's extremely disturbing to witness the actual level of support for this hateful, self serving, power hungry bigot. The world knows Trump, we expect the vile hatred he spews daily, but to see that seemingly half the nation truly support him is just so shocking. When they hear the absolute hate, lies & divisiveness from him & they sit & cheer him on?? They're not cheering on his policies, they're cheering on his hate. Its disturbing & extremely worrying. Trump can be voted out, but all his hate filled followers will still be there baying for blood. What then?"
these two talking heads said biden is sharp as a tack and is the best version of him. why do ppl this watch this crap
"That we have to/choose to devote so much time, attention, energy to this unending stream of toxicity... is disturbing. We're in a double bind: because if we don't --? It might be far worse... On the other hand, we keep feeding his insatiable ego and humanity's addiction to Drama."
That's right<br>Keep trump alive<br>Keep trump in the daily news <br><br>The american media is responsible for creating this despicable character
"man, oh man, he is deranged."
Who are the people Trump believes are ready to do violence for him? Shouldn't we know?
I have to agree he should have used not competent. I believe calling him a racist is pretty nsultimg too. He has<br>Cheating in elections should be a crime I agree.<br>When crine is so bad a hard hand is needed this is how it works.<br>Illegal migrants should not be welcomed...do you think borders are there for maps. <br>I'm not 100% white but going on and on and on about race is racist in my opinion.<br><br>Btw talking about Haitian migtants is racist? Talking about Venezuelan gamgs that ate illegal migrants is racist? <br>You guys have no idea what these gangs can do. Cut your throat yeah easily. They shot people in the head for shoes ..
So Biden supports the collective bargaining in Yemen? Sharp as a tack alright.
Thank you for exposing this madman nt able to lose a debate. What will he do to us as President? The harm will also be to the people laughing at his talk of violence. Now he is threatening violence to the decent people.
It’s beyond crazy how this guy still has support
Why can't he pronounce her name correctly? You don't place stress on the second syllable. Simple.
"Trump is weird, he is an insurrectionist, not a candidate"
There is something wrong with Trump and apparently some Americans.  Don't let him cheat and bully himself into the Whitehouse again.  You will never get him out.
"Harris is NOT mentally impaired. She did NO high crimes. There's nothing ""missing."" Certainly not ""stupid."" We DO know that Trump cheated and lied on the last elections. Trump is S---. What does he mean by ""one rough hour?"" That sounds illegal. Also, new immigrants must learn English in school. So what. They learn."
Scarry... He is such a nazy!!!
I'm starting to think Trump is campaigning for Kamala.
This guy is a embarrassment to the US! Enough is enough!
So what else is new. Vote Blue.
Trump belongs in prison
👉  Do not allow your children to watch or listen to Trump. His racist behavior and language can harm your children.
"Narcissists DEFLECT. He can’t face that he is mentally impaired, stup!d, and a cheater and so he calls his opponent those names instead. This is psychology 101"
"If suggesting an open police rampage on US citizens isn't disqualifying for the office, I don't know what is.  Once again his cohorts are lying and saying he was saying this in jest."
Do you guys actually follow and believe what these new channel talking heads are telling us?
"The Purge is suppose to be a horror movie, not a Republican talking point."
Haitians speak English
I don't see or hear Trump doing this. MSNBC are liars!
"The stupid Republican Party, are stupid enough, to allow stupid, anywhere near them, again,  serves themselves right.."
I've said it time and time again trump is a totally classless individual.
"Cong. Emmer thinks that Trump should stick to ""Issues""?  There are three reasons he doesn't.  <br>1.  He doesn't actually know anything about ""the issues,"" except those that might pertain to him personally, like tax cuts for the rich.  Otherwise, he wouldn't talk about anything but very targeted tariffs, not slapping them on all imports.<br>2.  He's too lazy to care or find out about the issues, so when he came up with the idea of what to do when he is miffed about the leader of another country (everything is personal to Trump), he's just looking for a simple way to punish that leader.  You can bet there will be exemptions for imports from Hungary and Turkey, for example.<br>3.  Since Emmer is helping Vance prepare for the debate and Buttigieg is helping Walz, how about the two of them have a debate too?  Emmer, and every Republican, knows that they cannot win on the issues.  When you leave out the racism and authoritarianism, Republicans know that they are one-trick ponies, and that, flawed as they might be, Democratic programs and proposals are popular, and theirs aren't, i.e. Republicans, since 1932, have almost never been able to win in Congress on the issues.  When Republicans did win on ""trickle-down economics,"" how many voters actually believed that rich people would use the windfall they received from Republican tax cuts to benefit workers as much as themselves, and how many voted Republican just to change, to anything else, from Democrats?<br><br>These are the reasons Trump makes completely vague statements about ""the issues"" using the adjectives of a six-year old ( <i>great, terrible, wonderful, fantastic, awful, horrible</i> ) instead of giving the voters details.  So, according to him, crime will disappear if we just allow the police to ""get tough"" for one day, for one hour, and act like thugs, mob enforcers, instead of encouraging them to be positive role models for our children.  Respecting respectable police officers is not necessary.  Only fearing them is.<br><br>That's life in an authoritarian state with one ethnic or religious group dominating another and finding brutal ways to keep them in their place.  It's not like this is an original idea with Trump."
Make AMERICA affordable again! Under trump Poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans reached record lows.<br>		The bottom 50 percent of American households saw a 40 percent increase in net worth.<br>		Wages rose fastest for low-income and blue collar workers – a 16 percent pay increase.<br>		African American homeownership increased from 41.7 percent to 46.4 percent.
Msnbc talking about reporting bias is RICH
"No, the Haitians, in Springfield Ohio, speak two languages, dumpy, they speak French and English."
"The only one caught cheating was you, fake electors, January 6th!"
What a strange couple.....Liberals are SO creepy!!
I will be Voting Blue down the Ballot here 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Won’t be long before he declares that anyone who votes for Kamala Harris is a traitor and must be prosecuted.
"RUN from trump cult supporters. They are the  EXCRUCIATINGLY IGNORANT people; the ones he laughs at in safety behind closed doors at his Mar A Lago club, because he knows they can NEVER AFFORD to enter his club. He'd NEVER allow it. It's why he preaches tax breaks for the rich instead of the rest of us. He wants ONLY THEIR VOTE; NO OTHER ASSOCIATION WITH THEM."
MSNBC can you focus on Trump Russia collusion and what about the dossier?
"It's scary that he's already laying the groundwork for another January 6.  On one hand, I think maybe some of his followers won't be dumb enough to do it again, and risk losing years of their lives in prison for a man who could care less about them, but on the other hand I think maybe they will just know how to do it more effectively this time? For the sake of the country, hopefully it's the former, but I'm not getting my hopes up"
"I would put all of my money on the fact this country would be better and less divisive without Donald Trump. I have zero doubt once Donald Trump is no longer in every single headline of every single mainstream media news outlet, and YouTube video title we the people will finally be able to put down our phones and care less about attacking one another and more about living our lives the way we did before and the way we will when he’s finally gone. End MAGA now.."
Every time Harris opens her mouth she proves just how stupid she really is!
"This man has overstepped the mark, and he is now nothing more than a raving racist who can never be allowed in the President's Office.  He can save his many lies to amuse his fellow inmates with until his dying days.  It is an utter disgrace that he has been allowed to get as far as he has got. The crowds who cheer at his vile comments should be utterly ashamed of themselves for so doing."
This cant be top news of the day
"Fake news to the rescue. You claim racism, the. Show a bunch of clips out of context. None being racist. You are not trust worthy."
Current administration sent more money overseas than they did to help hurricane victims.  <br>LGBT for president trump
Such a pos...LYING LIAR
"""They're letting the flies in! It's out of control, flies everywhere!  Emptying fly prisons, bringing them in from all over the world!  Have you seen these flies?!  They're as big as birds!  It's like the movie 'The Birds', but flies! The biggest, worst flies you've ever seen!  They're eating people's gardens, eating people's pets, they're eating the people!  The flies are eating the people!"""
Trump is projecting again!
Did he just suggest a one hour purge? Good god.
"Trump is a coward from way back, the coward who lied to avoid military service to his country, the coward who refused to fight the real communists in Vietnam, the coward who denied that he lost the election and started an insurrection at the capital in 2020. Trump is a coward, that’s all he is!"
"All these headlines should read:  ""Dump says something stupid again to get people talking about him."""
Disgusting the people cheering for him.
He is a sick old man.
Somebody change his diaper only crap is coming out of his piehole
"they applaud, but then complain about name calling --"
Trump should be arrested and jailed ....
"There's a common notion that everything Trump says is either projection or confession. ""Mentally unstable, a stupid person, cheating in elections, should be prosecuted"" Ya that makes sense!"
Trump is only the face of a bigger problem in America. The fact that a little less than half of our electorate thinks that he’s the better option for president. Our country would have to be shaken to the core in order to fix that problem.
"""I wonder where the fly came from?"" - It came from his dirty diaper."
How can anyone like him be running for president of the U.S.?
"The people who laught at, applaud and support Trumps ignorance are worst than he is."
"So basically Trump just said in his own way that the black people in Detroit , Atlanta and Philadelphia always cheat .."
"He repeats the same negative, racist, and hateful things in every speech because he hopes you will eventually believe his words. If he wins this election and you aren't a billionaire, he will turn on you. Vote with the mindset that your life is at stake, which it is."
Fake news media
he talks like a special needs child.
He’s an odd one to call someone else mentally disabled.
"MSNBC - Stop giving him a platform to spew lies !!!!!!!!! Ok.. state what he said, but stop putting that hateful, dangerous man's videos on your network!! YOU KNOW HE DEFLECTS - Over & over again. Who has personality mental disorders?  Trump. Who cheats before, during & after elections? Trump. Who lies uncontrollably, pathologically? Trump Who creates havoc, hatred, divide & is a warmonger? Trump. <br><br>He spews what HE is. <br><br>Please get that old criminal off your airways before he causes the true mentally (like him) to target Vice president Harris. Our country needs her SAFE"
Are Americans sure that thrump is not demented?
"Kamala is an admitted marxist that has the ethos to destroy the American capitalist economy. Wake up, America. She must be fired!"
Insane asylum is next for the orange clown.
"Those people are there because Trump validates the bigotry, malice and vilness that lurks in their souls, Trump has liberated them to be without restrictions  what they really are"
Trump is clearly stressed and like most narcissist when they are exposed it's not going to end well. Trump would love civil war if he doesn't get what he wants.
Su nariz es más grande que Pinocho y su lengua más grande también racista
This is why they don't history in our schools. GOP is writing their history.
Kamala makes George W. look like a genius
Calling out incompetence doesn't equate to racism!
It is like picking through a huge garbage bin of the most vile rubbish .. never ending and futile.
Trump is the one that's mentally impaired ! He has no respect and no decency !!!! He's one of the stupidest man Iv'e ever seen ! Trump should be arrested and jailed ! PERIOD !
"Harris the border zar, what a joke. Couldn't even do her one job as vice president.the only way any illegals like is because she don't care about the United States or the law.all she's good at is laughing"
I wonder how many people in the crowd only possess a GED or high school diploma? This is just getting ridiculous
"People at his rallies sit there and don't pay attention until Trump says something insulting or nasty- then they cheer. That's what they are there for. Remember, THEY ARE THE PARTY OF FAMILY VALUES."
Sickening
MSNBC why no coverage on the huge numbers of missing children that entered the United States without relatives or parents that are now lost- or missing? No pictures?
I agree...MIGRANTS have more right to American soil then people born in USA.  Cede power and opportunities to all newcomers.  Commie'ala says that we deserve opportunity economy....SHE MEANS OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOREIGN BORN PEOPLE.
All nonsense only going to get some people killed how can people believe in that
Sounds like he's planning a second Kristallnacht.
"Why in 2020 when he was a president, he did nothing about preventing ""unfair election""? Why if it were unfair, he would run anyway and up to now? BECAUSE IT IS NOT UNFAIR AT ALL. He just has a big mouth. He is an excellent example of a sore loser!!!"
"I want him to be president but the insulting has to stop, it’s not helping his campaign"
He is mentally unhinged.  I just don't understand how anyone with any common sense could possibly back him.
"Until now, he just does not have the mental capacity or ability to learn how to pronounce Kamala properly… All the ranting and lying is a disgrace.. By the way Trump, can you speak the language of the native Americans who lived in the country long before you and your family arrived?"
He is totally NUTS lock him up!!!!!
How disgusting can an individual be? Makes fun of people who suffer from some form of a disabilities.
<b>**so we know hes going to have a problem with these states:Detroit=Michigan Philadelphia =Pennsylvania Atlanta+Georgia Thats the groundwork he's laying so no one wonders what the problem is when he has it so here's the prediction **</b>
Donald Shortdick Trump
"I will never forgive or forget those who helped this clown take a second stab at staining America. Not really cool with those who bought into his first run either, but many came to their senses."
the greatest projection of all time!!!
Someone please cap this pos trump
I didn’t hear anything racist in this short clip.
They always catch the craziest pictures
A cheater calling others cheaters
"Lets see, you guys said Biden wasn't impaired, you hide that, and most people don't just watch this news and see for themselves. And worse things were said about Trump by the Democrats. We now found she lied by investigating her birth records. The black grandmother she claimed in a photo with her must have been the help. Then her middle class childhood home is now valued at 18 million."
Clearly shows who is in mental health crisis a pure lunatic
"The fly knows Art history. <br>Trump knows what the fly's presence means. <br>We may not have even noticed the fly. <br>But he is thinking so much about the fly, his words in his own head are so loud, he must speak like a predatory stranger you meet who says ""Don't worry, you can trust me."" <br>When he spoke recently to ""All women"" saying ""I will protect you,"" he was showing you that he is a predator trying to talk you out of your own intuition about him. <br>He had to say it. <br>Because he was thinking of the harm he will do. <br>And the evil voices are so loud in his own head.<br>Reference: <br>The Gift of Fear <br>by Gavin de Becker"
Mentally impaired?  A stupid person?Hey stumpy she's better educated than you.  <br><br>Madam VP Harris needs to sue him and the GOP for defimation of character.
It'll get worse as he begins to realise he's going to lose.  Scary part?  I believe between now and Jan 6th there will be violence.
"Trump is a Con man he is full of BS and does not know how to tell the truth. And regarding the economy and the check that he send out another con he put his name on it and the people think he send it personally it, it was Congress that passed it by the people. He inherited a good economy and when he left it was a total mess."
Kamala is so mentally impaired but she can tell who are Americas friends & who are its enemies.
Donald J. Trump should be very careful of what lies he is saying because he is the biggest cheater of all time and if God did come down to referry this election then the first thing that would happen is a lightning bolt striking the liar Donald J. Trump to ashes for his sins!!!😎🤓🥸🤠👨‍🎓👩‍🎓
Quit stop <br><br>Quit w the bias and conclusions. <br><br>Run the clips and let us decide. We can think. Stop telling us what to think. <br><br>And this from one who opposes Trump
"""Rome is the mob. Conjure magic for them and they'll be distracted. Take away their freedom and still they'll roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the senate, it's the sand of the coliseum.""  Trump won't be around much longer.  But MAGA will.  The hatred, xenophobia, racism, bigotry and misogyny lives on.  And lives on in our neighborhoods, our schools, our government, and for many of us, in our own families."
"Wow just a Trump feast and nothing about Biden and Harris doing anything about the Hurricaine. Who cares what Trump says, their actions show that they don't care about Americans."
Joe knows how to blow
This man IS INSANE. He speaks nothing about POLICIES.
"Trump is a master “projectionist”…that’s right, keep calling her names, saying she’s stupid, she’s a facist, etc. Let’s see what happens after the  election."
Donald Trump is probably the worst human being on the planet right now.
"Does America really want someone as vile as this running their Government?   Thought the whole idea of a democratically elected Head of State was to have some one Of the People, Voted in by the People and working for and on behalf of the People."
Scary thought that these are swing state voters.
Harris is Indian
"If what the criminal con man Donald J. Trump is saying was true about Republicans then he would be doing life in prison.This Fascist lying Nazri is the worst criminal in politics today, lets stand up to this lying fraudster Donald J. Trump by voting for Harris and Walz in November 2024!!!😎🤓🥸🤠👨‍🎓👩‍🎓"
calling for kristallnacht
They talk like they don't insult and smear people all the time.
"When Kamala announced her candidacy, I guessed she would get 65% of the popular vote. Let's wait and see how close I am."
"Trump has learned from the mistakes of Jim Jones.<br>America is in dire straights, listen to the cultists cheering and applauding this despot."
Bizarre !!
"As a disabled veteran, he insults me in ALL ways."
Man i can hardly wait to see the last of this guy.
The moment Trumps Invisible Piano Accordion comes out<br><br>….you know Trump is lying.
He's got the weird hair....He's only missing the stupid little moustache.
What a child
Trump=Hitler
I absolutely HATE Donald Trump!  What a horrible person!  He’s the worst!
Certifiably insane
Talk about mentally deficient. Trump is the new definition.
Trump for blacks 2024🎉
"Just by understanding 1 Corinthians 5:11verse alone,  Not even a single person 🧍🏾 in the entire world 🌎 should ever listen 👂 to a very dishonest person, trump. A con man with delusional disorder."
As usual he is PROJECTING his own stupidity on others... We know that... Everyone knows that---as he would say it himself...
That fly 🪰is buzzing around him because it smells a big blob of 💩. Flys like 💩🤷🏾‍♂️.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao-Dsq5OJTA&t=420"">7:00</a> This is why I like the Lincoln Project,  you can't credit any statement made by Trump as being intelligent."
It’s KAMala. Is he too rude or just too stupid to learn that?
Way too much footage of DJT at once (he's just painful) but THANKS for a good analysis.
Vote him out for good. Save the country Vote Blue 💙 🇺🇸
Absolutely everything Trump says as a claim against Dems is what he is doing himself.   The guy is crazy nuts and not worth one vote let alone millions.
"""hey trump , instant kamala's gonna get you"""
What we need is less coverage of the crazy person and MORE SOLUTIONS CONCERNING HOW TO STOP THIS.  DO NOT KEEP REPEATING HIS RHETORIC WITH NO COMMENTARY ON HOW FASCIST IT IS.
Ttump talks about himself as always. He lost the debate to a mentally disabled person 😂😂
TRUMP IS THE MOST RACIST PRESIDENT IN MODERN DAY AMERICAN HISTORY
"It's actually pretty funny to watch Trump act like a raging lunatic, using rudimentary personal attacks against his political opponent. He thinks because he gets so triggered when people make fun of him, that everyone goes off the deep end like he does. He tried to do it in the debate and she laughed in his face. It's been like 3 weeks and he still can't stop talking about it. He's nearly 80 years old and he's still using insults that kids use against each other on the playground."
Trump equals jail time
There are the most despicable vile words. Until tomorrow when he says even worse things. 💙💙💙💙💙
Trump is trying to get his base to act out in violence!!!!
The said thing about that is those who need to listen is not listening
Is trump trying not to win?
You tried to cheat but you were denied!<br>Revisionist history!
"Trump survived 2 assassination attempts within a month by a non black,Haitian or Latin individual nore were they immigrants and still spews racist hateful violent redderct to those communities everyday"
"So disapointing from trump when you think of the great Presidents of the past, the great leaders.Harris is closer than trump by a mile on Leadership."
"Trump is so scared of Kamala Harris. He's like a 5th grade bully, calling her names when she's not around. And his crowd is like 5th graders egging him on with their applause. How old is he? Who sounds mentally incompetent now?"
No wonder this guy keeps getting shot at . 😢 the bots are crazy
"We know trumps going to be the worst possible president, he’s going to promote extremism, nationalism and corruption again. Some people think he’ll be best for the economy so please speak truth in public forums, donate and vote and help your friends and family vote. This election will impact our lives and lives around the world for a long time to come"
This is such a truely DISPICABLE man
KAMALA HARRIS SAID FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO SAY IT TO HER FACE. AND HE DID! HE CALLED HER A MARXIST TO HER FACE AT 1ST DEBATE. HILARIOUS!
"A viral photo from the Michigan vs. Minnesota college football game shows Minnesota Governor ""Tampon Tim"" Walz giving the middle finger to the crowd after a fans shouted ""Trump for 2024."""
“If God came down from a high…” 😅
😢president trump in georgia help out with supplies a talking to agenties musk. Is helping out wheres biden and harris.long shoremen strick looming wheres biden and harris
"Yeah, we’re going to prosecute. If people try to interfere with election maybe you should think about that Trump you and your little Megas who are already trying to take away peoples votes in certain states maybe you should think about that you’re already out for prosecution for the last election And keep going away you’re going you’re gonna be up for prosecution again for this election and nothing is going to save you from that because you were not president this time so there are no laws to protect you.. you’re a weirdo you’re old and decrepit and frankly senile"
Sick. Disgusting!
"These are outright threats!  Why does Trump get away with this.  Any other person who vows to seek retribution, pain, and death on others would be silenced.  It is at least slanderous.  Why does he get away with it???  Anyone who attends his rallies and applauds his slanderous lies is guilty of the same lies."
Give it to him back to back Kamala  . Don't let him intimidate you. Iron sharpeneth Iron. Send grandpa back to Florida
"Please, the trace not out of control. I’m from Detroit. Our city is doing actually quite awesome. We are a bunch of friendly people are crime is down and one of the most visited cities in the country right now and he thinks for one minute he’s gonna cause chaos in Detroit, we will press charges against him for it so advance. Be careful what kind of lies they put out in the public because Detroit Michigan will prosecute you. You’re not gonna do Detroit Springfield Ohio especially somebody convicted of 34 felons and sexually assaulted a woman gonna sit there and say Detroit is a bad place because it’s far from your lies are bad your lies harm and frankly what you say about Harris that’s more you that it is Harris that’s how you act that’s how you behave your radical. Your words are dangerous and you should never be near the White House or any nuclear codes…"
T-rump definitely fits the title-- WEIRD.....this guy is just WEIRD!!!....sick! sick! sick!
Omg how can no one see what I see DICTATOR.  <br><br>Is this a 15 year old speaking?????
The Republicans are cowerds
HE STILL HAS HIS OVERSEERS BL FOR CHUMP..
"DonOLD who married TWO immigrants who gave him 4 anchor babies.  Trump supporters wearing the red hats, some with their I.Q. on them."
"Any place where Trump is not leading in the polls is out of control. No, sir, you are out of control. Wake up, America!"
"I can’t understand how these trump supporters sit, listen, and cheer trump who is a well-known racist and his racism is clearly shown in everything trump says and does.  I can’t believe his majority white audience does not understand or see that trump is preaching nothing but pure hate, revenge, social unrest and division, yet the crowd just eats it up."
"There's something wrong with Trump. I don't know what it is, but everyone knows it."
"2016 he outted the phoney televangelist, Now he's outting the Real Racist. I'd rather know who they are than not know."
"Boy, those Christian values sure do pour off him, don't they!"
He is so foul. Aren’t yall tired of hearing his disrespect. Just hate and racism.
Cocaine is a helluva drug!!
Maybe you guys in America should invest in education... this orange guy is completley crazy and the half of your population is clapping for him..... 😱 Please vote him to the trash of history. It´s about time!
"Trump is the ‘King of Insults’. We wait in much anticipation, for him to be humiliated via a democratic process … the ballot box."
He screems her name out in the middle of the night she 😊kicked his A-- so bad .
"You know, it is a shame that people cheer and applaud for him when he says these horrible  thing."
Where is the piece of s*** vice president during the hurricanes?
he's OUT OF CONTROL!
Trump is showing signs of somebody losing an election
He even use words of God bit he himself doesn't even know to pray
Vote for trump
"this is said by a man that tried to steele the last election.this guy is a lying fool,and is not fit to be the president of our country"
SICK MAN!
Just put on the white hood already Trump hahaha... 😂
You are out of control and how dare you even say Gods name
What the hick he is seeing
"Joe, don't try to explain the actions and words of someone who has gone off the rails."
This man has no morals whatsoever and anyone that votes for him or even likes him you honestly have no morals or anything about you either
Stoking great replacement white fears; rallying cry. Giving permission to act on their hate. Haitian immigrants in Ohio pulled down the curtain.<br>Not all Trump supporters are racists; but all racists are Trump supporters. Complicity is just a bad.
"I’ve been travelling in Europe, and every one of the many Americans that I have met is deeply embarrassed, ashamed. He is hated."
Most blue areas on the policial map are in the major cities where the uneducated live and have low IQS thats a fact the red areas are in the suburbs and rurualaresa
"Problem is, I tend to support Republican policy.  Sadly, there is none, not anymore.  All of this BS rhetoric...  I stopped voting Republican in 2015.  I'm not a Democrat, but I have morals.  I cannot, in good conscious, support this man.  I pray for the sanity of the GOP.  Better or worse, our country needs different parties with varying viewpoints.  It's how to stay centric.  This is not the answer.  Please, ""sir,"" STOP!  GO AWAY!"
"In 5 of these clips, he was reading off the teleprompter (including all the ones talking about his opponent being mentally impaired)."
"Only a candidate without a track record of success in office, and no plan to work on behalf of the American people, would campaign using personal insults, racism, threats of retaliation towards people who criticize or disagree with him.  His threats of violence are unacceptable.  He has no honest criticism of Harris so he has to resort to this.  Pathetic."
I always wondered how Germany could’ve possibly elected a guy like Hitler……..After seeing Trump I get it now……
And he wonders why people are shooting at him
"The worst man alive. TBH, worse than ISIS, because at least I *understand how those people stayed horrible. He had every advantage (except loving parents) and turned into this parody of human flesh."
As an Australian watching you guys from overseas this is honestly so entertaining. If Trump wins it would be so hilarious.
PLEASE !!!!!Vote blue 💙 💙💙💙💙💙
"When he talks about Dems replace the word ""Cheating"" with the word ""Winning"" and you get what he is saying."
He’s so disgusting!
Harris saids strike is not a concern thats a real leader that dont care about the impact on consumers
He needs medical and psychiatric attention asap. He is desperate and the closer it gets to Election Day it’s only going to get worse and he’s only going to incite more violence and bold about his racism. The crowd that applauds him is such a disappointment. It’s sad to know there’s people out there who support his BS.
"Harris is such a JOKE!!  $525 billion to Ukraine, $750 billion to illegals and $700.00 for Maui families, that’s Kamala Harris America! Liberals are so ignorant and misguided"
"“I am the least racist person there is anywhere in the world!”<br>Yeah, you're as ""least racist"" as Hannibal Lecter is a ""real"" person."
"Trump's bitter because his wife married him for money. He has to pay for p*<b>*</b> Ever since he was younger, he had always had to pay for it pathetic."
Nothing stinks worse than frightened millionaire ‘news’ idiots afraid they will be in trouble when Trump wins. The stench is over powering with each successive lie blathered.
"Any kind of illegal but previously accepted level of cheater, you better run for the hills pal."
What an evil and hateful person.
"Was he looking in the mirror when talk about Kamala? What an evil, unintelligent person he is and has been. Speaking of speaking English, he’s not even good at speaking the language."
Best part of it all is i heard more clapping at my sons 5th grade graduation
His hair is purple now instead of orange
What´s new? Dirty Donald being dirty Donald again.
INVASION OF FLIES!!!
"You say a whole lot of misinformation.   She cheated on the last debate.  Trump will win.   The masses see how incredibly messed up the Kamala, tampon Tim is.   They want every American to fall."
Trump needs to go after the Republicans because they are the ones CHEATING !!!
Pretty rich that Trump decries anyone for not speaking English. He speaks BOLLOCKS every time he opens his flappy insane mouth.
When Trump says the Democrats are cheating he's basically saying we're cheating but going to blame them
How people defend Trump is beyond me.
How can any one with even an ounce of intelligence support this buffoon. ?
Does Trump go to the stage after getting drunk. I can’t believe this is  America
The Orange one is losing it <br> 🎃
Listening to this man makes me very literally feel sick to my stomach. How can anyone be cheering for this? Make it make sense.
They are not so stupid??😂
Why are we subjected to clips of this waste of oxygen?  Can't you just report on what was said?
Trump is a fraud. I bet all of his supporters have been scammed easy. Because they're being scammed right now
Someone should change his diaper it stinks again
"Why is Donald's hair purple? Did he come out? You are right Donald, there is something missing in Kamala that you have more of than almost anyone in history, and that is ignorance."
every where thats not all white is a problem and cheating according to trump
Trump is the only person that has been able to make the right show their true side
Liar  DJT... CRAZY FOLLOWERS
"Watching the campaign from the UK and totally supporting the Harris/Walz ticket not only am i horrified by Trumps racist rhetoric but I am simply astounded by real Republicans not coming out in greater numbers to denounce Trump and his MAGA followers. It needs the grand old Statesmen and women to make more effort to stop the destruction of the GOP. How Trump gained the party’s nomination as THEIR candidate is beyond me. Thank God living this side of the pond I don’t have to face the consequences when Trump loses. He will never accept defeat due to his mental capacity however big the Harris/Walz majority is! You are voting to save not only The Constitution and your Democracy but also the freedom of mankind around the globe. Trump doesn’t just need sentencing he needs gagging, a straight jacket and a padded cell sooner rather than later. Serious times ahead I fear. Vote Blue in massive numbers on November 5th to give hope for a safer future and freedom at home and abroad. The UK stands with a Democratic United States of America💙💙"
5 weeks and this foolishness goes to prison for life and his victims will get paid off
This poor man...
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao-Dsq5OJTA&t=117"">1:57</a> calling Harris stupid as he attempts the difficult feat of putting a piece of paper into his pocket."
"Children in the schools can't speak English? In that case, during some of the daytime, they should be taken to a place that provides some sort of education."
The media has normalized trumps behavior.
Where is the evidence behind your Claims Donald Trump???
5 weeks before people are going to die because of the media
Trump is such a lowlife!!!
Trump is Evil.  I pray he loses the election because Trump is very sick mentally.  He projects all his sins on to others.  If you want an end of chaos and violent rhetoric vote for Kamala.
"This is all he has? He is going to lose so badly with this. So old, so tired."
Joe Scarborough is a clown 🤡
Mean
He is beyond mentally impaired.
"I am from the state of Wisconsin, and I am so Ashamed of my fellow Wisconsinites who are foolish enough to fall for the words of this Wannabe Dictator"
When is he getting arrested for defamation  of Haitians.
Trust me it's just gonna get worse and worse....with the last 2 weeks before the election he and the Russians will throw the kitchen sink at Kamala. Comey gave it to him last time...he will be looking for Comey II
I’m a Poll Worker in a swing state-that will ultimately decide the outcome of this election. I’m really disgusted with his rhetoric!! Trump has no idea what civic duty is. Why is this deplorable man still allowed to be the Republican candidate?? European leaders are questioning this- yet we’ve got people in this country supporting him?! That is almost as scary as Trump himself!!
Why trump isn’t talking about the crazy white man that tried to shoot him— because they weren’t non-white or immigrants.
"Lock him up now, those new threats. One rough hour on You Trump, done."
the dictator Mr. trump!
"I just vomited out my breakfast listening to these two. I would be very very happy if Trump won by a landslide and your ratings would drop so much that MSMBC would have no choice but fire you. People like you would never be invited to our house for dinner. After years of horrible personal attacks against Trump you have a nerve for complaining when he, Trump, pays you back with same. You two should get a real job and get your hands dirty and see how real people live. You are a good example of ""White privilege"" . I realize that this comment will be deleted but I feel better now that I got it of my chest."
So mudslinging does not exist anymore? Must be forgetting about political cartoons 😅
"Sounds true to me , from what I’ve seen."
at lease he speaks his mind. the current president can’t even speak
"Donnie, you are campaigning because otherwise you would be in jail. Not because dems cheat.<br>Vote people 💙💙💙💙💙"
Trump is such a racist it’s actually quite terrifying 😢
His own daughter said under oath she believed he lost. <br>And what's up with saying he's putting people in jail but saying Biden was the one that weaponized the justice department (so well he indicted his own son 😂)
"So unhinged, unstable and unfit."
Files are attracted to shi....
Files are attracted to shi....
Trump was born with a full diaper for a brain like all his followers.
Hey Trump u wanna put the death penalty on the list like u did for blk and Mexican teens who were innocent  ?
HE can't speak English!!!
Only “out of control” in states he lost in 2020???
Wouldn't know a stupid person if he looked in the mirror
The irony of calls to “enforce the laws” when fat Jan 6. Sentences are clearly working.  Those proud boys are acting like school children now!  I bet no one touches the Capitol this year!
Looks like Barney
Every. Accusation. Is. A. Confession.
He is beyond the pale
Evil Vile man  he's Projecting. Talking about himself.
The utter CRAP he was spewing from his mouth brought flies to hom
He’s got nothing left but extreme hatred. It’s just sad at this point 😢
why do you cover these idiotic speeches?
Could the Donald bring his college transcripts so that we can compare them to Kamala's?
Trump has never said anything negative about Indians. MSNBC has tried pushing the racist against blacks bs for so long now they are claiming it's against Indian women too. Because KAMALA AINT BLACK!!!
This may be the vilest person on the planet!
Misleading news!!<br>Your goal is to reach out people who does not research enough and distract Americans from pressing matters that the country faces!<br>Ban Mainstream Media!!
"""If god came down from a high"" 😂😂😂 But they propaganda paving the way for future violence is terrifying. Donald Hitler Trump."
Every Trump accusation is in reality of self-confession.
plain loser
Flies smell the Bull___.
It’s an embarrassment for the USA !
You just need to find someone with better a*m.
"Borders a mess, inflation is sky high, major conflicts in europe and the middle east <br><br>We can not have 4 more years of this- tim walz"
Trump is weird racist lying nut job...
The people who are supporting this hate and lunacy are absolutely DISGUSTING ! 💙Harris/Walz 2024
"When you have been sued by the City of New York for racial discrimination 120 time and lost every time,  Your a racist!"
Smart and intelligent people know he is projecting. Except his supporters.
MSNBC focused more on his character rather then what he can do.  Happy faces and love and humility does not lower inflation.
He's talking about himself
I still know people with Down that have more sense.
You can't fix stupidity
"America scares me on the level of the debate, this is so basic, low intelligence… low level arguments…in russia or china there is no debates… they must be laughing"
Hes out of control somebody get the net😂
"She was ""born that way""? Cue an endorsement from Lady Gaga."
Watching from England and hoping the American people do the right thing in November and that Trump rots his miserable life away in prison.Left wondering how he can have a base support at all .
"Whenever Trump resorts to racist and demeaning attacks against VP Harris, it's because he knows he's not at her level and has nothing to amount to her level of intelligence and experience. Trump was born with a silver spoon and supposedly went to the best schools money can afford, but still behaves as if he was in a jungle with no basic human training.<br><br>It's sad that the media is still trying to logically compare Trump's crazy antics against VP Harris's logical sense. America, you have two types of elections going on at the same time - one with hateful rhetoric and an unhinged candidate who wouldn't be allowed to travel to most countries, and the other with a highly qualified candidate who is ready for the task.<br><br>I don't even know why the race is still close; it's mind-blowing for some of us non-Americans observing from the outside. Trump is riding off his privilege, and it's encouraged by Republicans and MAGA supporters.<br><br>There's no way Americans would tolerate this kind of behavior from VP Harris. We all know black people, especially black women, are harshly judged by different standards in all sectors, including politics.<br><br>What happened to political candidates arguing on policies instead of racist attacks and lies? America is supposed to be the beacon of democracy, but it looks like this ship sailed when extreme right rhetoric became the norm.<br><br>You stayed silent when Trump started attacking President Obama with birtherism lies. You normalized insults when he bullied Hillary Clinton on a national stage, and nobody jumped to stop his behavior when he followed her on stage during the debate - behavior that would get someone fired in any company.<br><br>You give him more airtime to spit his lies when he lost in 2020 and still cover him when he taunts President Biden during his presidency for the last four years. The media, who are more focused on sensational news to sell, are equally complicit in Trump's unhinged behavior.<br><br>You bear the responsibility to not cover him as you do. The world is watching, America. Do something in November and vote blue with a landslide to erase any doubts.<br><br>Meet Trump, Republican lawmakers, and the MAGA movement with your vote, and show them divisive rhetoric and racism have no place in the world. All the different ethnic groups in America need to show him the door away from the Oval Office. The world is counting on you."
smooth brain clowns don't breed
"Oh Trump wants to go back and review the 2020 election does he? Is that the one where your side hired 18 “Fake Electors” to pretend that Donald Trump won who are now in various steps of the judicial process? Well maybe we should review that election, AND the one in 2016 where Donald Trump lost the popular vote, but still ended up as president anyway."
"That crowd supports his rhetoric because they agree with him.  They are bigoted, racist, Xenophobic, hate-filled people. They are not patriots. They don't care about this country. They are grotesque. His rhetoric is horrifying..it is disgusting..it is scary & so is Trump & what his followers support. We have to acknowledge it and fight against it with everything we have. We can not afford to get tired of fighting back. We can't look away. We have to confront this head on."
He’s starting to sound more and more like Jim Jones.
"Oh Trump wants to go back and review the 2020 election does he?

Well maybe we should review that election, AND the one in 2016 where Donald Trump lost the popular vote, but still ended up as president anyway."
How foolish of me. To kid myself into believing that Trump had bottomed out. Yet he continues to find much sicker lows. He is going to his rallies looking half dead. Voice barely above a whisper. And yet falling further into madness. Very difficult to watch. Even sadder Is  his rhetoric is even more pathetic. He has nothing. And now all he can do is attack and insult Kamala Harris about things that are actually happening to him. His brain is much worse than a kindergarten child resorting to childish name calling. Scarey to watch the human brain diminish in such a manner. Can he lead our Nation. NO. But someone should lead him to where he can get help. He needs it Badly.
The left just doesn't get it! Maybe they should watch all the videos of grieving parents whose loved ones have become victims of immigrant crime! Or the angry residents of Chicago and other cities who see their precious public resources going to put up immigrants in fancy hotels!
"Daily reminder, Democrat controlled mainstream media is propaganda media.<br>Do not believe the people who spew Russia Russia Russia lies.<br>Trump 16, 20, 24"
Speaking like a guy who knows the embarrassing L is coming
MSNBC y’all need to be a shame of yourself you never said anything about Trump all you love is her and everyone know it … I will never watch y’all again
The part I don’t get is who cheers and wants to hear the president call someone stupid? The president used to get looked up to and highly respected and always held themselves to a certain standard. No matter which party. They were presidential. The fact the this clown attacks and insults to create division and so many people are cheering and proud is what scares me about what’s to come!!! Vote!! Vote!! Vote!! We won’t go back
North Carolina just got crushed by a hurricane. Since there not Ukraine Kamala goes to a L.A. fundraiser with elites. A glimpse of what a Kamala Presidency looks like
When will this madness ever end?!
I think he will get mad and mad and crazy as long as November 5th is approaching.. because he is very sad to suggest that he will loose against a woman something that he never anticipated.. maybe in January 6 2025 he will go crazy
And his zoombie followers applaud and celebrate. Unbelievable
"the clapping and cheering, seriously disturbing"
"It’s really sad to realize that there are tens of millions of Americans who are hateful, racist and ignorant. To believe obvious lies is about as stupid as you can get."
"Mentally impaired talking to mentally impaired !   What is going on over there, how can the be tied, has this country gone half crazy?  If Trump wins, the western world will split!"
Yikes. Stephen MIller is clearly writing his speeches.  This is really disgusting.
He's just repeating what others are saying about him trying to put it to Kamala.
"Donald Trump is so afraid to lose and that's why he is so out of controle crazy that the small  time that's still left till november 5 he obviously only wants to use his spare time with ranting, screaming and calling Kamala Harris nasty insiulting names ! <br>In short : by doing so he is only digging his own grave !"
Not immigrants but  illegal immigrants. Funny how that works.
"This crazy man is just saying anything that comes in his head. He don't know nothing about the schools in Springfield,  he's never been there."
This is no long political rivalry but it’s became a cult .. he will try and he will never succeed in politic
Sad. Really sad.
"Young people in Germany burnt books in public after Hitler won the election. I was watching a movie about that and felt how horrible it must have been to be “normal” at that time watching that happening and not being able to do anything to stop it. It’s sad that I’m living through something similar now. Never have I imagined that we get to live through it, too."
"Has he been watching The Purge? <br>At this point his mind is mush and he's scared. But he and his enablers have been hiding this fact for years by throwing it onto Biden. Even on his worst day, Biden makes more sense than this loser."
Evils are people<br>Who supports this guy
It's not racist to tell the truth. Why do dimocrats hate America so much that they want to import  millions of criminals and poor people? Easy!! Then they want an amnesty and then these people that have no idea how our country works can vote for free stuff the dimocrats promise.
What an azz-h__e !!!!!!
White jacket with long sleeves labeled Trump long overdue
He's a sick M'fr!!!!
recall that Trump wanted to execute the Central Park 5
He can not comprehend losing to a woman.
"Twenty days after the election, Trump will find himself incarcerated."
Domestic terrorism is criminal and treasonous ~<br>President Biden needs to exercise the core power and duty of his office to jail<br>trumpl$tilt$kin<br>and all of hi$ coconspirators !<br>the corrupt scotus decision made it a no brainer.<br>Vote 🟦 🇺🇸
He is Evil
"As a devout Democrat...............I want to hear Trump's plan............but I don't get it...........why not?  What does he mean when he calls people stupid, mentally impaired, etc.  I don't understand.  I would really like to know the logic behind his name calling.  There must be a logical reason.????????"
"Worst american in history. This country will remain ugly and a laughingstock even after he is imprisoned, because his sick messages still resonate with too many of this country's dumber half."
I guarantee that Trump's rhetoric is leading up to him calling Harris the N-word. Mark my words.
The boy who cried wolf is back. Do they not realize that one day they will need to tell people that someone is actually racist. And no one will care while they scream it is true this time!
How could anyone every consider voting for this deranged man.  He desperately needs to be institutionalize and get the serious help he needs.   Listening to these people cheering the liars and fear mongering he’s doing are just as impaired as he is and should seek mental help. VERY SCARY! VERY SCARY!
If God had the time to come down....He'd most likely strike Donny down with leprosy and make him eat grass for 14 years.
Trump is promising to prosecute cheaters on this election.<br><br>Merrick Garland!!!!! DO YOU HEAR THIS? 🎉🎉🎉🎉<br><br>Garland better be ready to do his job this time. Trying to ignore what Trump did in the last election until 2023 is why we are in the state we are in now.
"I decided to put Kamala's and Trump's plans side by side on every issue.<br>Trump is like ""We are gonna get rid of that bad thing and replace it with this wonderful plan that's beautiful and the most perfect solution in the history of our nation.""<br>Kamala is like, ""Here are our solutions, the data, the figures, and real examples of places where these policies have been enacted and their results. Also, here are the citations to credible resources that back up our claims""<br><br>THIS ELECTION IS NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!!!!!!<br><br>People, please read her 81-page economic policy plan...I love that she dropped the ""unrealized gains"" tax and wants to tackle weak supply chains that are the root cause of inflation."
This news channel is a disgrace… just report the news and shut up. Trump has my vote !!
TRUMP IS BEGINNING TO SOUND MORE AND MORE LIKE JIM JONES.
Trump is already meeting with Zelenskyy to end the war. If you truly value peace you'd vote trump.
Vote blue for women's rights
"Trump w melt down, he is weak racism is fear, fear nothing love all, please vote 👊🏽"
DonOLD was born morally-challenged.<br>Trump lies the way that most of us breathe in air.
Dolt45 has gone full-blown Adolph.
He is made possible by the enablers in office and his magat cult voters
And Republicans wonder why certain entities want/wanted to take him out…
"WHAT'S WRONG WITH HARRIS IS SHE IS SMARTER, A LOT SMARTER THAN TRUMP."
"Excuse me it’s Springfield, Ohio. Not Ohio Springfield, better give that brilliant brain some adderall, your brain is scattering again and again and again and again, etc."
I am not following US election politics and logged in after a while and this is quite disturbing. Since he came on stage in 2016 I have not seen good things. It is amazing that the republicans cannot find anyone better than TRump.
"Trump is a dark evil liar. He constantly projects. He is the one with a problem, malignant narcissist. He has unravelled. I look forward to him losing and being Away from the public. Vote Blue and vote for Kamala!"
"One of my step-sons, when he was a little boy about 5 yrs old, ....used to call things/people 'stupid' which he didn't like or understand.     Trump is lower than that level, with an added mean-streak."
"Every rally the hate is turned up more and more, it's at this point sounding more venomous than ever and it shows his heartlessness"
"Every Person Donal Trump names should sue him for slander.  By definition, it is a sure win every time."
Dear Lord how much longer this is going to go on I don't live in America and I am tired of him
"Hey peabrain Trump, try putting the photos of the thousands of USA born Americans guilty of those same crimes in the past year on the stage. <br>What a child Trump is."
I remember the fly that sat on top of Mike Pence head during his debate. Perhaps we'll see trump swallow one next.
"Who is everybody? He always says ""everybody knows it""!  He is standing there with purple hair,  so who's mentally unstable to run for president?"
Where is joyful caring we must come together Kamala ?for the US citizens devastated by these storms???
trump is losing...again....
The darkness is reaching out for the darkness.
Look into the mirror Donald J Trump😢
They can't put this monster in jail? What is going on in America.. Do we have Americans that want to give their freedoms up? It says a lot about this country 😢
"How can someone exhibit such vile & evil intent & still have support  in ""the land of the free, & the home of the brave""? Get rid of Trump."
"Violent day...did trump just promote a purge?!! <br>How is this guy allowed to even run. The worst thing about his whole political introduction is there will be others like him that will follow. Before, anyone who thought like him, talked like him, had convictions like him would never dare to run for any office; he has just normalized it for other horrid people to now follow."
You can smell the desperation seeping from his every pore....gross.
Mindless Trump Puppets. This just go”s to show how mentally unstable These mentally challenged people are that listens and Believes his rants.
"all projections. Everything he identifies as personality traits belonging to Harris, he exhibits in spades."
Poor poor man he is very very sick 😊😊😊😅aw😊
waiting for the racist remarks??? hello?
34 Felonies
Fake news same old garbage
STOP giving him prime time. You are enablers of reprehensible behavior.
demokkkrats lololol
"Those cheating DNC flies.  hehe.  This stupid country, hehe"
"Kamala is the axe in this Turkish proverb:<br><br> The forest was shrinking, but the trees kept voting for the axe; for the axe was clever and convinced the trees that because his handle was made of wood, he was one of them."
"If liberal viewers were smart and STOP voting by identity politics  they would  notice that Cnn, msnbc has nothing positive to say about Trump and all glory to kamala  who both sides reported that she was  the worst VP in history and now she is the best thing slice bread. They are pandering to you with empty promises! <br><br>Nevertheless, Kamala has no policies ans she recently stole Trump legislation promise to enact of No taxes on tips! She is a thief and fraud. Her voters are choosing her only on her gender and race. <br><br>Btw. Not all Jamaicans are Black. Her father is Asians and Irish Jamaican mix. <br><br>Vote Trump and bring back law and order, no identity politics, no racial division, no castration of children,  no men in women sports, lower inflation  so we can afford to buy a home again , food again, lower gas prices again, energy independent again ( we were almost there) and a stronger border and negotiations to end the proxy war we are in now."
Trump will become more extreme as he desprately glutches for power
Trump's grandfather was an immigrant-Wikipedia
TRUMP AGAIN FOR PRESIDENT 🇺🇸 2024!
"We all have problems from birth, even bone spurs"
"I am truly scared… My boyfriend is a daca recipient and I am really scared for him. He’s been in this country since he was three years old. He knows his country as his home. He’s college educated pay taxes here more than a lot of people more than Donald Trump did $750 ???not fair for a millionaire to pay less than someone who makes $50,000 a year that is just baffling to me."
One more month of his mouth.
Harris walz  vote
You can see how much Trump is hurting after being humiliated by Harris in their recent debate.  It's clearly eating him up every day. I wonder how much sleep he is getting?
"He is flat out insane. Calling someone mentally disabled who wiped the floor with him in a debate.  Stop him, Americans. Harris / Walz have to win in a landslide."
This Lunacy needs to end! How can anyone that backs this man sleep at night?
AMERICAS BIGGEST CRIMINAL Fraud finds out AMERICANS ARE SICK TO DEALTH OF HIM ! HIS WORDS ARE WORTHLESS !
Calling her stupid while she destroyed him in the debate is hilarious
Hillary and Maduro sitting in a tree...😂😂😂
"I'm starting to think Trump doesn't want to win the election anymore. He wants to lose, and use his supporter's revolt against it as an excuse for an uprising. If he wins there wont be enough destruction and mayhem for him."
"Trump is done, he has lost what's left of his small, feeble mind. He needs to go away now. VOTE BLUE DOWN BALLOT!"
Trump for Pressie!!! 🎉
"This guy has to lose if you’re not a billionaire and you vote for him, you’re voting against your own interests period"
Only sheep watch and believe this fake news propaganda
LOL HOW IS LAURA LOOMER DONALD?
There's a fly on the podium because they are drawn to rotting meat.
You democrats are losing it because you know you’re about to lose the election! 😂
Shut up already... the lips keep flapping nonsensical...<br>The fly came to land on 💩
Trump knows this works.<br><br>1. He has main/side media fully focused on every rubbish he spews while relegating news about Harris to fine print. <br><br>2. Ask the British how seemingly level headed people voted to exit the EU then started goggling “what is EU” after the referendum passed. It was mostly due to peddling fear. Fear of immigrants. Fear of people who don’t look like you. Fear that “those people” will take something away from you. <br><br>It works like magic and he knows it. That’s why he outsmarted us in 2016 and might just do so again. <br><br>What may save us this time is a stronger fear from women on what life would become for their uterus and freedoms under his dictatorship.
"Youre all such a bunch of sheep lol, go actually look at what the black community thinks of Trump and what hes done for them, dont listen to these puppets lol"
Trump is saying EVERYTHING that he is which has NOTHING to do with VP Kamala Harris.
just another example as to why Trump is too dangerous and his rhetoric is becoming more and more violent!
Republicans and Donald Trump all are projectionists
If this were your 78 year old uncle speaking this way in public you would be putting him in a nursing home
"Dumb donald needed his daddy's help to get into good schools. Now his nypd mafia are using the same school cheating network to get their own dumb sons into top schools, particularly a top college in western Massachusetts."
The only crock running for president is Donald Trump.<br>His followers are dumb as a rock.
trump is very sick person...he needs meds and doctor
It took THREE hours to end January 6. Remember? UNDER DONALD TRUMP.
"Even BALLOTS in California can be requested in different languages like Spanish, and Chinese. But we all know one of the requirement for becoming a citizen is to be able to read/write in English. That proves  those who get these ballots are not citizens."
Miscroscopic crowd....did you see Harri's crowd in Las Vegas?  100 to 1...maybe 1000 to 1. Can we flush this turd once and for all? I live in PA and it embarrasses me to see my fellow PA people clap for this turd.
He believes only God he trusts with votes! Does not this mean that he wouldn’t accept the vote results?
Wow he's getting very desperate
"Kamala has been and is a LIAR, INCAPABLE AND CORRUPT"
"Historically speaking, its republicans who mostly do the cheating during election time. Gerrymandering especially."
"TRUMP IS SLOW, DUMB, AND IGNORANT.....IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT TRUMP OR HIS SUPPORTERS SAY...........GOD HAS POSITIONED KAMALA HARRIS TO BE THE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.........YOU ALL CANNOT STOP GOD."
Always play the race card MSNBC
He reminds me of the man with the little moustache from Germany.
trump is out of control!!! You wouldn’t even believe GOD himself
ALWAYS someone else's fault. Trump is going to take the whole GOP down...and I can't wait.
"I live in W. PA...and I can tell you driving the rural roads...there are a LOT less, sometimes NO, Trump signs for miles.Much different than 2020. Of course that doesn't mean they won't vote...so make sure YOU VOTE FOR HARRIS/WALZ..<br><br>.....and if you can donate ANYTHING to the Harris campaign...please do. Or Ruben Gallego in Texas or Jon Tester in Montana. We can NOT lose in November.Harris needs the Oval AND Congress."
If Kamala was not mentally ill then she would not allow 10s of thousands criminals and murderer enter our country while being border czar. If she is not mentally ill then she is a TRAITOR to America and did act of treason.
Why can’t he be STOPPED!!!!!
Hear the trained seals clapping in the background
"I’m worried about Trump, but I’m much more worried about the fact that there are enough Americans supporting this crazy bigot to make this electoral race a “close one”. It’s unbelievable…and for the second time in a row…"
"The red MAGA hats have become a modern symbol of division and hate, much like the white sheets once worn by those who stood for bigotry and fear. Trump's rhetoric has emboldened a dangerous rise in racism and extremism, and it's clear that these red hats represent more than just a political preference—they stand for the intolerance and ignorance tearing our country apart. We must reject this dark path and instead stand for equality, justice, and unity. Vote Blue to ensure that America moves forward, not back into the shadows of hatred and division."
"He’s a very smart smart guy if he only had a brain, he’d a brain!"
Trump is making US ridicule in front of the rest of the world.
Look. the hole world is holding their  breath. Trump is so.........if he wins I really feel sorry for all Americans. I have always looking up to USA but what have happened with your politic???Thank God for Kamala. Sweden is holding its breath
They have to be taught.  Let's attack Americans because of how they look or what language they speak?!  This is not America.
😂
"Trump is going to the area that is destroyed by hurricane to see for himself of what happened and what needed to be done. On the other hand Harris is going to DC, and just will be briefed by others  on what happened and what needs to be done, EXACTLY like what she did for the borders."
"How any American, with all of their faculties, even consider voting for Donald Trump , is mind boggling."
"So, this is what a cult looks like as it withers. maga = BYE BYE!!"
What is the crowd cheering at?? There is no bottom to this barrel
"The scarriest thing is not even Trump, it's the people that are so ignorant and uneducated to really support anything that comes from his mouth. These people think they are patriotic, but instead are helping a potential dictator to power. The fact that he still has almost half of the country voting for him, is deeply troubeling."
And democrats are failing!<br>The FCC just fast tracked the George Soros purchase of 220 plus radio stations before November's election. They have never skipped the review process which usually takes 6 to 9 months. Now you see the Democrat party in full View. There are no rules or laws that can't be broken

"How can this be accepted by anyone in the US? Imagine kids  hearing an 'adult' behave like  a teen bully. <br><br>And this man is the best the Republican party could get?<br><br>I am not sure if the US will come back from this, as the appeasement the last period has made it worse."
"You are such a darn liar and your derogatory remarks are tasteless and harmful and unkind!  Remember when you point a finger   Three point back at you! And if you want something done, ask a woman! The fly is looking for the heap of sh1t talking!"
He started his political career by asking for Barack Obama's birth certificate. Then said he would build a wall on the border and ban all Muslims. Trump has made it extremely clear to the voters from day one that he is a racist full of hatred.
"Yet, the two people that tried to take him out were white American Republican men."
I still find it incredibly ironic that he calls her mentally impaired when he can't even pronounce her name correctly.
"trump in his insane rants must be talking about himself, vote blue because our sanity depends on the outcome of the election."
So much projection. How can his people accept this behavior.
"Here it is, trumpists do not watch news.  They do not pay attention to what trump does.  The internet has condensed them in groups.  When you ask what did trump do for you, they answered with 2016 garbage.  These items are talked about in those internet groups.  This is why when they finally go to a rally they leave.  Then back to the internet."
Well flies do love a nice peice of S***
Side by side ads with this “ mental “ speech. Cut in Kamala saying if you have something to say say it to my face in a second debate.
That fly was around his soiled Depends!!!
Guaranteed to win the racist votes!
"So nobody in Springfield,Oh schools, no one can speak English huh!?  This guy is seriously sick in the head."
"This is a mentally impaired man, how dare he insult people out there actually suffering from this disability."
Remember Barron Trump got mental issues also..Trump be careful with your language
Do those idiots who are cheering realize that there are white criminals also.Trruummpp is the first one who is going to be locked 🔒 up
Mika's face tho...lmbo
"Getting the sense that, when Trump was a kid, his crayon box was all white crayons.  The other crayon colors were ""deported"" to the garbage can."
Trump talks about his own mental state…..please how long can you Americans listen to this narsictic liar. It is so embarrassing. How far reaches freedom of speech in America??? Take care and vote BLUE
What’s the IQ of most of the people in his crowd.
might be time for biden to get seal team 6 involved
Listening to him is it sounds like Jim Jones and he is serving orange kool aid to his red hat followers
PoopFaceDonald
"I think this election is a true measure of the quality of people that this nation has. I will get to the point, in layman's terms, and let me say this is seldom acknowledged because everyone is more interested in being superficially politically correct than addressing the obvious issue of humanity's problems at the root core. There is also ignorance which blinds the mind and spirit of many. <br><br> Black and White are the basic colors of the duality that has existed ever since the 33 percent of fallen angles fell from the grace of God to earth, according to scriptures, and created havoc on the Adamic ""organic,"" seed of earth, by mixing DNA.   If any particular body of individuals has poisoned the bloodline of Adam, it is these fallen rebels, and usurping dominion of earth from such. But it has been twisted by the same wicked bloodlines in the form of projection, sound familiar with the tactics used in this election? <br><br>Earth has been far too long ruled by bloodlines of these fallen entities, and I do believe that the only filter to the origins of the organic fabric of earth will be by what type of spirit people have in them, when all is said and done, as we are so diversly blended, and it is hard to tell sometimes who is of wicked or good spirit. Only God knows the true nature of each individual. <br><br>Since good always prevails, I am optimistic that the leader of choice is obviously clear to any decent human being and citizen of this nation. I mean how can it not be, when the opposite is so vile in spirit and rhetoric."
Trump will win. Vote Trump. Vote Maga
I get my mail-in ballot tomorrow in Florida. Voting Democrat across the board.
Kamala is so creepy and she will lose by a huge margin..
Not racist at all.. most of the time the truth HURTS! 😂
Harris should sue him for slander
Kamala made a fool out of Trump in the debate. What does that say about his mental capacity.
This man CAN NOT be President. 💙💙💙💙💙
"This is insane! This is terrifying! Scarier is that people are cheering for his violent threats! If Kamala wins through their voter suppression schemes, I fear we will see violence in America like we've never seen here before"
Trump's parents were immigrants and all he marries are immigrants.
"Horrible ""speech"" by the former  President."
"Harris is way more intelligent, wise, intellectual  than trump  ,even a 5 year old kid can make such a distinction. The stupidest 78 year old who  ever lived"
One rough decade is what we have suffered through.
"Just keep trump under the microscope, you don't have much longer to go. And don't ask important questions like why did Harris cover up Joe's cognitive decline and don't ask why Biden/Harris DOJ are trying to get illegals to vote in  Alabama?"
..what a horrible person trump it...
The stupid trump
"Remember, with narcissists, every accusation is an admission."
"And Trump will die that way,never used his one braincell given at birth."
Trump spouting his greatest hits. I’ll be happy when we don’t have to hear from him again.
"In any other supposedly civilised country in the world, Trump wouldn’t get near a presidential election. What’s going on , America. This is soooooo dangerous."
"Trump is telling people what they want to hear.  Not everyone buys into his lies but one heck of a lot do believe him.  And that is a gigantic problem for you, your partner, your kids and me.  And I am not even a citizen of the USA.  The United States of America.  Trump will change that to Ununited States of America.  Just listen to what he plans and you just might see that he is following an age old rule in war - ""divide and conquer"".  MAGA people need to understand that.  I do hope that the rest of the US citizenry understands that fundamental reality also.  Course, I am an ordinary guy with my own opinion and I could be reading things wrong.  Trump just might be ""the chosen one"" - good grief!"
Republicans are concerned? They created this mess!
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao-Dsq5OJTA&t=270"">4:30</a>.  I think the fly smelt the bullsh1t from 50 miles away"
It's amazing.  There are teachers that speak Spanish all over the US.
I can't even listen to his voice anymore.  It makes me ill. 🤦‍♀️
The rare best that the VP Harris can do is ignore the orange turd completely! He is truly afraid and jump on with that he knows and Hussan all knowledge about that movie bullying
"The Irony is that at worst; even slave owners knew the economic value of their ""property"", MAGA racist are just plain stupid."
You guys got this all wrong. ......😳😳😳😳. Mr. Trump is not racist.....He is MAGA Racist...
This guy is a shmuck
Independence day 😅 coming
The man is deranged and dangerous.
"People say that Harris will win.  Trump and his inner circle know this as well.  Why isn't anyone talking about Trump and his lawyers in every swing state holding the state elector's hostage by having them not certify the result of that state.  No President-elect will become president if the states do not certify the results.  That's real.  Trumps legal team is gearing up to have state electors NOT certify the results.  And if you cannot certify, the vote goes to Congress.  That's the angle Trump is taking, and no one is talking about it.  Scary!"
Constitutional rights 101😅
can't wait until his trial is over and he's in prison.
"Its one thing to oppose Harris on policy.  I'm a democrat and plan to vote for her and I can think of a few things I don't agree with.  But Trump's hateful, personal attacks, based in lies; this dark vision Trump brings, that add no value in terms of a contrast between his policies and Harris'.  Ever since he came down that escalator nine years ago, bringing with him unprecedented corruption, immorality and hatred,  America has become a worse place for it.  People are tired of it, and want to turn the page on all that."
"Well, it takes one mentally impaired person to know another mentally impaired person. He is just the Narcissist projectiing his own faults onto others..."
Please name the high crimes and misdemeanors committed by Harris- You cant.
"I hate to say this, but boneheads are following a bonehead."
"He's been watching the ""purge"" dw thinks its real ffs!"
Still they are less impaired than he is.
"I pay attention, but one of the things I don't know: If a presidential candiadate were to pass away before the election (and I do mean of natural causes), who would become the new presidential candidate? Serious question."
Joe has to neg almost everything Mika says.
I am so tired of this man..I feel like we are being tortured every single day he opens his mouth
"Angry, old and desperate."
I hope to see some hard pushback from the Harris campaign because we know that there will be those who will swallow all the Trump BS whole.
The only one mentally disabled is Trump. He talks about people eating cats and dogs that is not true and hurt a town and many people just because he could not handle is crowd sizes being low and people walking out be mentioned by Kamala at the debate. Trump is not mentally well and unfit to hold office.
"Someone needs to explain to CNN, MSNBC, CBS, NBC, ABC that Trump is RIGHT about Kamala Harris NOT being black! She literally has zero African ancestry. Her mother is 100% Indian and her father is 1/2 Indian and 1/2 Irish. Her father was only born in Jamaica, and is NOT of Jamaican descent! Harris’ great great grandfather was a major slave trader, having owned 1200 slaves at one point!"
"Trump says there is something wrong with Kamala and we all know it. In all sincerity, Kamala's mental problem is that she's an alcoholic and has been compromised many times during public presentations. Kamala has many tell-tale signs of being inebriated when she responds to questions."
"Blame Blk communities for stealing an election again. Blks do not vote for a party that WS support. We do not vote for politicians that care more about Corporations and lobbyists more than people. We don't vote for politicians that try to control our lives. We do not vote for politicians that are blatant racist. We don't cheat, we vote and we especially vote in Presidential elections."
Flies are attracted to 💩
"Half of the US is not only responsible for the destruction of American democracy, but a danger to progress in the rest of the world. The other half of the US should do everything possible to make sure they vote on election day, to prevent this atrocity from happening!!!!"
"So he is calling for a Kristalnacht... yeah, I think I can see where he's going with this. 🤮🤮🤮"
"Look at his combover; he's given up trying to appear presentable.  That's a sign of mental decline.  He doesn't talk about policy; he lies about & attacks immigrants, mis-pronounces his opponents name & lies about her, attacks anyone who's ""disloyal"" to him.  He's not telling us how he'll make our lives better; he's telling us how he's going to use the machinery of government to destroy those who he hates.  This is a mentally very ill old man; there's no way anyone should trust him with anything important (as further documented & demonstrated by his stealing of national secrets & classified information) ..."
You trump is out of control
Total projection
Trump is so vicious
"When you have no arguments, no policies, you start insulting your opponent with lies. trump only tells lies."
We're watching a real Klan rally in 2024
You guys are sick! TDS 😂😂😂 WE SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOU TWO SHEEPLE FYI!
There is NOTHING racist about calling out the criminal invasion of our country!
"Where is she or Biden for that matter now?  She is not the brightest crayon or much of a VP, but she could be in the south helping like Trump is doing right now."
This man very disgraceful.. trump WEAK !!! weak weak !
Hey Mutt and Jeff President Trump is in Georgia supporting the flood victims where is giggles downing a bottle of expensive wine on the taxpayer's dime?
She dusted Trump in the debate and he can't handle it.  She used his toupee to wipe the walls down then handed it back to him.  Now she living rent in his medulla oblongata😒
All the predominantly blk cities and states he talks about.
Vote blue up and down and let's put him in jail!!!!
"Some many millions continue to listen to him hopefully less than 2020. Even they must recognize that he is unqualified to confront and attempt to resolve the challenges at home and abroad that have nothing to do with the border and "" immigrants"" whoever he thinks they are. Is that enough for MAGA ? Probably is."
Trump  is  mentally   impaired… who  wants  a  president   Who  is  crazy
the voice of desperation
"Imagine living through these disastrous past four years and still wanting to vote for the exact same people who are responsible for all of it just because a specific someone whos been living in your head rent free for 9+ years since 2015 continues to hurt your fee fees with words and mean tweets, thats so weird, LOL. 💙❄️💧🤣"
JD Vances wife curried my KITTEN 😢
I know people still voting for Trump are legitimately ok with him as a human being. He's a terrible and racist person.<br><br>He has no policy so its not a policy thing<br><br>He wants the purge<br><br>And he's anti Black and Brown immigrants
"Want another delusional person…check out this tiktok mom 🤦🏽‍♀️ 👇🏽 <br> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CMeydi53U"">https://youtu.be/t-CMeydi53U?si=PJuOMQgTUev8GnM-</a>"
"FACT CHECK TYPE 2 Diabetes: For the most part I am in agreement with the outrage of fat-acceptance in this vide. HOWEVER, Type-2 diabetes does have a genetic component and can be experienced by someone who does live a healthy life style. That does NOT mean your life isn't in your control, probably means you need to continue being healthy and take medication to control your insulin/sugar levels. To say Type 2 diabetes is always someone's fault is ignorant. Some people cannot reverse their insulin dysregulation because their disease is too far advanced OR it's just their genetics. <br><br>Personal experience: I run on average 15km per week, weight train 1-3x per week, and eat a protein heavy diet. My BMI is 21.1 and in my mid-20s. + PCOS  Due to my family history / genetics, I'm ALMOST at the ""at-risk"" range for my A1C!! Even though I'm ""healthy"". <br><br>Type 2 has a ""VERY STRONG"" genetic component. <br><br>"" Type 2 diabetes has a stronger link to family history and lineage than type 1, and studies of twins have shown that genetics play a very strong role in the development of type 2 diabetes. Race can also play a role.
<br>
<br>Yet it also depends on environmental factors. Lifestyle also influences the development of type 2 diabetes.

If the obese had to pay for thier extra poundage daily they would lose wieght real quick. I GUARANTEE IT!
I don’t think anyone cares about health. It’s all about attraction and what comes with being seen as entirely ugly.

Its been three years since i broke my neck, ive had no surgery,  take no medication or oain killers except thc/cbd at night for inflammation,  and i can do calisthenics,  i lift 315 for reps on the bench, deadlift 525 for reps, and squat 225 , i cant squat heavy due to pressure on my neck and spine from the bar, but i KNOW i coukd do more , just not worth it.<br> I am sock of hearing the excuses! I get depression,  say that, dont say your bkdy js okay! Your depressed and lazy due to it, hut you can push out. Start small, go for a short walk every day for a week, tgen a longer walk, then matbe walk faster , then start short runs. Just start moving , moving will hekp change your thoughts and break the depression! If you need a friend or advice , im here, i am certified,  but i offer this free, i got certified for myself not for work, and im passionate about this! You ypu understand what i went though, i was told my life is over,  i had to accept it, get surgery and take oain killers forever and it was medically impossible to fix and there is nothing that can be done, now they wamt to study me lol, saying i reprogrammed my nervous system somehow which is also impossible! The bidy and mind can do anything you are patient enough and brave enough to work towards! The reward is freedom! I am a respected and known bodybuilder,  with a broken neck, that has won shows at 45 years old , gained 40 pounds of muscle. If i can do it anyone can!"
Just got surgery and they took photos of multiple areas of my body internally and can confirm that i do have fat around my organs
culture and environment do contribute to people becoming obese and these factors are outside of their control.   Modern culture has an obsession over food and rich recipes that exaggerate cravings rather than satisfy them.
Not fatties acting like being fat isn't a privilege again 🙄😬😹
"Ummmm ... ""he""... ??? 😂😂🤣🤣😂😂 and this weirdo thinks that being fat isn't a problem. So much denial here.. just buy them a one way ticket to Egypt 🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣"
"I don't have anything funny to say to that.<br>But, i'd like to say how how much i enjoy your channel!❤"
he? that's a woman.
"I'm 55, a lifelong smoker and while not in the best shape, I'm an active dirt biker so I'm not in the worst shape either. If their weight is so healthy, let us jog half a mile up a hill and see how incredibly agile these obese excuse makers are."
"""There's no evidence this, there's no evidence that"" but he doesn't cite one single article that explains why our current medical knowledge is so wrong. Oh, of course, it's because all scientists and MDs are evil little creatures that want to exterminate all the fattys so they deliberately frabicate all data against obesity, no article can be trusted. Unless the ones that say that xyz patients died after losing weight (they had cancer)"
"Remember, the same people who shouted ""trust the science!"" in 2020 are the same ones who are ignoring dietary and health science."
Why are you using her dead gender?
He still claims to be a doctor on his website.
The problem is she will just go on to become a health influencer or some stupid term like that and people will still follow her.
who are you calling HIM?does she think shes a him? makes sense shes delusional AF
"💩💩💩 millions of people who have a healthy weight, usually have a healthy diet and active lifestyle. That doctor deserves to be banned for life from practicing medicine."
This is what she wanted. She wanted to get fired and become a martyr to these people to take even more money from them. Much more money in that
"The worst part: she could have practiced in the NHS system, which is UK public healthcare, wasting that money on her lunacy."
That ford truck needs to shut up i was 410  im around 360 now best decision ive made to lose weight i feel better yes still trying to lose more
If it’s okay to be obese then why aren’t they okay with the word?
She says people should ACCEPT being fat and don't change their physical body. But couldn't accept her gender and sought to change it. LOL. Yes...SHE. I said SHE.
💩💩💩💩💩💩
"So basically, a doctor who doesn't believe in modern medicine. Seems like they chose the wrong profession, simple as that."
"Getting our weight,blood pressure and heart rate checked happens everytime I go to see a doctor. I thought it was normal"
“You can be healthy at all sizes!”<br><br>My family is every shape and size and half my family is either diabetic or has heart problems.
🙄
"Despite how bad they are, thank you for using his pronouns lol"
"Wait ""he""?"
you used 3 different pronouns for this woman
I may have reported this person 👀 thanks for bringing this to light in the first place.
I hated being fat so I started walking everyday list 80 lbs no excuse being fat is healthy
No fat around the organs. Explain T2 diabetes and fatty liver disease.<br><br>Also ozempic is not a weightloss drug
It's interesting to me how a lot of these weirdos have outsides that match their insides.<br>The vibe of this sudo-doc is petty and malicious. And his appearance certainly backs it up!
"I didnt really care about how my body look and still dont, so i ate whatever i like back then and became obese. But one day i ended up hospitalized because of high blood pressure. I dont care how my body look but i care about my health."
"A family friend is a GP. She struggles with her weight but always  is honest with her patients about her issues and tries to stay on track with her weight because she has seen what obesity can do, brother is a vet, he is at the gym every day because he says how can you tell someone their pet (and normally their owner) is overweight if you are too!"
Wait isnt that the same Person who claimed that Gender isnt Real but also claimed to transgender? If Gender isnt real being Transgender isnt real either your Idiot
Love Ya. Poop Emoji.
💩
She! The doctor is a woman.
Love the mini plastic dogs with mini Michelle!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=590"">9:50</a> in that context doesn’t “diet” just refer to a way of eating? meaning everyone has a diet. i think that’s what they meant. and by exercise they probably meant having a lack of it. not backing this person but just wanted to point that out haha"
He? Lol
"Weight loss is Harmful is only true in SOME cases like mine. Im underweight, but if your Obese and over just Obese, weight loss isnt harmful at all. Its just healthy"
I dont wish to be smaller <br>I wish to not die due to diabetes XDDDD
"if they really thought being fat was healthy they wouldnt mind getting on the scale or want doctors to only tell them what they want to hear. and if these people arent lazy, y is it that the only time they get up is to talk more stupid shit on social media like these video clips. with all the hard work they did talking all that shit they couldve lost weight by now"
"Listening to my body's cues is why I'm a type 2 diabetic. It's why I'm 40 pounds overweight. That extra weight is why my back pain from auto and work accidents is made even worse. <br><br>All those things are why I'm trying to fight those cues. Fighting against my body's cues is why I've lost 15 pounds in the last two months. And hopefully, will continue to lose more as I try to reverse, or at least hold off, the damage years of listening to my body's cues has done."
"@Michellemcd543 I am confuse, isn't this person a woman? why do you keep saying ""He""."
"So what are they supposed to do lie to you? It's true that certain illnesses won't be cured if you lose weight but I rather be at a healthy weight and manage it versus being obese and dealing with it. If anything there are major benefits in losing weight such as not struggling to move, fitting into clothes a lot better lowering your risk for obesity related risk and you even save more money when you control your portions at the supermarket. She sounds like that doctor Kat that basically said and wrote the same things but she died from complications of being obese."
i’m 7 minutes in and i just realised she kept saying he- that’s a man? 😭
"I am a 54 year old with extreme stomach issues. I have been 200 lbs all the way down to 90 lbs. I am not an adult designed to be that small. I literally looked like a walking skeleton. The other thing I went through was almost giving myself type 2 diabetes. I had developed a love for herbal teas that I sweetened with honey. Sounds healthy. The problem, as it turns out, was I was putting way too much honey in it. So it was more like a little tea with my honey.  Once my amazing nutritionist figured out what I was doing, we were able to turn it around. To hear a medical professional say type 2 diabetes is not your fault is crazy."
So she’s delusional about weight and gender…. That adds up. 😂
these doll videos are so fun I love them
That woman's an absolutely deranged narcissist.
That’s a man?
She’s crazy
And the doctor's ain't fat lifting up only a pen and a notebook
💩
"Michelle, you know that exercise can cause the weight gain - if you do anaerobic exercises a lot, your muscles will grown but you knows it already. Also diet also cause the weight gain because  diet is the sum of food consumed by a person, but dieting means the change eating habits to lose fat tissues.  For example, the anaroxic persons get a diet and an exercise plan (my close friend went through that) to gain weight. So by my opinion, fatdoctor just manipulates the terms. It is like if I have a lot jellyfish and can say that I have the fish tank, by term it is correct but jellyfish are the medusa-phase of certain gelatinous members of the subphylum Medusozoa (medusas) and not fish (an aquatic, anamniotic, gill-bearing vertebrate animal). I am against the trend to see fatness as something good and positive, I simply use the my professor in the human physiology method to understand why someone has wrong conclusion from the facts."
"Are you switching pronouns on purpose? Sometimes you call her a she sometimes its a he? Also, isnt his name Asher not Ashmeer? I agree with your video, but why go after the fact theyre trans ot get their name wrong? I don't understand?"
"Loves fat trans people and hates old people. Yeah, these 2 groups will never coexist because morbidly obese trans people tend to die young."
"I gained a lot of weight going through peri-menopause.  I had a lot of issues during this 9.5 year time frame.  Gained 50+ lbs in about 2 weeks.  Just popped up one day.  I didn't start losing weight until I was put as Menopaused.  I dropped 20 lbs in one month.  This stuff is serious and can cause one to be diabetic, heart diseased and other stuff.  I was insulted by a doctor (GYN) to get gastric bypass surgery.  I will NOT go through that.  She never looked at my hormone levels and did not offer any other help.  I did not see a GYN for close to 10 years.  She was the worst.  Very insenstive.  However, I tried, but the hormones were so wacked out (worse that what I experienced during pueberty).  My blood sugers are down to pre-diabetic levels after 13 years.  I'm wanting off medicines and don't want to be a slave to them."
💩
"Obese is a medical term there is nothing wrong with it. My doctors told me all the time that I was medically obese when I was around 250 lbs to 260 lbs. Yeah not massively obese but still obese because of my height.<br><br>The doctor doesn't hate you for telling you this. Because he is taught in school the correct term. Or would you like if doctors go ""Hey you fat f**k !"" that I hear during my youth?<br><br>Fasting glucose showing you are diabetic is real it is not fake.<br>Knee joints that literally creak and ache is real and not fake.<br>High blood pressure, causing migrane is real and not fake.<br>Sleep apnea, literally suffocating to death in your sleep is also real and not fake. <br><br>It took me years to bring down my HbA1C to 5.4% and cholesterol to 229 mg/dl. <br>It was all worth it."
"They need to know your weight so they can prescribe the correct amount of medicine. And if being fat is fine, why are so many body positivity influencers dying so young?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=513"">08:33</a> what is scary is how many people liked his assinine comment!"
Sorry - “he”? Really?
Yes it does. Being fat is unhealthy period or has been proven beyond and doubt that being obuse is not good
Ooof. She gross…..
"2 delusions in 1. Once you start believing you are born in the “wrong body”, then what stops you from believing in other nonsense!"
I really be sitting here watching your doll. And I’m entertained 😂🫶🏽 you’re changing me omg
"My doctor isn't afraid to tell me when I need to lose weight and I'm thankful.<br>I lost 80 lbs as a teenager (he's been our family doctor since I was maybe 6?) and he had lots of questions to make sure it was done safely. And it was, thankfully.<br>My mom too, was never afraid to caution me if I was losing track. Not in a mean or derogatory manner, simply out of love and care.<br>I was blessed to have such people."
Beens and rice is good for you
"i don't understand how all these fat influencers ALL just happen to have diabetes, mobility issues, or disabilities that are completely unrelated to their diet and size.  what a crazy coincidence"
"If you’re going to pretend that she isn’t a woman, can you at least stick to one set of incorrect pronouns? Switching between referring to her as a man and as multiple people in the same sentence is just confusing."
Conciquences!
"Haha this ""it's a genetics thing"" always cracks me up. I guess everyone who had been to death camps or people starving in third world countries have just unlucky genetics, too bad"
"You keep saying HE. You Keep Using That Word, I Do Not Think It Means What You Think It Means. If that is a he, I am a Yorkshire Terrier."
"I am SO damn tired of people claiming that fatphobia is racist. The implication that black people are just naturally fat is racist. These people see that a lot of black people are fat and don't consider that there's a regional culture reason for that and not a genetic one. <br><br>People who live in tribes in Africa, like the Himba, eat diets rich in protein and don't eat processed foods and sugars. They are constantly moving and are all at a very healthy weight. There may be SOME black communities where fatness is equated to beauty, but that's not a rule across the board. <br><br>Black people aren't ""just naturally fatter,"" and the insistance that that's the case and therefore fatphobia is racis IS what's actually racist."
"That’s not a dude though, that’s a chick right? I can’t tell who is who in the story with the nonsense pronoun use<br>But if that chick is the “Dr.” then why would it shock anyone someone confused by a mirror would reject the reality of health?"
"I work in public health so I know lots of homeless people and drug users and the sheer amount of negligence and abuse they experience from <b>doctors</b> and <b>nurses</b> - really just any hospital staff is horrific. From refusing to treat patients, to denying them any medication, not letting a person even rest in the waiting room despite bleeding profusely from the head. The worst was a client who had no legs and was carried out and abandoned in the snow with no wheelchair and only wearing a t-shirt. <b>That</b> is true medical trauma and abuse, not being told that you need to lose a little weight."
I can't believe the trenchpool got her  doctorate after matilda
I’ve kept 50 lbs off for forty years. My back hasn’t gone “out” since.
💩
I'm a busy mom and while I clean the kitchen I listen to your videos and it truly does save me from scrolling and reading haha. I get all my drama in my earpiece while I clean haha
Came here cos of the algorithm.... Stayed for the biceps lol
The barbie version of you was well done
I get how an average person with no medical knowledge could be tricked into believing that obesity is ok. But for a doctor this requires an extra special level of delusion. I feel embarrased to be from the UK.
"I'm type 2 diabetic, after losing 50lbs my body was able to reverse the diabetes."
"(I am a physician assistant) This person should lose their license, and probably get sued to hell. There's just about a billion meta-studies and systemic reviews (the highest levels of studies possible), showing that obesity is the No 1 preventable cause of premature loss of life closely followed by nicotine abuse, in the first world. A doctor actively harming patients is like, the biggest no-no possible xD"
He?
Denying sex and claiming to be trans counts me out. I wouldn’t trust anything else this person says.
How in the world could she get a medicine degree????<br>That's just impossible in my mind.
This is my preworkout. LMAOOO. 💀
Lol he just wants to be fat😂🤣. I don't ugh. Im going to try to loose my 50 pounds.
I have been a type 2 since I was a little kid. I wasn't overweight when I was younger but then I start gaining weight around 10. Now I have to get rid of these 50 pounds😅 at 35.
The fat is affecting this unDoctor Brain
"So this person went through four years of undergrad, took the bitch of a test that is the MCAT and went through the arduous medical school admissions process, got in and did 4 years of med school, did a residency, all to peddle this nonsense and lose their license? Talk about a massive waste of time and money"
"When I go for my annual checkup, the first thing my doctor’s assistant does is take my blood pressure and weigh me.  That’s SOP for a visit.  If these women are so in love with their fat bodies, why are they so triggered by having to step on a scale?"
🤔 if this person is so convinced fat people are healthy. Then they should lose weight and document how they start feeling. Just watch their mood be like I feel better about myself.
"We really need to stop promoting self love and start promoting self-respect. Self love allows you to treat yourself go on vacations pamper yourself get that extra donut or hot Cheetos or whatever because you love yourself and you should spoil who you are. Self-respect is greater than self-love because you respect yourself enough to go to the gym you respect yourself enough to eat healthy and that is actually real love. Self-respect sometimes requires us to do things we don’t wanna do, but we respect ourselves enough to do those things where our self love allows us to stay in a level of comfort and disillusioned."
💩
How much money is that person making from the food industry?<br>I have lost 60-90 pounds 3 times in my life. I know I feel a lot better at 220 than I do at 290 and have a hard time wiping my butt.<br>If that person lost weight they would be happier. 🤠
"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 No cure for being obese! They how did I loose 50lbs when i changed my diet and exercised then. Must have been the imaculate deletion! Ahhh, fat doctors are just not smart. If there is no such thing as being a fat so* o* a bit** then I am going to enter the Ms. USA pageant. Im 7 months pregnant but since there is not such thing as fat. Well ima gonna go eat some serious shi*. Now that i cant gain weight. Thanks doc i have never been given such a Fuc*** awsome excuse to eat! Worst comes to worse and you are bat shi* craz* then i got ozempic🎉🎉🎉. So im good yall!!!! Yea Yah!!!!"
"Not gonna lie, you calling that woman 'he' confused me quite a bit. This is clearly why this whole pronouns bullshit is bullshit cuz now we are all confused."
💩
"Holy shit, good for Tammy! I'm so happy for her!❤"
Anyone notice how everytime the Fat doctor says anything he never explains his point he just says something isn't true and moves on. ie Zero Evidence
"They will not be missed, as they say good riddance to bad rubbish."
I love Dr Idz...a voice of sanity on TikTok.
Its like Homer when they tried to make him exercise at work. Imagine being that afraid of losing some weight holy shit!
that doctor is too old irrelevant for her to bother.... but then she did then bother by commenting on his post.  This is the same lack of logic she applies to her medical practice.
“Listen to what your body tells you” <br><br>Alcoholic: I’m sober for 2 yrs now<br><br>Body: Let’s go get a drink <br><br>Alcoholic: But we don’t have self control <br><br>Body:yeah but you need to listen to me I know what’s best
I can ask a nearby company to use their pallet scale 🙂 and a forklift truck. But for an American 🤔 there is a truck weighing 'bridge' down the road and a railcar scale over there <points>
"i don't understand these people. trying to forbid words won't stop you from tilting an yacht when you walk around, or breaking chairs, or clogging the entrance to a bus. no matter what you call it, fat is fat."
"I understand hating the term ""obesity"" as far as there's a lot of shit Doctors used to say that are common insults now. Retard is a prime example. I genuinely wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the medical terms today are blacklisted from our vocabulary in 100 years. It's not the words that are bad, it's just how we use them, and no word is safe from being used as a pejorative."
This mini-verse is the thing we never knew we needed. Love.
"Jesus, I'm on ozempic, but if people think you don't have to do anything... what a waste. A waste of money, and time. You should change your diet, regardless. And exercise as much as you can. Like start slow, go for walks.... man, people who think its a freaking cheat code... so sadly mistaken."
💩
The simplest counter to anyone who says being fat is healthy: “where are all the fat old people?”
Fat people in denial to this extreme is almost kind of funny.
"Im currently prediabetic at 26. Weight is around 160-170 at 5""5. Im no obese ore considered overweight but still im prediabetic. Ive been going through alot the last 2 years and im also on antidepressants. I dont understand how obese people live like this and dont feel any guilt or shame. Im currently trying to shrink my stomach so i stop over eating by having smaller portions of food and eating less meals every day. And taking long walks so my body gets used to being on the move before i go back to the gym."
He my arse! She’s insane!
"Looks like the fat doctor was a failing doctor anyway and was not making any considerable amount of money, and that's why they decided to hop on the fat acceptance trend and did not giva a f**k about loosing their medical licence."
"You're so funny. 😂 I love your silly but REALLY searious videos.<br>People should stop eat so much  processed food, seems to really damage their brains and make them stupid. I'm in shock of all the stupidity nowdays...."
"""I don't have a brain, I'm plastic."" lmao"
"Between March and September of 2023 I lost about 30 pounds. So far I've kept most of it off, and am starting again, hoping for another 15 to 20 down by the end of this year. The final kick for me to do it was my idiot (now ex-) ortho telling me that the only problem with my knee was that I'm fat and lazy. So I lost the weight, started walking and doing exercise classes, lost almost half the weight I'd ideally like to lose, feel better in a lot of ways, but the knee? It hurts worse. So I've got a new guy, and we're trying to decide if it's bad enough yet to get it replaced. Spite is a powerful motivator, and I was determined to prove that first doc wrong, that I could lose the weight, and the exercise or lack therof wasn't the primary problem my knee was having. I feel good having proved both. <br><br>The next goal is to fit into a favorite dress I haven't been able to wear in about 15 years. <br><br>The worst part is knowing that in spite of the fact that I should lose at least another 40 pounds, I'm still pretty slender compared to a significant portion of the general population. At 5'5.5"" and 185 pounds I shouldn't be able to walk down a street or go through a mall and see so many people who make me feel svelte."
My final question of the day remains: Why does Lizzo think slapping herself across the belly means loving yourself? It's literally what I started doing when I was trying to find an alternative to c*tting myself. Slapping myself all over until my whole body stung.<br>Does she not have the power to bitch slap or is she simply masochistic? That's what I'd like to know.
"I’m not a doctor, but I am in school to be a surgical tech. I’ve seen the insides of people in the shadow and clinical work I’ve done. There’s totally fat around the organs lol. To deny that so proudly is insane."
"Also, I doubt many people would be bragging online that their wife lost weight after taking Ozempic, considering that means you are leaving evidence online of having acquired medication with likely illegal means as it sounds like she wasn't prescribed them. Who would ever be stupid enough to confess to something illegal when you don't know who can trace those comments back to you? Considering some employers even go as far as checking their employees TikTok account, someone you know might see it and get you in trouble for it if they held a strong stance on illegal drugs/medication."
"They are so irresponsible, I have to wonder if they even went to a medical school, because their rhetoric puts <i>human lives</i> at risk. And they don't care."
"Showing a mini version of Goosebumps is legends behavior. As a 26 year old, I loved how I got to be in the final years of that era. Like in The Netherlands this era includes a horror society of children literature writers and some of the writers like the late Eddie C Bertin eventually stopped printing their children's horror works so kids even a few years younger then me missed out. To this day I want to petition to his relatives if I can translate the Valentina series along with a copy of the final book because its such a rare gem in second-hand stores. He was primarily an adult horror author and it showed in the maturity levels as well as the fact it goes against children's commercial writing as spoiler alert but the heroine, Valentina, dies at the end of the series (which is supposed to be a huge no-no in children's books) and the story ends with her best friend visiting her grave and context: he messed around with magic in book 5 as he's looking for a love spell to cast on Valentina and it ends up going apocalyptically wrong. And the biggest tragedy of it all was that Valentina was beginning to return his feelings because he always had her back when fighting the occult even after they killed her mom and he would have gotten together with her if he hadn't made that stupid and toxic decision typical of an impatient 14 year old. It low-key ages so well precisely because as an adult you can see how well horror 'movie'  logic and the many stupid actions of the characters go well with the gripes of being an annoying or insecure teenager and how dark forces are preying on those and their naivety to get what they want. Like, its a whole lot less dumb and contrived to have 14 year olds fall into the trap of a monster then a grown adult who should have seen the red flags. If I could, I'd honestly recommend it to anyone who still loves their old Goosebumps novels and people who like horror centering children precisely because of their young mindset like the It movies did (the book shall not be named. I will forever be cautious around Stephen King after THAT scene)"
"After two decades of feels before reals, we need to bring back personal accountability and shame for wilful ignorance."
Cigarette smokers have to deal with these doctors too. There's no way smoking might make me have medical conditions.
Fat doctor uses he/they pronouns for all those making comments that want to use the correct pronouns.
"im supposed to call this obvious woman with a side ponytale breasts and make up on and a womans voice ""he""?.....k"
Your first mistake is taking any health advice from a fat person.That's a big red flag.
I was confused at first because you said man and I thought you was on about the asian guy but this video is about the woman pretending to be a man pretending that fat is not harmful. Ok I get it now.
It's really a f**ked up world we live in.
"Omfg you pulled a Thanos on the fat doctor and was like ok ima 1up you......""Now Reality can be whatever I want!"" Lmao Rofl"
Just because you're fat doesn't mean you're unhealthy and lazy!!!  <br>Well I'm slim 79 and walking several miles every day I meet many others out walking too and none of them are fat but I see fat people struggling to breathe after the slightest exertion like boarding a bus or train then they collapse into a seat usually in a ball of sweat. Fat people are lazy and unhealthy
Why are so many fat people in denial
I’m not trying to be offensive but I’m noticing a trend. A lot of these fat positive influencers end up transitioning? I wonder why?
"Can you stop calling her, he? Pretending to be a woman when you are a man is the same thing of saying you’re it’s not your fault when you’re 500 pounds. We need to stop with all of this delusion."
Not a he
"Good health begins with being honest with yourself. Health is not just another ""social construct""."
plastic Michelle is so cute 😍😍😍
I’m the average weight for my height (~45kg) and the doctor still makes me step on the scale. It’s not anything phobic. Just procedure. What are these people thinking ???
When these fat people yell about fat acceptance its the most cardio they’ll get all day.
💩
"I think the very first point about doctors telling people to go on a diet for anything is a real issue that happens to people. Im not saying they dont need to lose weight im not saying the doctor doesnt know what theyre talking about but the doctors that are being criticised in such videos are the ones that completely overlook someones symptoms and ignore their pain because of their weight. Fat people go in for anything and get told to lose weight. Its wrong, its unethical it SHOULD be criticised.<br><br>Secondly diabetes type 2 isnt always someones fault thats sort of an insensitive thing to say. There can be many causes and factors that put someone at a risk of getting t2d without it being their fault. The doctor telling the commentor that they shouldnt do anything to prevent diabetes despite being pre diabetic is wrong but you too shouldnt spread misinformation, considering the entire video is about the fact that the doctor is spreading misinformation"
He?
"I am technically obese as my BMI is above 30, and I can confirm I am lazy as I don't want to diet and exercise."
"Being fat isn't unhealthy, right up to the moment your arteries seize up."
"How do adipose cells (fat cells) get fat?   Excess glucose in the blood triggers an insulin response.  Insulin drives glucose out of the blood and into adipose cells through pores on the surface.  Inside the adipose cell, the glucose is combined with glycogen and become triglycerides.  Triglycerides are too large to pass through the pores of the adipose cells and are trapped or ""stored"" inside.  The adipose cells can expand to accommodate an almost unlimited number of triglycerides.  The ""craving"" experienced after eating too many carbohydrates that become glucose in the blood, is caused by the drop in glucose levels due to the insulin response. This sets up a continuous cycle of craving, eating, spiking, insulin release, crashing.  If left unchecked the result is obesity.  The problem is not fatty foods, not inactivity nor calories,  it is a carbohydrate rich diet.  This is why diets like the carnivore diet work so well.  There are no carbohydrates at all.  Without glucose in the blood, another reaction takes place.  Your body breaks down triglycerides into ketones and your body functions perfectly well using up all that energy stored inside your adipose cells.  This is biology, folks!"
Love the Michelleverse ❤
Why do you keep referring to it as he?
"That's a woman, pretending to be a man."

The claims of racism stifle the recognition of genetic differences both between populations and individuals that lead to different risk of various conditions. And the unfortunate thing is many of the people who would benefit the most are the most vocal in whining about racism
"I was obese, and type II diabetic. I am now only slightly overweight. I'm still diabetic. The tendency is genetic. I was able to get off insulin and some oral meds, but am still on others. My BMI has gone from 39 to 25. I am also pretty active and walk around 10 mile over the course of each week."
"Here is the problem, the body positivity movement went from the benevolent concept of ""you don't have to feel bad about yourself, or accept bad treatment, because you're big"" to the outright ridiculous concept of ""if you give me objectively factual medical advice that would suggest that my weight is going to cause health problems, you're fatphobic."" It's insane!"
"Did y’all know when she says subscribe, the button flashes"
As a brit i would like to apologise for this...erm.... thing. Not all brits are this f*cking stupid
I see you're also confused about fat doctor's gender.
"Why do you keep calling this strange woman ""him"""
The Barbie thing is so cute lol. Obsessed.
this video is better without the inconsistency in gendered language
"I can't wait for ozempic stuff to have its patent expired so it can go generic, thats like 15 years or so from now though I believe"

Very funny!
"Of course, the Fat Doctor UK is now a  transman.  Who could have guessed this new development?<br> But they need to stay «relevant», especially as they can no longer practice medicine.<br><br>If I told my patients with Type I diabetes to just stop using their insulin, I would lose my license, too."
What less is only dangerous when it's take me to an extreme like starving yourself or anorexia and bulimia but weight loss done right it's not dangerous

"The largest causal factor in gaining weight? Say it with me folks, O V E R I N D U L G E N C E.<br>I do it too. Everyone does it occassionally. Impulse ice cream is sometimes the most tasty. But i dont eat it every month. My mealtime kryptonite is pizza. I love pizza. I eat far too much pizza. And i am too fat. Do i want to have a smaller body though? Quite the opposite.<br><br>I WANT A LARGER BODY THAT WOULD MAKE STATUES IN ROME WEEP OPENLY AT MY PASSING FOR WITNESSING THE MAJESTY OF MY MUSCLES! I WANT TO WALK INTO A GYM AND HEAR GRAVITY ITSELF SIGH THAT A DUEL IS ONCE AGAIN UPON THEM! Its just... starting feels like such a chore..."
The reason people like FatnolongerDrUK exist is because now everyone with enough followers has a platform and it gives you more money and views to sprrad misinformation than to be a doctor.
It's also scientifically proven that obesity shrinks your brain.  Ops...
Any Dr who prompts an  agenda should have his or her  license revoked
"I had an issue. It wasn't around food, it was around soda. I drank way too much. Developed type 2 diabetes, and only knew after one of my toes got infected.<br><br>I'm no longer type 2 diabetic and I feel way better. I'm not tired all the time, I have way more energy, and I look better. All in my own opinion, if course. <br><br>I still have my toe, and I've cut all sugary drinks from my diet. That was 90% of my sugar intake. Now I'll have like half a Twix a week to curb any craving for sugar. I replaced the soda with flavored sparkling water and water.<br><br>I didn't accept my weight, but I didn't want to stop. That's something that's easy to acknowledge  especially after I examined my eating habits. A second shifter, where it was just easier to get McDonald's right before work and on the way home. That's two large sodas. Add in at least one 20 oz at work from the vending machine. <br><br>What made it worse was when I got my own house. I kicked it into overdrive. It was a bad craving, and I couldn't stop. Stopped real fast in the hospital, but a week before when I first found out, I dumped all the sugary drinks down the sink. It sucked, but I had to remove the temptation to go back.<br><br>I'm now 60 pounds lighter and feel fantastic. I take two walks a day to touch some grass. I'm looking into getting some weights, so that I can alternate. Walk one day, so arm exercises the next."
"You can't reverse it, once you have type 2 diabetes you will always have type 2 diabetes, excess sugar will always be a threat to you. The good news is that excess sugar is under your control. You can get addicted to sugar, no sorry, you can get addicted to the taste of sweet so artificial sweeteners can contribute to your addiction. If you are addicted your mind will insist you are hungry which can turn the difficult task of losing weight into an impossible task. The good news is that once you get your addiction under control you can now satisfy your body with a healthier diet and exercise and weight loss now becomes easy. The sad news is that while new damage from excess sugar can be stopped much of the damage already done may be irreversible. This takes not a diet but a drastic change in your diet every day. The real secret is not to go hungry and not to eat foods you don't like but to eat the healthiest foods you find acceptable. The sooner you get your type 2 diabetes under control the better the outlook. I was borderline morbidly obese and suffering from many of the health issues that come with type 2 diabetes. I am in my 8th year of having my blood sugar under control. Life is better."
"Omg i just noticed, I've never had an big doctor lol. All my doctors have never been like, unhealthy looking."

"Any social  media influencer using their platform to promote obesity need to be banned. They are threwat to public health.  Obesity is everyday becoming a global problem. Obesity,  is  a far bigger issue than influencers, but we need to tackle everything  , influencers, irresponsible food industry and the current work culture."
"This makes me beyond angry!!! Having this former “health care” professional is everything wrong with “body positivity”. As a former fat person, I made out in the effort and hard work decades ago and continue to lead a healthy lifestyle. As all of us age, it is how YOU make the decision to maintain proper diet and exercise for a quality of life. Exercise can be going for a walk, light weight training, swimming, yoga…..I’m not saying spend hours in the gym but do something!!! Trust me you will be better for it."
"Dr Natasha Larmie chose not to attend the General Medical Council hearing, which was for publicly saying she hates White men—not trying to accelerate people’s demise.<br>They gave her a formal warning for deviating from professional standards. They said her conduct didn’t “justify her patients’ trust in her and the public’s trust in the profession,” but doesn’t “pose a risk to public protection.”"
Modern Left: You must accept the science about COVID and climate change or you are a racist sexist homophobe! Also Modern Left: You are a racist sexist homophobe if you accept the science of biology and medicine!
"I do think environments contribute to obesity. Obesogenic environments where fruit and veg are hard to come buy, jink food is in abundance, there aren't footpaths to go walking, it's the social norm go out and eat all the time, working hours are.long, jobs are sedentary and sports clubs are expensive or hard to come by make healthy choices harder. Obesity is more prevalent amongst poorer people in developed countries and wealthy people in developing countries"

"I wouldn’t even be able to take ozempic , I’d eat all the way through it , “appetite suppressant “ nah that won’t work and I know it 😭"
I’ve always know fat around organs are real cause of biology and being taught that but I also recently had a placement in theatres where I saw a lap appendix in a teen and a lap orchidopexy in a few months old there was noticeable difference in the fat around the organs depending on how old they are and how much fat they would have consumed by that time. It was such a weird thing to see cause I’d now it was real but obviously had never actually seen it around organs and now I just wish I could see what mine look like cause I’ve obviously consumed fat in my life and now I’m just curious to what my organs look like.
I dare any obese person who claims theyre just as healthy and fit at that size to come for a run with me.
Go to the doctor as a future diabetic is the right term.
This doctor probably thinks humans can become the opposite sex as well.
He is a she right?
Her sarcastic Barbie reminds me of Most Popular Girls School lmao. 😂<br>Solid vid as usual!
What is this thing apart from confused? She he they? What? Confused.
"i don´t like being fat.... lets get rid of the word ""fat""... very powerful Logic ^^"
Omg Michelleverse is so cool!
He or she?
I'd rather listen to an old doctor than an obese doctor.
"i'm so confused, is the fat doctor a girl, a man or a they? you called her all 3 throughout the whole video. i was so lost who you was talking about the entire video because you also showed other faces/videos. 😅"
all that work down the drain.
"honestly it took my gyno to realize that i needed to see a specialist while my primary doctor pushed aside my test results, my severe weight loss (i had lost over 80lbs in almost 6 months making me underweight but it also had to do with the meds i was on at the time) and then my very fast weight gain. by very fast i mean i put on almost 100lbs in less than 6 months due to a thyroid issue (which was only found out after i got a referral from my gyno as my primary just kept looking at my chart and didnt care about the very sudden weight gain) <br>i barely trust them now and dont want to go back but have no other choice."

"Type 2, former fat man. diagnosed at 30! 13 years later, other than diabetes, I'm in the best shape of my life.  I've lost 120lbs, quit smoking, I have a full range of dumbbells, barbell plates, benches, racks, exercise bike (all of which I actually use).  I follow a structured diet (gotta cheat sometimes) and I've never felt better or looked better in my life.  It was the biggest wakeup call of my life and I have zero doubt if I hadn't changed my lifestyle completely I'd be dead by now."
Sure I hate having to get on the scale at the doctor office I hate being considered obese even tho I'm 165 pounds but guess what thats how things are. I lost 35 pounds last year did I gain 10 pounds back sure but a bitch is on vacation 😅 this whole boycotting these words is insane and ridiculous.
"That's a woman, man!"
"800 calories a day, with at least two hours of hard exercise. Or you can just go ahead and die. Which is your choice?"
He is a truly a very big quack
I could break down with the email that he got basically is stating that they do not find him mentally fit and they are requiring him to provide evaluation proof that you are mentally sound and fit. That’s what they’re asking that email.
"I do not know the UK board, but I could tell you this if he wasn’t in the United States I know for sure to Texas board definitely revoke his license here because he breaks every medical code"
"I wish I found this individual long time and if he said that I’m going to spend the rest of my life fighting it, I would reply back. I’m very proud of you that you are not a quitter you’re out for a long fight, but you’re gonna do that without your license"
"Oh God, yeah he deserved to get his license revoked pre-diabetes is not diabetes. Yeah it is the early stages of it. What I like to call it the warning signs basically you’re at the point of no return, but you can turn back."
"Oh God, yeah he deserved to get his license revoked pre-diabetes is not diabetes. Yeah it is the early stages of it. What I like to call it the warning signs basically you’re at the point of no return, but you can turn back."
Being fat is true it’s not a disease. It’s a disorder and what’s a disorder a disease.
I agree I seen two doctors that went to school with what’s funny is this I graduated second in my class. They graduate first year and a lost there license within 10 years. from the board I’m still successful. I cannot to School by legal issues. Why they lost her license just really bad how they lost it.
"Being told you’re obese hurts yeah. But instead of leading a parade to criminalize the word as a derogatory term (it’s literally a medical term), use it as a push to better yourself and your body. Jeezus the human race is fucked if people like this win"
"Until I had my first child I was 119lbs and never moved from this by more than a lb or 2, no matter what I ate. By the time I'd had my 3rd I had ballooned to 245lbs, it took about 18months of hard work and I got back down to 154lbs. I'm relatively happy with that we I won't ever get back to 119lbs not that I'd want to, that's just to skinny."
"Them: my knees hurt, I should go to the doctor.<br>Doctor: your knees hurt because you're overweight.  Lose weight.<br>Them: hOw DaRe YoU!!"
being over weight can cause health problems
"well my fat belly was caused of me eating too fucking much and at the wrong time. I cut that out, lost weight, start lifting some weights, and puff... I am back in shape. Sure now need new pants and T-shirts, and It is really annoying, but look at that my genetic had nothing to do with. I was making fun of fat losers when i was in shape, continued when I was fat, and I am not going to stop when I got in shape again,"
"We call it morbid obesity. If theres no medical reason, lose weight. Otherwise there are consequences."
As an L in the LGBT... I'm ashamed people like this are associated w us. The reality denial is too real.
"Okay, let's stop using the word obese. I agree. Let's revert back to how we called it in the good old days: FAT."
How did this person even become a doctor dear lord…
This GUY is delusional
"There seems to be some confusion about this (former) doctor. She is a transman and weighty human.

"Wow. Before my rny gastric bypass I remember feeling like I couldn't expand my lungs very far. Lost 70kg in a year, doubled my lung capacity. I think organ fat - massively documented - is a thing ma'am. Sorry."
"See, these terms can also just be thrown around. Im in Canada, so I'm not sure how different here than elsewhere. However, Im all muscle from gym and a physical job. Yet im technically ""overweight."" I should be 120lbs im 140lbs of pure muscle. So it really depends on body types. Muscle weighs more than fat. You would also need weight for meds..... so yes, a scale is needed!"

"You know that medical board was throwing a party after that response of many laughing emojis, because now they don't have to go through a bs trial about how they fired someone for wrongful discrimination, now they can wash their hands completely of the windbag and move on with life, done them a favor."
They really be putting any o'l random thang in important job positions aren't they? Just identify as something special and boom you're an expert (or an activist pretending to be an expert). It's no wonder the gaming and movie industries are falling harder than a 50lb 2 year old who haven't learned how to walk yet.... At least the medical field don't allow their crackpots to flourish turning their industry into a regressive cultish joke. Gaming corporations and Hollyweird could learn a thing or 2 from the medical industry.
That shorter haircut makes her head look like a big toe.
Ok then.....
"if you're scared to see your own weight on a scale, you're the one who has a problem with your own weight. doctors record weight at each visit so that they can track unusual weight loss or gain. if you go to your doctor one week and then the hospital the next, and they weigh you at both visits and you've lost 10 pounds in between visits - something is not right, for most people. weight loss is one of the first signs of cancer that people may notice in their daily lives. sudden weight loss is also a sign of untreated diabetes, which is deadly. this is the reason your doctor weighs you at appointments, and during hospital visits. it has nothing to do with your feelings."
"Well congratulations sinking all that money you paid for medical school, down the toilet! Also, for someone who’s apparently so “passionate about changing an oppressive field” you sure buckled like a Jenga tower at being investigated. They even gave you a chance to fight for your license! But whatever, at least he’s not a licensed doctor anymore 🤣"
idk intentional weight loss improved my health significantly so
I think she needs a 5150 (or whatever it is in the UK).
"There use of phobia needs to stop being used for everything people didn't agree with, I'm not scared of fat people i just it kind of sad that they're too lazy to workout or lack the self discipline to eat healthy"
"There's something heinous about getting being a licensed doctor just to lie to people about health and not losing weight. What is there to even gain from that? You're knowingly encouraging the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands of people! Absolutely sick"
Never trust a doctor who looks like that.
"If being overweight has nothing to do with diet like these “Fat Acceptance Advocates” claim, why do they get mad when someone goes on a diet?"
I’ve seen the new Southpark movies lmao they threw so much shade 😂😂

"I was a mid-level and learned that there are 2 types of clinicians: one type, who understands that their license allows them the duty of practicing medicine, and the other who believes their license is actually a license to dictate reality and make things up. <br><br>The latter is far more common than most would like."
just by looking at her i can tell she is in the woke cult

"Just how did this freak gain a medical license in the first place? One thing’s for certain.  she could only ever practice, practice, practice ~ because she certainly wasn’t getting anything right. Of course, there’s the old saying, ‘practice makes perfect’ but she seems to have totally failed in that regard. <br>I wonder if any of her victims ~ whoops, sorry I meant patients ~ are in a position to sue for malpractice, having followed the clearly demented advice and suffered a bad outcome because of it? After all, she was charging £200 ($253 USD) per 60-90 minute virtual consultation as a ‘weight inclusive’ health coach(!) so I bet the ‘advice’ given was anything but healthy. That’s on top of her regular salary. An average NHS GP salary in the U.K. is £87,884 ($111,300 USD) There’s no set pay scale for GPs in the UK, the salary reflecting the individual’s years of experience, level of responsibility (irresponsibility in her case), qualifications, and which UK nation they are working in. <br>At least now her license has been pulled, the level of medical competence in the U.K. has increased. Do I think she’ll ever get her license returned? <br>Fat chance….."
"Absolutely agree, I Iive in Thailand and the food temptations are everywhere. Anything you can imagine and much more is here and it's all really good. But I've managed to lose 25 lbs over a couple years by sacrificing, pain (jogging) and will power. I love Thai fried chicken (10x better than KFC) but I dont touch it or any fried food. It hurts not to be able to scarf at will but it feels worse having a gut hanging over my pants. Other give-ups: Indian food, Mex food, Pasta. Maybe occassionally, but staying out of the hospital is higher priority than binging munch-gasms. BTW, hilarious dialogue and brilliant concept--10/10 for you. Comedy gold right here"

Losing weight causes problems?
Fat acceptance is literally the dumbest things iver ever come across.
"Listen, medication, genetics and underlying conditions will absolutely play a role in weight management. But stating that diet wont impact your weight is just wrong. How can anyone claim otherwise? And i say this as a obese person. Im obese because of medication and underlying conditions. But hey, I also didnt eat right during that time where i gained weight. If i had, my weight gain wohldnt have been so drastic"
"I'm just saying, I had some friends who I grew up with who were obese, and none of them lived to even reach 45."
"someone PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me what the background song is at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=95"">1:35</a> !!"
"I dont think i will ever understand this 'fat positive' movement. There is nothing 'positive' about being overweight. It sucks. It's expensive. It's painful. It is not something to be proud of, and it is not 'beautiful'. These people are absolutely delusional to think being fat is healthy, and i genuinely feel sorry for them. The doctors that dont encourage better behaviors to lose weight/ prevent weight gain are just enablers that dont deserve their license."
"Best way to make sure you let someone know they're fat is have them go on a hike with you. Then tell them ..... Now, imagine something bad happens where you need to flee, who's gonna be victim number one? Usually fat people. I mean even someone healthy with a broken leg can move faster. If you're fat, go hit the gym, eat healthy, and lose weight. I've never heard anyone ever say they regret choosing fitness ever."
Trans doctor.... enough said
Colonist? The nhs was created after world war 2..
"It's not calories itself that causes weight gain. There is a lot more that goes into food that can affect your diet. Greasy foods and sugar are so much worse for you than other healthy alternatives. But they could have the same amount of calories.  And they're not wrong by saying that there are other ways to cause weight gain because medication, underlying conditions, and orher factors do that. What people need is a healthy balance in their life."
"""Spending the rest of my life"" well....about that"
I am obese.  I was 326 pounds.  I am now down to 275.  I plan on continuing to lose weight.  I like being a normal weight better.  I will never accept being fat.
I like your channel. Please do a video on all the fat acceptance fatties that have died from being fat.
Yeah fat around the organs nearly killed me I lost a 100 pounds over 2 years healthy weight now I’m convinced that if I didn’t do what I did when I did I would probably be on disability ( I have rare genetic disorder that effects my organs so weight gain is dangerous)
"Yeah, because obesity doesn’t hurt your joints, among other things 🙄<br>After I began losing weight, my knees felt better and I actually improved my sleep."

I have a distrust for any medicine that helps you lose weight .

Since I am smoker next time I go to the doctor I’ll say don’t you dare bring cancer that offensive to me 😂😂
"I know this is just anecdotal evidence I have to add my 2cents to that ""dr's"" comments. In Oct '23 my GP was worried about some of my health markers, advised me to make some lifestyle changes and put me on Wegovy. Feb '24 I had my followup visit and ACROSS the board, my health markers had improved DRASTICALLY! I've never seen a Dr giggle at my chart before, but he was so excited at the progress I had made."
When Malcom X warned us about how the liberal agenda was the main enemy to civil rights is this crap right here. Using racism for something u did to urself is disrespectful.
"I just don't get it.  ""Just cause you're fat doesn't mean you're lazy and unhealthy!""  That's literally, exactly what that means.  Now, I'm not going to ask ""Why don't they just stop eating so much?"" because that's like asking a drug addict ""Why don't they just stop shooting up?"" but admitting you have a problem is obviously step one, and if you're so fat you can't wipe your own ass, that should be throwing a red flag or two."
I kinda wish a psychiatrist could Analyze this person and see what’s going on in their brain.
Can she explain to me why once I list 100lbs my blood pressure dropped and I no longer needed to be on medication for it.  I also have a ton more energy and am more active now in my 40’s than I was in the last two decades.   But wait when does all this become harmful to me?
He?
mollycuddled
Thank god this piece of s*** so called doctor has his license revoked. He is a shameful excuse for a doctor and human being.
"I mean, technically they are a doctor because they have a PHD, but they ain't a medical doctor no more lmao.<br>Yeah, lots of things can cause weight gain, but a lack of self-control and motivation is indeed one of them!"
"It is not healthy to be fat. If you’re fat, what should you do? Well first of all stop gaining more. And than maybe speak to a doctor (who hasn’t gotten their license revoked)."
"If I walked into the doctor's office and he was the one who called out my name for my appointment, I would literally walk right out the door.<br>I'd rather take a doctor who was sitting there having a Jim Beam on the rocks and a cigarette than an overweight one. Especially to that level of overweight, where the chins are successive speedbumps, the arms look like they have stalactite, and the belly has a bigger apron than my cooking one.<br><br>He has bigger fat bracelets then my toddler who's supposed to be slightly chubby because he's two. His arms could literally stop him sinking, they are like floaters, so much fat"
and this is why a lot of doctors want to start refusing certain people. my idea of who to start refusing. if as soon as the person uses the word fatphobic that is the cue to tell the person in question. yeah OK i can no longer have you as my patient. you are a lawsuit against either me or the client waiting to happen. you are not going to listen to what i have to say about why you have these problems.
Are they fatfrauduk now?
Why are they so afraid of scales if theyre body positive? 🤔
I think the issue is with common sense. Becoming healthy and mindful of what you put in your body gives you a better quality of life. And your body’s response time to situations increase. To me it seems like they want people to accept their bad habits more than accepting them.

"So I was a long distance cyclist (did the trans Canada ride more than once), but I had to get some pretty serious knee surgeries done.

That coupled with medication that I had started to treat my Bipolar disorder that causes significant weight gain as a side effect I gained over 80lbs during those two years. <br><br>I was like, “it’s not my fault almost everyone would have gained weight if put in the same situation.” But after around a year post recovery from my knee surgeries I came to the conclusion that how I got to this point (and whether it was my fault or not) was kind of irrelevant. When I was trying to plan on how to improve the quality of my life and manage my various medical issues the answer was pretty clear that I had to reduce my weight, particularly for my joint issues. <br><br>Gaining the excess weight may not have been my fault but I would have been responsible for maintaining that excess weight after recovery. Now I am back on my previous weight and I am cycling again. In my opinion, and at least this was the case for myself, saying being overweight weight wasn’t my fault only accomplished making me feel like I didn’t have agency and autonomy over my life and my health. That isn’t true and we can make changes in how we live. It may not be easy and it won’t happen overnight but we absolutely can change our lifestyle and habits."
Just like psychiatrists. Claiming natural emotions to be a disease. Just to sell pills and get dangerous  people out of jail.
Okay I love the doll stop-motion stuff
My lil ham hock 😂😂😂
"Wait, is this doctor trans? You keep saying he, but they look nothing like a he. Like I want to be respectful, but its so confusing when they put no attempt into transitioning but expect people to know their pronouns. I'll call you what you want to be called, But you have to give me something to work with here, or I'm gonna make an assumption based on how you look and act. And you don't look nor act the part."
"the fact that you said ""he"" makes you respect you more."
"When a failed doctor needs a gimmick to grift money, and cheat their way to fame and attention …"
Let’s add sleep apnea to the mix. Fat deposits around the airway make it harder to breathe. There’s also the excess weight on the rib cage and abdomen making it harder to expand your lungs.

Next target should be the one in ozzie called Dr L. Bacon who also spreads misinformation

"Hello, your video style is awesome, i loved it, keep going !"
Why do you keep saying 'he'?
"I heard ""fat around organs is made up"" and like..  No. Just no. I highly encourage people who don't believe this to watch 'Obesity: The Post Mortem'. It's a good, hard reality check."
"I'm so glad her license got revoked, she's a really shitty person for spreading her dumb cult."
“There’s no cure for fatness” So just fuck all the people who put in years of hard work to improve their lives by dropping 100lbs
Are they telling the trans dr and four star officer Levine the same thing? And Col Bree fram? 🤮 these persons are not only trans and telling lies to our youth they are doing it to our dang military! 😡
"Hi Michelle, my name is Jade I'm 15 and I'm trying to start my fitness journey. I am 5'0 and currently weigh 160 and know that I am not at a healthy weight. But I don't know what would be a healthy weight at the same time. I've been told 100, 120, or 130, but I'm not really sure. Plz help (p.s. I really love your videos and look up to you a lot :)"
"Holup, that’s a him??"
The editing on this channel is  bloody amazing 🎉😂
She can still call herself a doctor as she has a Doctor's Degree.
I want to live in the Michelle verse.
"If they are trans, are they trans male or trans female? I’m so confused"
"How about you sign a waver, if you weigh 400 lbs and are convinced you are as healthy as a 180 lbs man, than you refuse Medicare/Medicaid when you develop cancer or diabetes and require tax dollars for healthcare. <br>Are you willing to bet your healthcare on it?"
When I go into my doctor after not going for a long long time. They retake my weight/measurements. It’s just standard practice so they can prescribe the right medication dose for you.
"Why are you calling this person who is obviously a woman he? Come on Michelle, don't pander to these crazies who are obviously using transgenderism for attention. Real transgender people make an effort pass as the opposite gender."
"Getting type two diabetes is not the person‘s fault many times people can get type two diabetes for other reasons other than being lazy and eating shitty for example I developed it because I had gestational diabetes. I’ve never been more than 20 pounds overweight and I didn’t eat any worse than anyone else, so you’re wrong when you say that it’s everyone who gets type 2 diabetes own fault."
"You made me gotta defend fat dummy. <br>Diet means 'what you eat'. It doesn't mean a special type of food, it isn't what you do to lose weight, it's just the food you eat regularly. When people 'go on a diet', they're 'going onto a new dietary plan' and changing the things they eat. So yes, your 'Diet' is exactly what causes you to gain weight, if it's a bad diet. <br>And, biggest benefit of the doubt possible, Exercise might mean 'a lack thereof' in the specific context of that tweet."
"I can't believe they said visceral fat is made up.<br>I study veterinary medicine and literally yesterday I saw the intestines of a horse and they had visceral fat on it's sides.<br>A HORSE, which eats grass all day. How do they believe that their hot cheetos' fanatic a$$ is not gonna accumulate fat?"
This seems like a psychotic break
The delusion is absolutely insane
I love the Michelleverse!!!!
Not a he
She.
maybe it's because I'm a type1 diabetic but when my BG is high the last thing I want to do is eat it just makes me feel nauseous I just assumed it was the same for everyone I guess not tho
"Wow... That must have been a lot of work, editing the Barbie Michelle. Well done! Great video 😂❤"
"My right knee joint hurts constantly and as soon as I'm over 60 kg, it gets much much worse. I'm bounded to keep my weight under 60 kg if I want to be active. <br><br>How can people trust the judgement of someone that denies its own biological reality? I don't get it."
"Type two diabetes and pre-diabetes are often ""not your fault."" My whole family has insulin intolerance, and we fight every day to do all the things right. Weight training, clean whole foods, no sugar, low carb, lean meats, healthy fats, well balanced, and yet it's still a problem. Some people just won the genetic lottery of crap. However, we all feel 100% better doing all this hard work. It's still like swimming through molasses, so many of us end up on diabetes medication to help maintain all that hard work. If I look at a fast food restaurant, I bloat up, so yeah.....context matters, but you're right about most of it."

That is not a he.. lol
"Ive had 3 family members die from type 2 diabetes. It is VERY much their fault, and its very much avoidable. Thats insane. Absolutely insane to say type 2 diabetes isnt caused by their actions, and that its not a threat to someones life."
"I just had my first apt with a weightloss dr, and it went great😂 it ended up taking an hour and 20min, and i left feeling so good about myself and the future🤷‍♀️ ive never had a dr tell me to lose weight when it wouldnt positively impact my situation. Drs just want to help usually.<br>Also, my weightloss dr actually didnt prescribe me any medication. I brought up my options, but i lost 16lbs between my referral to the weightloss dr, and seeing her the first time, so she thought i was doing a really good job already, and i dont need meds. We talked about my exercise routines and whats best for me, we talked about my diet, and we talked about my physical and mental hurdles. She spent MAYBE 2 minutes talking about my medicine options."
the pronoun changes on that doctor are confusing me. you went through all of them
"""my shoe came off"""
"Doctors just don't weigh you to make you feel bad, they have to measure how much of a dosage to prescribe according to your body weight. (Please correct me if i am wrong)"
"I understand you're probably scared of getting cancelled, but it's so jarring hearing you refer to this awful woman as He."
"Ive been a type 1 diabetic for almost 18 years. I know a lot about it, but also about type 2. Just cause someine has type 2 diabetes does not always mean they inherently caused it. Excess weight does impact the likelihood of developing it, but its not even a main factor. The biggest factor is genetics. Ive met type 2 diabetics who were very healthy and fat people who werent diabetic. If someone is genetically predisposed to develope it, being overweight doesnt help. But please do not claim any diabetic brought it on themselves. Its medically inaccurate, spreads stigma about an already stigmatized disease, and shames those suffering with it. Also, Michelle for the rate that you talk about diabetes people might start assuming your an endocrinologist. I can barely watch your content because half your videos are just spreading misinformation about diabetes"
"I love dr Idz ""time for school. School dismissed"""
By his logic I can lose weight by going into an openair hot tub in the Alps without my mental health medication and eating a vanilla slice.
"As soon as it was mentioned to ""fix racism, sexism, fatphobia and transphobia"" in the email response, you can tell this ""doctor"" was intoxicated by Twitter. Usually people in the medical field don't take too much interest in these"
"lol “I don’t even have a brain, I’m plastic!”"
Lose weight.
"Topics like this are difficult to unpack. It’s true that a good chunk of, at least the US healthcare system, that is outdated and a majority of doctors tend to blame most women’s issues on their weight. It can be extremely frustrating trying to get a diagnosis when doctors aren’t even taking the time to run proper tests. Just like with toxic diet culture, a good thing, like body positivity, can turn sour when people start using it to justify their personal opinions and vices."
These videos are very helpful in helping me to stick to my diet.
Loved this format of michelleverse
Of course this person is trans.....
<i>He</i> is deluded about basic biology and reality?<br><br>Well well.<br><br>Well well well.
"Obviously if you have chronic pain losing weight is going to help, because your body will be under less stress. These people are extremely dumb"
If they truly believe that their ideology was correct then they would have never left. They would've stood 10 toes in their shit even at the threat of being investigated 😂
The michelleverse segment is hilarious. Im a semi new carnivore and i love this channel. We need to figure out how to bolster dietary health in our community whether vegan or carnivore.
"Facts over feelings buttercup, real life is hard and yes it can sometimes suck you don't like the truth. That's why you bury your head in the sand. <br><br>These doctors promoting body positivity even on the obese side should have their license taken away for misinformation that can leave others to think they're okay by continuing on with seriously bad choices which will lead to death."
"I understand the issues larger people have with the medical establishment (I myself am very slender but most of my family is heavier)<br>there is a genuine issue with people like that going to the doctor (especially while in the process of getting their weight under control) and having obvious health concerns overlooked because ""just lose weight"" (my partner's aunt has serious thyroid problems that have led to her excessive weight gain far beyond her control, yet when she goes to have it looked at to potentially help the problem and help her LOSE weight shes ignored or disregarded, its honestly quite angering)<br><br>but theres a huge difference between the actual problems larger people face in getting medical treatment, and disregarding genuine health advice and research because it hurts your feelings"
"my best friend is a type 2 diabetic (technically not yet cause my man has kept the diabetese in check!!)<br>hes on the larger side naturally like his parents and hasnt been on any weight loss regimen or anything, but he IS on a diet to watch how much sugar and carbs he eats (hes still alowed to have sugary things just less and watches how much he has)<br>using type 2 diabetese as a gatcha just makes you look lazy, like wow susan, you cant even put down the starbucks coffee for one day? no wonder you've got diabetese"
Choose your suffering: <br>Either diet and exercise <br>OR<br>Listen to lizzo.<br>Choose wisely. Suffering is a part of life. There's no avoiding it.
As someone whose ancestors were colonized… I don’t think feel comfortable with this person looping loosing their license into the plight of post-colonial peoples. I’m not sure they know what colonization means beyond use as a buzzword.
I dont even have words for this bullshit anymore..
These whole movement is just another form of Darwinism. These people are killing themselves plain and simple. It sad and sickening.
He!? lol!

Fk that guy 🤬"
And you keep calling this woman a he so I’m guessing they identify as a man or something 😂😂😂?????
Ozempic doesn’t do what everyone thinks. For an already thin celebrity that is able to drop 20 pounds is noticeable but not for most of us obese diabetics. 😂
Idk why they say it's discrimination when they clearly hate their own body
💙
I am pre diabetes  and i am scared. In may bloodtest ead 6.2 now it is 5.9 so it going down.<br>Only because i start te move more and eat healther. I was 108.5  kg now i am 106.3 😅. <br>Longe way to go. Wish me luck.
"The ""time for school"" got me 😂 <br>Also love how doc probably had no idea about the trans thing and clocked it the same as I did on first sight/hearing the voice 😂😂"
"Commenting on the stepping on scale each doctor appointment thing mentioned at the beginning: even I feel uncomfortable having to see the numbers despite being fairly toned person. I know I'm not in any way overweight, but seeing I am 51kg and not 45kg like kpop idols makes me dysmorphic. I complitely understand the thread of knowing you have to witness the numbers again. Weight fluctuates for everyone and god forbid if it fluctuates upward do you feel shitty."
How did this person get a license to practice medicine????
Drop some pounds…and the T. The delulu is STRONK here.
is that doctor a man or a woman??
ewww....that girl trying to twerk 🤢🤮
This is why AI will come after doctors job because they’re more empathetic than real people.
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
"This doctor deserved to lose her license. As a retired health care worker, this doctor's philosophy is offensive and SAD to me."
💩
"Wait , is this doctor ur talking about a man or a women? U keep calling it, a him and a her....im confused"
He ?????????🇬🇧
"According to that email he has been ""struck off"" it means he can no longer legally practice, i assume you also use that term in the States?"
"The word ""Obese"" it too polite. The term ""grossly fat"" is a much better fit."
Very cute video.  Great concept.  You're amazing.
"Darn it, now I want Cheetos and a good Goosebumps. Also are you sometimes saying she and other times he, or is my hearing bad?"
"like, it is true that the medical system can be unfair to people who are overweight, however, visceral fat does exist, overweight and obese people are more prone to health issues, and it is healthier to be active and to eat healthy."
I just want the BMI scale to be updated.
"I know diabetics who have had feet/legs amputated, gone blind, and died. <br><br>So maybe it’s actually a thing?  😂"
thank you for using his correct pronouns even though she’s.. something!
"I saw in an ObesetoBeast video that this person had tried to lose weight in the past but was, obviously, unsuccessful. They're basically throwing a giant temper tantrum because they couldn't do it. What a baby, if you fail once, just try again!"
💩 just following instructions
"What the absolute—I’m sitting here watching this instead of studying for the mcat. And all I can think is it’s not at all vague what unsaturated fats or triglycerides are or what visceral fat around organs does to you. I’m studying it right now. I literally don’t understand how anyone who studied for the mcat, let alone WENT THROUGH MED SCHOOL, could still think this."
A delusional fat acceptance “doctor” is also trans? Color me surprised
I met someone who was diabetic. They ended up in a wheel chair because of amputations due to being diabetic. Eventually they died not sure if it was because of being diabetic.
You couldnt care less. If you could care less then you do care some.
"LMAO.... This 'doctor'  told me years ago, that  it was no use losing weight, because I would gain it all back anyway within 3 years or so...  And just look at where we are now 3 years later... I haven't gained back and their license was revoked???  🤣😂"
💩
"Dude I'm skinny, and have these same fears as the obese chickies do. I hate going on the scale, I hate the doctors preaching diet culture at me. Over 230 at 4ft, 10in is considered obese. I once had a BMI of 28 at the most, and was called obese.<br>What makes them so special that medical advice is discrimination?"
"The truth is, we just plain didn't have ultra processed foods, fats and sugars in near-infinite abundance until about a century ago. For all of human history, NO ONE ATE LIKE THAT. They literally COULDN'T. Industrial food-like products didn't exist. We're just now REALLY seeing the results of this new way of eating and the results are BAD. I didn't get fat. I just ruined my back teeth, got arthritis in my 20s, and had the WORST case of depression and anxiety that pills could not solve. Guess what fixed ALL of that? Cutting added sugar and ultra processed foods. Sunshine. 🌞 Drinking enough water. Limiting caffeine. And getting enough exercise. Seriously. That was it. The entire time, my diet was killing me. Chances are if you're reading this, it's killing you too. You got this. It IS worth it 💖🕊️✌️"
Is MyFroggyStuff a channel you like? I swear you have that vibe and I love it.
"""you gotta stop using the word obese""<br><br>ok what do you want me to say? Big back blubber built?"
"I see crazy in this ""doctor's"" eyes 👀"
"""Lose your right foot"" eek! cracked me up. Also the doll was a great match as your stand-in."
Omg I love Michelle Verse!! I hope this will be a regular thing! 💕
"Obligatory comment to appease the algorithm! By the way, is it considered proper to call you ""doll"" or ""dollface"" when you're in the Michelle-verse? I don't want to be a plasticist."
"What i dokt understand is why go to medical school for years, suffer through it, go into tens of thousands of dollars of debt just to talk shit like this and lose your licence"
Yeah and telling somebody they have cancer is not exactly great either but do you want the doctor just to not tell you the truth ?
"As of today (20th June) Natasha Larmie is still on the GMC register, with a note that s/he has been given a warning. So either she hasn't formally requested de-registration or it hasn't taken effect yet."
"I love the fact that medical fatphobia is a real problem and grifters are using it to scam people! Truly my favourite thing in the world, nothing says ""I care about fat people"" like taking advantage of them."
"It's about time that dr. Death, had her licence taken!! Who are that trying to convince they are happy.. themselves or us?"
"The ""doctor"" gave some good advice for obesity:<br>""Before you think of opening your mouth..don't..."""
"I had bariatric surgery…and my life has HONESTLY never been the same since! I’m the healthiest I’ve been in 20 years! I feel amazing, I can breath, I can walk, I’m not in pain 24/7, I can shop in normal stores and express myself through fashion now! Yeah it sucks that fashion for fat people just all round sucks. But I don’t have to worry about it now!!"
She looks and sounds like Hannah Gadsby. Well that's a good sign...
The doll is so cute lol
"Maybe the fat  ""doctor"" had a PHD in English or gender studies and pretends to be an real medical professional cause a real doctor would never tell you being obese is fine & dandy."
"As a former morbidly obese person I can confirm that stepping on a scale and being talked down to because your fat does not feel good, makes you more insecure and depressed and leads to some weird eating escalations (at least for me). But what bothered me the most, was the fact that non of those medical professionals ever offered any real help or had suggestions how to lose weight, as I clearly was struggling to help myself. And if the weight gain stems from mental health issues and addiction, those need to be recognized, diagnosed and treated, then weightloss is actually possible. So yeah I wished doctors were less judgmental and more helpful. But that former doctor was just delusional, harmful and outright dangerous. Fat people fear the scale and those lectures, because deep down we know they are right about us. If there were not even a tiny spark of understanding in us we would not feel so afraid and offended. I was fat for decades and know many big people, so this comes from experience. In the end I started losing weight out of a weird coincidence and kept going, slowly but with a strong will. Now after years of struggling I finally got help for my mental stuff and it turns out I have ADHD, which was the reason for some of my food related problems. I am on medication, sober and I can manage my ""snacksidents"". If a doctor actually listend 20 years ago, my life would have turned out differently."
“The fat doctor UK is a TRANS doctor…” why was I not surprised she’d be the “progressive” types
"As a type 1 diabetic for 20 years, it amazes me that a doctor would say that you don’t have to deny your sweet tooth because it doesn’t matter. You can VERY clearly see that diet is THE MOST IMPORTANT THING to controlling your blood sugar, and thus reducing the risk of complications in the future."
Hey a little confused is fat doctor he or she? Because both ger thrown around or do they use them all?
💩
"I literally just finished watch a short on YT where they showed real internal organs of a body and all the visceral fat that was on it. They wear touching it, picking it up and moving all the organs around and everything was covered with fat. You couldn’t even see the heart because it was incased in fat. How is this person a doctor?"
This fake doctor knows exactly what she is doing. She’s a grifter. She knows she can make more money in tiktok pretending to be trans and spewing out misinformation for profit.
Im just saying... all my medical issues have happened since i gained 60 lbs after my mom died. I have to sleep with a CPAP machine at only 28 and have a vitamin D deficiency now so🤷🏽‍♀️
"Yeah, if you cannot stand to weigh yourself you actually do not have body positivity. You actually are not practicing self acceptance. You are in denial about yourself and don't want to know. <br>I'm not condemning having a hard time weighing one's self or just not wanting to fixate on the number, but running away from the reality of yourself hardly seems like personal acceptance."
Oh thank God! It's about time the medical field started fighting back against this maddness. This stupid movement is killing people.
I never truly knew how bad visceral fat is until I saw it irl. It's terrifying what subcutaneous fat and visceral fat actually look like. It's honestly really gross to think about what someone had to do to look like that on the inside.
The barbie chihuahuas are so cute :3
“Fat isn’t real” ah yes my body just magically gets jiggly after wolfing down a caniac combo
"As someone with insulin resistance - amongst a bunch of other congenital shenanigans - I don’t understand how anyone could willingly make themselves ill.  I also don’t understand how that “doctor” managed to get a licence to practice, but I am <b>really</b> glad that they had it revoked.  I’m sure the NHS is truly mourning their loss though… it’s not like it isn’t currently drowning in issues or anything.  😑"
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Anyone else reminded of Miss Trunchbull from Matilda? <br><br>Geez what a con artist. I wouldn't be surprised if he was getting paid off by pharmaceutical companies that obviously make millions of $$ selling diabetes and cholesterol medication to obese patients. These meds cause all kinds of hormonal changes that increase appetite. Her list of cause and effect of weight gain is top tier delulu
"Doesn’t UK have free health care? I know I sound ignorant saying this, but as a US citizen, you think that a country that has free healthcare wouldn’t have anything bad to say about their healthcare system because it’s free. So why would you complain about your healthcare system if it’s free?"
"Wait ✋️  The Fat Dr is a male? I've watched a few of their videos and never for a moment questioned ""her"" gender. I was very confused for most of this, thinking the other Dr was struck off the board. I don't care about who identifies as what, so don't come at me, but I'm shook. I honestly have no idea anymore 🤯"
Omg!!!! The tiny doggos in the Michelleverse!!!!!!❤❤❤
"I'm disturbed it took them so long to strike her off, I can only guess they were trying to treat the obvious mental breakdown this person has had, But they are obviously unresponsive to treatment. It doesn't help me keep faith with UK doctors that they let this person remain a doctor for so long."
Mini-verse is Hilarious. Oh. Love it.
"An unpopular opinion: lean people are actually discriminated against by the doctors. So, I am pretty lean and healthy looking and for that reason my GP never does anything when I come for either a pill check up, or I am ill. I almost died 2 years ago because the doctor was too lazy to listen to me, so I asked for bloodwork, which they consented to me. As soon as my bloodwork reached the laboratory I had numerous calls on my phone that I needed to come to the hospital asap. If I wasn't this insistent I would not be here today, I'd die at only 35 years old because my situation was critical."
Is anyone surprised they're denying visceral fat exists when they don't even believe their own gender?
The michelle miniverse 😂
“He” haha😂
Doc chose ideology over science which she studied and practice for years
I finally found this channel. I've been looking for years.
I'm in the medical field (not to be a doctor) but I've dissected cadavers with students who will be and there is indeed fat around the organs so idk how she just denies that when I'm assuming she had to have the same experience/training to be a doctor
"I was never fat but I lost a few pounds and honestly it’s been helping my anxiety so much!! So yes, weight loss does help. I don’t need statistics, I am my own proof. So it’s mind boggling and sad that these people aren’t listening to their bodies :("
Dude the mini goosebumps?! Can I join your universe? I miss my goosebumps!
"as a bigger woman, ive always believed that health comes first before body. ive struggled with binge eating all my life and half of my body issues with myself were because of things i couldnt do because i was big. running, being out of breath easily, physically being uncomfortable, etc. Im trying to eat healthy, stop binging, exersise more but its hard. in the mean time, im learning to love my body since i cant change it overnight while still being aware that i can be healthier :)"
Why do I just get the sense that Ashmir said all these overly wild statements because deep down he's insecure that he's only a Small Fat and he's trying to compensate? He's like that person that's not really from the hood but when they get around hood people their entire personality becomes a quest to prove that they are Really From The Hood Like Really From The Hood 🤦🏻‍♀️ Lord we pray.
A doctor can not claim that there are more than 2 genders or a male can become a woman or vice versa and seriously hold a licence to practice medicine
Please stop calling this woman he/him. SHE is a woman who is married with children. Her delusions about weight and health are only the tip of the iceberg of her problems.
💩
Imagine being so addicted to food that you like about how unhealthy it is and put your professional license at risk.
great video! cant wait to see more of the michelleverse!
"😂 New subscriber here I have one question, First of all, how dare you? The dolls, the Disney, the absurd, cackling, the DOLLS, the cosplay, the mask, the sarcasm? Are we literally twin sisters? Why did you run away from home? How are we somehow blood related and we’ve never met! You are my spirit animal. Where have you been my entire life? With my entire chest, I love you.❤"
"If it’s not something that needs to be cured, fixed or repaired, why is it labeled as disability in my state?"
I love the Michelle verse!!
"Is this person a ""he"" in the same way obesity is ""healthy""?"
"I do not want a doctor that won’t accept medical evidence to practice, at all."
"I'm just learning about this person. This is like health care people against vaccines! Maybe worse? No, maybe the same. How did they make it through school?!<br><br>I am saying this as a fat person whose dog now is fat😭 Do to me being sick over the winter (the dog part). I'm working on both of us! It is ok to be yourself. But it's important to improve yourself when it's something you can do. What's next? Glorifying poorness? It's terrible people are poor, and it's not always their fault. If said person was offered a job and help being homed and fed, is it wrong for them to take that improvement? <br><br>""They are fine the way they are, no reason to be people phobic! Who needs money? Is it better to be poor and happy, or rich and miserable?"" That's how I see these people. Person tries to improve. Other crazy person gets jealous or something. Crazy person demeans the person who is trying to improve, causing said person to stay in a bad place....🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️"
💩💩The Fat Doctor uk deserves to lose her license. She doesn't realise how dangerous she is. Spreading misinformation by telling people to practically ignore the fat around the heart? I hope she never practices again! Love from London ❤
"""wishing your body was smaller"" Well I started losing the weight again (yoyoed a bit but never got back up to highest) so I ain't gotta wish lol"
Trans and fat activists are the most insufferable people.
"They are shoving their insecurities down  our throats, so they want the world to baby them. Its madness 😒"
It is very dangerous for someone with authority ( like her) to make claims like that. I've seen ppl secondguess themselves over her claims (as ridiculous as they r) solely because she is a doctor and theyre supposed to be trusted. Im glad they got rid of her license.
Ma’am you are hilariousy funny. You got my follow but then again I’m cheap lol
Imagine CaseOh reacting to fat acceptance
"something, something, just letting the Youtube recommender know this is interesting"
OMG I  love the Michelleverse! The tiny chihuahuas! Aaaaa
"We all go on a scale at the dr office. Fat or no. I'm so tired of all of this, but also grateful because I love your videos 😂"
"I empathize (a little) with anxiety over stepping on the scale at the doctor’s, but it can be the literal difference between life-death. <br><br>Anesthesiologists need precise weight to gauge how much to give you so you don’t OD or feel every single cut and stitch during surgery. <br><br>Secondly, I used to take weekly weights for some of my long term patients because their fluids were so out of whack they could experience a difference of 5~ pounds in that time span, which is indicative of underlying issues that needs urgent care."
"I do agree with the sexism. I went to ER the other day after weeks of pain that kept getting worse. The doctor was dismissive and told me it sounds like menopause. I had to raise my voice and demand testing (like really loudly so others heard me) and said NOT everything is menopausal (which Ive gotten from 3 doctors in 2 years)...anyway after testing, turns out Ive had a kidney infection for over a month...so all the menopausal symptoms  'hot flashes"", ""chills"" , ""abdominal discomfort"" and ""fatigue"" were NOT menopause, . Doctors SUUUUUUUCCCKKKK"
I get on a scale at the doctor's office. Everyone does that. They also take you temperature and check your height!!Gosh!
"WHAT SUCKS IS THAT THERE ARE ACTUAL PROBLEMS IN THE UK HEALTHCARE SYSTEM! There ARE racism and gender problems, both cis and especially trans, but the way he goes about it is so anti-science and ridiculous."
"Lolcows make being trans and autistic embarrassing, at least for myself."
"I only know that I, as 180cm male in his late forties,  have less to no problems with my knees with 73 kg instead of 90 kg of weight..... Just wondering, could this be related? Mmmh, just wondering, coincidance? Don't think so😂"
"I love the outro song!!!! Horray it's back!!!! I missed it even tho I also like the ""pick it up pick it up pick it up"" lol"
"If it was discovered today that smoking was harmful, and that it gives you cancer, I can imagine smokers would be like, ""this is all a tobacco phobia"", ""don't ban smoking from public spaces, this is my human right"", ""I don't believe this is harmful, it's all a conspiracy and discrimination and white supremacy"", ""don't call me a smoker, because it hurts my feelings"", ""I was born to be addicted and I love myself the way I am"", etc. blablabla. Just think how ridiculous fat acceptance movement is."
💩
💩
"what is the point of going through medical school if you don't learn something new, or something that challenges your preconceived notions about the body?!"
I'm fat and i don't react as badly as them while in the hospital 😂😂
*she not he
Hearing they r finally losing their license is one of the best parts of 2024 ps please keep the Michelle Barbie as a thing!!!!!!
My husband asked me why I watch a video of a talking Barbie.. i said well this is my weekly source of very important Informations 🤣💁‍♀♥
Lmao love the Barbie insert 😂 your humor and sarcasm is lowkey inspirational.
Discipline with diet (carnivore) and moderate exercise is the key to obtaining your freedom from obesity
💩🎉
I love the Michelle-verse! And the outrosong! Good choice.  An underlying part of it!
"Being obese is healthy,being bulemig is healthy. Everybody knows that. 😂😂"
"“There’s no cure for fatness.”<br><br>Me (who just lost 60 lbs):  “God must just like me more, then. Because I feel much better and my back doesn’t hurt anymore.”"
I am pregnant and my body tells me to eat a cigarette and those juicy pease of a wall...
The fat doctor must of been trained by the same people who trained Christopher Duntsch. If You Know You Know
Still funny girl🎉 diet and exercise is why you're fat. That one floored me
See your doctor as a heavy smoker ....
This delusional person should have never been allowed to have a medical license.
This trans doc making my country look back! 😅I think we should all dismiss information from trans people in general they obviously don't even understand fundamental biology let alone anything else.
Loving THE MICHELLE VERSE! ❤
"Is that person (""doctor"") transgender??? I thought it was a female."
"Omg the doll accessories!!! The cheetos, a goosebumps book!!! And your cute lil dogs! I loveee it! Where do you find these treasures?!"
ah... his? That's not a man... I have eyes.
as a hunter who has been elbow deep in animal organs... I can attest that fat attached to organs is very very true
💩
"How is he supposed to sell his services online if he doesn't hold a license anymore? He's acting as if he can rage quit and continue as normal and because he doesn't recognize the GMC they will leave him to do whatever he wants. If you want to practice in the uk you need a GMC license whether you like it or not, he's gonna get charged with practicing without a license very soon 😂"
"I'm a doctor and I cringe like I've never before listening to this person, maybe because its cringe + anger. The way he just blatantly says there's TON of evidence that being fat doesn't cause any type of harm to the body but losing weight does makes my blood boil, literally every doctor knows how much bs this is and you know why its such common knowledge? Because it's simply true, we see evidence of it every day, his narrative relies on people not doing any type of research because as soon as you look for studies trying to corroborate what he says you'll see everything he says is a lie.<br>The balls on this person to fight other doctors online is astounding"
I'm imagining Michelle changing the dolls possition after every sentence and that makes me laugh for some reason 😂
"Omg the barbie doll holding the mini hot cheetos laughing at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=137"">2:17</a> was amazing lol. the comedy always gets me in these vids. Amazing work as always."
"Mans took a big ol' swig of that sweet, sweet HAES Kool-Aid, and this is where it got him 😂 really, though, of all the people to fall for fat acceptance, the last I'd expect would be someone in the medical field, let alone an actual medical doctor. As someone absolutely in a position to know better, Larmie's peddling of HAES is definitely reckless, at the very least. The UK's doctor shortage must be bad indeed if the GMC was willing to let Larmie continue practising after all this."
He looks like Gypsy roses husband er Ex husband
i LOVE the doll skits lol <3
"My favorite response ever to someone going into long, wordy reasons for why weight gain is caused by everything else except poor diet and lifestyle, is: Ok so if I locked you in a closet for a week and didn’t feed you, you think you’d come out at the end of the week having gained weight?"
Yeah Pre-diabetes doesn't mean you'll get diabetes ... But that's only if you fight to lower your A1C. I had type 2 diabetes. Mine was from the mass amounts of beer I was putting in my system. Once I got sober and tried more healthy forms of eating and watching blood sugar ... I lost it all. My A1C is at 6.0 right now but I still watch it like a hawk. It's the only way to prevent it from coming back.
I LOVE the Michelle Barbie Doll
Lmao did she really said that visceral fat isn't real? There's a whole-ass video on youtube of the autopsy of an obese woman that shows that visceral fat is very much real
"Uh, yes it is. It’s called visceral fat. Where did this chick get her medical degree? Why is the Q community so weird? Also, it isn’t just the medical community, telling them to embrace their fatness. There are a lot of bleeding, heart liberal’s out there, whining about fat shaming and shaming people who shame, preaching acceptance, diversity and inclusion and that includes obese people there’s far too much coddling going on in this world today."
So when I was going in for my gallbladder surgery my blood sugar was high and I was like yea… it has been. The nurse then let me know that a lot of people on kidney dialysis are there for complications due to diabetes. I didn’t even realize I could ruin my kidneys. Terrified me
Ya definitely way out there. Would not listen to anything they say. <br><br>I do agree to an extent there is some prejudice against obese patients as soon as they walk in. I have been brushed off many times and told to just lose weight. (really I had no clue😂) <br> Had a doctor prescribe me blood pressures meds and diabetes meds without blood work results and only said you are fat w. Dark arm hair. I passed out at work bc the meds crashed my system bc I didn't need them.<br><br>But as a doctor you should definitely bring up losing weight for extremely overweight patients. I just don't agree with pushing fad diets and not doing testing first before prescribing meds.
This person would rather spread misinformation and harm other people than admit that there's something wrong with themselves
"as a disabled person ableism isn't mentioned also? that has to be top 3, and fatphobia is not top 3. <br><br>I gained 5 pounds in like a week and I asked my doctor about it and she wasn't concerned at all. There wasn't a bit of phobia of my body and I am a size 14 and my doctor is tiny. Because I am a healthy weight +/- 5 pounds. I went on lexapro and dropped the 5 pounds just as easily. I was concerned I would gain weight but it turns out I eat a lot gummy ropes and sleep a lot poorly when I'm sad.<br><br>Also, weight is obviously related to health and the concerns you are being seen for, it increases your risk for all kinds of things and the doctor has to do more to rule out that you haven't had a clot or cancer when something is wrong because no matter your age obesity makes that much more likely.<br><br> I struggle enough in a healthy size body. You cannot get migraines under control when overweight. I know what having a migraine you can't stop is like, even getting it treated is miserable. I could not bathe myself, I was like a big baby. If my body gave me more migraines I would be knocking on the door of insanity."
Your birthday cupcake is THE BEST!!! So worth the wait.
I was skinny until I got hit by a drunk driver I am 200lbs the heaviest I have ever been I have diabetes fatty liver and other weight issues I am now trying to lose it’s difficult but will be worth it
Omg I love the Michelle verse😂💜
"Sorry is this person a man or a woman, everyone in the comments is calling them a her but in the video she is calling them a he and i am very confused"
People like that seriously make me believe we are in a simulation... like this shit cannot be real..
"Does anyone know the song used in the background at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=100"">1:40</a> ?  She's used it in some of her other videos the circus sounding music"
I'm surprised that being confronted with their fatness is the issue they have with doctors. I'd be more concerned with the fact that some doctors write your complaints off because you're fat when there are actual issues that need to be addressed.
I've never had binge eating issues (except when there's THC involved lol). I tend to eat when I'm hungry but because I'm also on the autism spectrum that means I frequently forget to eat until I realize that I hate everything and everyone to an abnormal degree. I can literally eat just one Dorito or five cheetos and then put the bag away. I dunno if it's good genes or what.
💩
This is just America's problem. No one is this delusional here in Europe
"I'm sorry, I had to pause literally 76 seconds into this video. I have done thousands of autopsies on many, many different species (mammalian and non-mammalian). Fat around the organs is ABSOLUTELY real."
"Ok obese is out too damn fat is in now, engage! I was 340 pounds about 23 years ago, was at 235 a year and a half ago and am at 180 pounds now. Thanks to channels like this that care about health and give good advice I feel better at 59 than I did at 36!"
<i>Finally. I have been waiting for this lunatic to get reviewed by a medical board and that her license would get restrictions OR revoked.</i>  <br>Thank God that the board took it seriously.
Michelle are you misgendering?
we just going to ignore that iStock watermark?
"This person already denies the reality that she is a woman, denying obvious medical truths about being fat, losing weight, etc., is not that far of a stretch. Using ""they"" as a sigular pronoun (when sex is known) is already 🚩🚩🚩"
It took me so very long to figure out who you were talking about because you kept saying he when there was that fat woman doctor on the screen 🤨
"As a person recovering, but still struggling, with an ED I do actually sympathize with people who have horrible anxiety about having to step on the scale at the doctor's office. I always tell them beforehand that I'm an ED survivor and if the number on the scale is even slightly too high for my liking it can send me spiraling back into a full blown dangerous crash diet, like 200 calories a day or less, that can last days or even weeks, so either don't weigh me or keep the number a secret. So I do feel the girl who does not want to get on the scale. Maybe for slightly different reasons, but the fear is valid."
💩
My doctor is fat and she is talking to me that I have an Ed and im anorexic just because I workout and eat healthy 🤦🏻‍♀️
💩
That’s a woman. She’s a wacko. Clearly.
Can you imagine if we applied this same logic to Bulimia or anorexia?
The Hippocratic Oath is a nasty word to this “doctor.”
💩💩💩
"I work in the medical field in the US. I’m NOT a Dr, but the main reason you step on a scale at the doctors office is….wait for it…medication. Most medications that your doctor prescribes you have a kg/mg dosage scale. This means in order for them to correctly prescribe your medication and how much you should take, they need to know your weight. Getting bent out of shape saying you don’t need to get weighed is the same as saying I don’t need my meds. Everything from Tylenol to mental health meds has a kg/mg dose scale. It’s not that deep."
😂😂😂😂 this world is full of cwacks 😂😂😂
"All these people spewing ""fat acceptance"" are just people that lack acountability, it´s easier to blame all your problems on external/internal factors that had nothing to do with you and your choices in life. They just want to live their lives indulging in their addiction and never be taken accountable for what they did to their bodies"
"Their message at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=470"">7:50</a> bothers me because medical misogyny is a HUGE issue, but coming out of the mouth of someone like this along with a bunch of nonsense it invalidates everyone working on resolving this longstanding problem. Also for the life of me I can't figure out what pronouns that thing is supposed to use and I'm getting mixed messages. Apparently trans people will just pass with flying colors once they get to be a human-sized chicken nugget, because obesity lets men and women look exactly the same--a blubberloaf. Why bother with feminizing surgery and test when you can just change your gender with mcdonalds."
"With that acceptance movement It's just a movement to try to make yourself feel better for not having control over your health. When I went from 200 lb to $40 I felt freaking fantastic. I had more energy and stanma and motivation. I felt healthy and I felt strong. I gained weight back and now I feel miserable and as if I can't even jog a mile. Being fat is torturous to your body. I don't want to be crazy skinny and I'll probably never have abs. But I want a healthy weight again and I'm trying hard to get to that. Because being healthy is being good to yourself❤<br><br>Edit: Also just because this doctor's a moron doesn't mean people in the comments can be transphobic. They use the pronouns he/him. It's not that hard to use it. The doctor isn't a she, they are he. Even if I think this doctor is ridiculous and needs to be stopped with their false information. We don't need to be transphobic."
I lost 220lbs from my biggest weight. Back when i was in the 380s i couldnt see my feet. I couldnt tie my shoes without losing my breath. I couldn't walk 2 blocks... I couldn't fit into some chairs desks and whole ass cars. Do i feel better now? Is this body easier to LIVE in?! DUH! HELL YEAH IT DOES. People just want to eat. So eat. Why lie about it being unhealthy?
"funny how diet and exercise brought my dangerously high blood pressure down to normal levels and improved my sleep.  it's almost like losing weight made me healthier, but that can't be true"
Every other video with that format where they zoom in their front facing camera to put emphasis on specific words has subjected me to the most mind-numbingly stupid opinions I’ve heard in my life 💀
Idk why but I'm enjoying the barbie. Makes my inner child happy.❤😅
Just desserts!  😂😂
If they can become a doctor then so can I
I love the “prescribing Lizzo” reference! I laughed so hard when it wound up giving Sharon diabetes 😂
"Diabetic injectables are for the most part still being approved for weight loss use in the UK and would only be available for those meeting a specific criteria, the NHS cannot afford to prescribe them to any and all so...?"
"The addition of the ""Michelle-verse"" makes this channel even more 🤌🏻❤️‍🔥"
"My 10 year old son watched this video with me this morning (yay summer break lol) but he was like ""that was good I can see why you like her"" I was like right I feel like we could be friends if it were real life and he was like ""I could see that, I could definitely see that"" and then off he left to go watch his comfort anime Ranma 1/2"
Where's the pug?  The mini verse needs the pug!😊
sadly there are problems with this but it’s really due to the quality of doctors and a sign you should see a better one if your condition is being dismissed due to weight. this predatory doctor in this video is just as awful. i used to be about 300 pounds (now 125) and i went in with pain in both knees and was told to lose weight and no scans were ordered. years later an MRI revealed i had inflammatory arthritis as part of my crohns and had lost most of my knee cartilage. i’m 27 😒 so i was frustrated with those doctors and sad in retrospect and this is the kind of shit that results in people seeing a “fat doctor”
"So we have to stop the use the word obese and obesity. Those are medical terms. Should we stop using diabetic or cancer? Obesity is proven, note the word proven, to be harmful to the health. That's why it was given a medical term."
"Visceral fat amount is VERY important. I lost 86 lbs and was able to get my visceral fat rating to a 9 :) and is it not worrisome to have an overwhelming amount of fat around organs you need to eat, drink, breathe, and stay alive? <br>I do understand the annoyance of going to the doctor and being told to lose weight when what you have going on has nothing to do with your weight. BUT this isn’t your world and when you don’t fit into the norm you kind of have to suck it up or lose the weight. There are many ways to work around any health things (PCOS) to lose the weight."
"I'm underweight and doctors make me stand on the scale. And then follow up with ""you are underweight, you need to gain weight"".<br><br>That does not mean they are skinny phobic"
💩
💩
SHE! Saying a woman is a man is misinformation too. They are all kinds of delusional.  Saying the truth may get me banned from making comments again bc somehow the truth is hate speech.
"Why are you calling the doctor he and she, is this also a non- binary doc?"
Don't trust any provider who doesn't believe in obesity or vaccinating. 😊
"We need weights in medical not just to track obesity and BMIs, but we also need them to work out medication doses. It's literally part of the math our providers use to calculate that"
"Listening to your videos helps motivate me to keep fighting my obesity. Fat dr demotivates people  and honestly,  him taking hope away from people is likely worse than him just misinforming people."
💩
"That unDoctor is a narcissist, it's so obvious!"
"I work in a doctors office. When I bring patients back I always try and joke when putting them on the scale. I'll say something like ""Ok we're going to start off by stepping on the liar"" or ""Hey, I won't look, just tell me what you want it say"". Had a guy recently try to get out of stepping on the scale saying he was 307 lbs. I told him nope not going to get away with it....he was about 50 lbs heavier. His history showed others putting in 307 lbs on previous visits. That doesn't help him! I get it sucks being obese, but let's not lie about it. It doesn't help you to not be honest."
"Political correctness has nurtured mentali illness into society. Complete detachment from reality. It's socialist politics, penetrating everything and pretending that truth is malleable, adjustable to whatever you want it to be.<br>Clown world. 🤡"
Just for you ❤ 💩
[insert poop-emoji here]
Ofc they are trans
im so confused is it a he or a she
Enjoying a birthday cake doughnut while watching this. These are so delicious now please 🙏 get the lemon back in stock. My husband and I are hooked and now any other doughnut tastes like garbage. Thanks Michelle for ruining any other kind of  doughnuts for us lol yours are so delicious. We’re customers for life ❤️ keep them coming 🙌
"""He"" doesn't believe in obesity... let me guess, she also believes in flat earth, global warming being a hoax, p*rn is good, and vaccines bad? Oh wait, as dumb as all the other shit I listed also is, it's not trendy for pretend leftists (at this point in time...). God these people are a trip and a half. That said, I wish these other doctors who are happy to talk about how anti-science she is about fatness, diabetes, etc, would have the balls/ovaries to talk about how trans ideology is likewise totally anti-science (amongst many other things). I know more and more judgments are happening in europe to try and curb said ideology, but the average doctor is still too scared to speak up even when they know it's bs<br><br>Also... ""fix your racism, sexism, ..."" LOL. Sis, you need to fix your internalized misogyny first before pointing the fingers at others. Actually... you know what guys, you can have ""him"""
"People are desperate to cling to the idea that weight loss doesn't solve anything, but there are so many scientific studies that show the precise opposite. The reason for that is simple: even where an individual has a condition that is not weight-related (e.g. something they were born with) being overweight <b>in addition</b> to that condition is an exacerbating factor 9/10 times, because being overweight is an extra stress on the body. And PSA: many drug treatments have been demonstrated to be far less effective on overweight and obese people, or to have much worse side-effects. This is because the increased dosage required to achieve the same results leads to higher toxicity and/or worse side effects. When doctors suggest weight loss, it's because there's a lot of evidence that it will help with the treatment of most conditions, even if that's only by allowing regular-sized doses of medication to be used."
"Ok since this does bug me. Type 2 is genetic and isn't only linked to weight. I say this because my 90 lbs grandmother had it for about the last 10 years of her life. This is because she became less active when she lost her eyesight. My mother and her siblings are all pre or type 2. My aunt who is as thin as her mom is pre, while my mom is type 2 do to being in a wheelchair."
💩
Oy. The unreality. He this and he that. Nah.
💩
Being obese isn’t real? So… is it my eyesight?
Fat around the organ are not bad...<br>It just keeps them warm n toasty during the winter!
"Just to add, sometimes type two diabetes has a genetic component. For example, my mother was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes while being less than 90 lbs at 5’0” — same with some of her sisters and all of them are size 0’s and 00’s…. But not in the case of the people in the videos you reacted to… that’s def their fault lol"
Omg! I'm loving your doll skits!!!  Keep up the great work!
"Im confused....is this doctor trans? Keep being referred to as ""he"""
💩💩💩💩💩
Lying to someone about what’s dangerous for your health is pure evil honestly
love you michelle you always make me cackle💩🎉🎉
Okay go back to calling us fat since we can't handle the term obese anymore.
I mean the scale this is for everyone……….. not just fat people.Everyone has to do it. So I have no idea why they think it’s exclusive to them lol
She's rejecting biological reality in every way. Delusional.
Ok Mini Michelle laughing while running with hot Cheetos took me out 😂
💩🙈🙉🙊🧑‍⚕️ Went to the doctor in February. He told me I needed to lose weight. Told me to keep my carbs to about 150g a day. Did as instructed. It's June. I'm done more than 30 lbs. I'm turning 60 years of age next week. Quit the excuses. Eat less and move. ❤
It’s a woman. Calling her a “he” is as delusional as denying the existence of visceral fat
I’m currently doing a research project about how aerobic exercise can reduce the inflammatory markers that are associated with type 2 diabetes. A certain amount of weekly aerobic exercise can literally reverse type 2 diabetes….. sooooooooooooo yeah. People like them just use big words to manipulate the narrative and still sound credible….
"Khepri be damned, this “doctor’s” attitude is shittier than Shrek’s stankass outhouse-"
Funny how it's only woman whos on ozempic and men om the mear only that seems a little sexist
💩 I loved that new South Park special!
Call me a bad person but I will have no sympathy when reality of obesity hits “the Fat Acceptance Doctor” in the face Karma will one day come and they will realize how ridiculous their claims were I will laugh and shrug my shoulders as I say “we tried to tell you “
Lost it when the Michelle Doll started cackling
Please take a shower if if your skin is sooty and dark
Thank god they removed her (his? Idk and idc. This is so confusing) license to practice. Now they need to take her our the platform for spewing bs
My boyfriend goes to medical uni and I just... let him decide what I should do and what I should eat and I've never been healthier. So people from medical field are pretty useful. Be nice to them.
"While I don’t agree with the fat doctor UK, I exercised and got a permanent injury.  I did gain weight after it, but it was because I binged out of depression."
💩💩
Fat acceptance movement? More like fat acceptance “roll”ment
"Doctors make everyone,  every visit, step on the scale. Why? Because a change in weight,  in either direction,  can be a clear symptom of something else going on. I had 2 appointments the same week with the same Dr, I was weighed both times, and it's a good thing because it managed to catch something that otherwise would have gone unnoticed until it was potentially life threatening.  They don't weigh people just for the sake of it or to shame anyone.  These people need to get over themselves and actually experience something that they haven't created or imagined for themselves. Must be nice to live in a world where your only problems are the imaginary ones you complain about on the internet."
"I do not understand how anyone falls for this stuff. I am obese and I do not want to be. I am trying to work on my eating habits because they are terrible and long engrained from childhood. But I if lose weight, I can do so much more. I went out kayaking to a beautiful spring with friends today and it was fun, but I can only handle short runs. I hope to do longer runs eventually!"
The Michelle verse is so cute! 🥰
Guess what everyone I had high blood pressure and was about to go on pills until I lost 20lbs and guess what all of a sudden I don’t have high blood pressure! Sure the fat had NOTHING to do with it. 😂😂😂😂
I love the Michelle - verse 😂
"Don't call her a ""he"". Stop with all the delusion..."
💩💩💩💩💩💩
All that work for that license just for you to come out doing stupid shit to lose it🤣😭
He?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=63"">1:03</a> theres litteraly an uncensored autopsy of a fat woman on youtube. Just search for it and you'll see the fat. It's not made up  😅"
💩
Any Video featuring the Mini-Michelle-verse is Best Video !!
I'm so confused. Do you purposely use tons of different pronouns when you talk about trans people? I noticed you did this in another video but I can't tell if it's a schtick or you are honestly getting mixed up lololol. Either way is hilarious.
"the diabetes propaganda in the FA movement is soooo horrifying. i've taken care of numerous patients as young as in their thirties who have many missing fingers and toes already. a lot of them also fight doctor/hospital diets. to add onto that, these obese patients tend to develop COPD and it is AWFUL. we had a ""frequent flyer"" patient (basically means they come in and out A LOT to where the hospital staff instantly recognizes their name when they're in the ER and are being transferred to us). we had a patient who came in weekly-biweekly- and monthly at the absolute most with horrible COPD. he never ONCE followed his diet except for 2 nurses who refused to tolerate his BS lol. he would scream and complain until the kitchen staff literally doubled his portions until they were spilling off of the plate. and yes, all of these people are bitter and miserable, especially the ones with diabetes. if you don't want to prickle your fingertips daily to monitor your blood sugar until they're extremely hard from all of the pricks, diet."
Lol omg i loved thw lottle Michelle doll with two doggies!
"Is there a doctor for this doctor, because this person is delulu."
💩
Why is this person claiming racism? He's Caucasian
❤❤❤
💩
"As a person who has a fatty liver due to other health issues fat around organs is very real, and dangerous."
💩
"I want to lose weight but my life has been as miserable as long as i could remember; I hardly have the incentive to live anymore. I already have pre existing conditions like type 2 diabetes and my mental health nonexistent. I don't have a reason to get out of bed each day. My mother is financially abusive so I never had a job before and she makes it impossible to get one. I had narcolepsy since 15 years of age so I can't drive because of that and she won't allow me to have wifi at home even if I get someone else to pay for it.<br><br>I guess my fear of losing weight is more of if I don't lose a certain amount within a certain period of time, my family especially the ones that ""provide for me financially"" (and I used the word provide very loosely) give me a ton of grief. Also I have been on the same weight-loss journey since childhood and I'm 29. The amount of weight I have to lose overwhelms me into more grief and sorrow. I wished I had better coping skills than eating my sorrows away even now it doesn't give me that warm, comforting feeling anymore. Since I have no income and lost my food stamps back in November; I practically starve myself because I can't afford anything to eat and I might have ADHD or my narcolepsy is mimicking those symptoms and I literally forget to eat.<br><br>I know it sounds like I'm making up a bunch of excuses and I'm acknowledging that I'm completely useless in life. How do I not be so dependent on people who don't give a damn about me? I tried everything I could think of. I tried leaving, therapy, a life coach, seeking employment without my mother's input but nothing worked. It's like the only thing I know how to do is to be a failure at life. I feel like whatever life that was inside me has been beaten and sucked out dry. I feel like my only options I have left is to either end my own life (I can't bring myself to do it so I end up thinking about it all the time) or wait for my abusers to die. Either way sounds god awful. That I have to wait for someone to die just so I can live sounds really crummy. I honestly don't know how I haven't gone off the deep end yet.<br><br>Sorry for the rant but thank you for listening."
💩
I had no idea the fat doctor was a man.
"I loved the barbie dolls, please do a video like this again, it was so entertaining!"
💩
this mentality these people have is so alarming 😭 like there’s so many people like this in the world and they’re having children …
"Appreciate you using correct pronouns/not jumping to misgendering/transphobia when criticizing these people, many other commentary channels do that and it's disgusting. Michelle stay the queen, she know she don't need to stoop down to that shit 👑"
Im L💚ING  Mini Michelle!!!!
Telling people to eat what there craving is like telling an addict to take all the drugs they want. We crave more junk food the more we eat them.
I like the dolls that you've been adding to your skits. I'm glad to see you coming up.  1mil soon!
I love how they always mesh together the whole 👉🏼 insert verb + phobic  mob.
Welp now i know who exactly the ACOLYTE was made for.
"""Fat organs are fake!""<br>Babes, if she actually had a doctor license, she HAD to see cadavers. She wasn't delulu, she was lying for clout and money. Let it sink in."
💩 wink
Fat around the organs is made up?!?! I just had my hysterectomy and the surgery and photos showed it!!!
"Im not happy at my size and I hope to fix that. I almost hit 400 lbs. Im down 60 and hoping I can be under 300 by Oct. I will tell you this, all these fat positive people are out of their minds. It's NOT NORMAL to be winded by ten steps of stairs. It's NOT Normal to sit in a chair and your fat covers your knees. It's Not Normal to constantly be hungry. Its Not Normal to have to ""roll"" out of bed or need help getting to your feet."
"The tiny food is amazing, great work"
A mentally ill person dispensing a mentally ill world view... 😢
Ugh and at all of my prenatal checkups they make me step on the scale… so rude!!! 🙄😆
Y do I like the Michelle-verse so much 😂
"""fat is not real"" bruh, there is so much fat around organs. The fact that we dont pick overweight people for anatomical autopsy is bcs nobody has the time to deal with so much fat."
"Of course the “doctor” who claims that fat is not real is trans, they love denying reality and biology 😂"
"Trauma doesn't cause weight gain, trauma can cause OVEREATING and that LEADS to weight gain. Same with environment and other factors people like to blame. Sometimes people who go through bullying or abusive parents or other stresses and traumas eat their feelings because they can't afford mental health care of there's none available to them."
These people are insufferable.
"Three years from now, instead of having Michelle herself or the Michelle from Michellverse narrating information for us, we'll have Animated Michelle from The Michelling Show narrate for us 😂 Loved the video with the inclusion of the Doll, a nice twist to the usual channels."
i’m loving the michelleverse
💩
💩💩💩💩💩💩
Is this actually real?
He is pathetic really
"""There's no benefit to losing weight"" <br><br>Yeah I'm down 28 pounds, 239 from 267 and I've ALREADY seen a big difference I can walk across a store without being out of breath and tasting metal now. But of course that makes me fatphobic according to them 🙄"
"In other words: ""You can't fire me! I quit!"" With a healthy side of, ""I don't like you so you're bigoted in every possible way!"""
"The outrage from most people who are overweight comes from the fact they haven't been able to find the discipline needed to get to a healthy weight. Yes, some medical conditions can make it harder to lose weight but it's never impossible. I don't judge people if they are happy being overweight, but at the same time you don't get to be bitter toward people who aren't."
“There’s no cure for fatness”<br><br>Exercise. I know that and I’m not a doctor. Even if I was a doctor I’m not going to spread harmful rhetoric as a form of agenda
"TheFatUK, now."
💩
"It’s people like this that say such just brain-dead shit that makes other people not take the LGBT+ community seriously (coming from somebody from the LGBT+, please stop grouping ((ashir not michelle)) us together with these delusions)."
The behaviour is indicative of a cluster-B personality disorder.
"""Are you a healthcare professional?"" <br>""Nope, and neither are you."" <br><br>😂😂😂😂"
Just loving the Michellverse ❤❤😂😂
British person here: yeah ozempic hardly even exists here. People pretty much never get prescribed it. No idea what this idiot is rambling about
"When there's no crab legs: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=404"">6:44</a>"
"I think getting angry on camera is the only exercise these people do, I say let then do more of it, it also gives more content for us to laugh at, its a win win 🤷‍♂"
I’m in pain because of a medical condition I was born with. It is a FACT that obesity makes it worse.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=146"">2:26</a> Um, mini-Michele seems markedly less buff and cosplayey; but we don’t body shame her for that."
The first moment I heard this person speak I knew they were not mentally stable. Everything that comes out of their mouth is delusion.
as a fellow brit we do not claim this person
"""fat around the organs is not real."" Ah, a huge X to doubt. I have seen it when I watched an autopsy with my own eyes. I am glad she had her licence revoked."
hit you with that du du du dud duu
"This “he” is killing me. Lol That is a woman. There, I said it. lol"
Engagement hearts ❤❤❤
💩
💩
She literally said you can’t fire me I quit
"I never understand why people say weightloss is bad for you or harmful, im not obese but i am a bit overweight and stuggle with a binge eating disorder so i decided to go into a calorie deficit, and its helped me so much with prevented my binging and the weightloss has made me such a more confident person, i feel healthier and its the best ive ever been mentally. Demonising weight loss is seems so harmful especially since vulnerable obese people will see these posts and think its healthy to be morbidly obese"
"Hey when I heard I was overweight  for my height, I didn’t get pissy and be like stop that, I worked out changed my food habits to lose weight, and I did I took 6 months but I did it."
They weigh everyone at the doctor... It's just a thing they do!!!
You mean she?
Why are these people so hard-headed to understand truth? Being delusion is also very common. Also being very hypocritical towards people in the same statement.
"You can’t be a healthcare professional while ignoring evidence and science of health. At that point, you’re a poser. You’re just larping. You’re playing dress-up."
"As a <b>gasp</b> THIN I have gone through the first clip. I have Blau syndrome and that can (and probably already is) cause neuropathy, cataracts, uveitis, and glaucoma. All of those are usually caused by type 2 diabetes. I don’t eat perfectly or anything and constant joint and muscle pain make it hard to exercise when I run out of advil but I definitely don’t have diabetes. So to hear a doctor say “all we can do for now is have you eat less and lose weight.” Is pretty infuriating because I know, and the doctors know, that I don’t have type 2 diabetes but that’s all they can do because it usually works."
💩💩💩
"Dysgenic, m entally i ll, J troon is telling people to be degenerate. Imagine my surprise."
How did she graduate. Medicin School.
People are waking Up
I think this “doctor” used google and chat gbt to pass the classes.
"Type 2 diabetes isn’t 100% your own fault, that is not a fair narrative ‼️ Sadly there’s a huge rise in “normal weight” people developing type 2 diabetes due to either genetics, stress or environmental factors but we’re not sure why yet. Yes, the majority of type 2 diabetes patients are still obese and need to change their diet! ☝🏻 But it’s not as simple as just saying “everyone with type 2 diabetes caused their own demise”. Sincerely, a clinical dietitian working in the research field of diabetes unlike the clown “doctor” in the video 😭"
"""FAT AROUND THE ORGANS IS A LIE""<br><br>Autopsy of obese woman: <b>clearly shows fat around the organs (which are also enlarged)</b>"
"Ah yes,<br>   My favorite source of second hand brainrot has posted"
Didn’t know about the pronoun change. I appreciate you. <br><br>The doll edits and skits are great but I missed how expressive you are in this video. <br><br>Ty for the great content
I’m not obese and I’ve stepped on the scale every time I stepped into a medical facility even if it’s just a clinic
glad she lost her license
Omg the tiny plastic puppiessss!🥹😂
"I was one of the (presumably many) people who filed an official complaint to the GMC regarding this doctor around two years ago. So yeah, I'm pretty happy they quit lol."
You can be born with a condition that causes you pain and carrying excess weight would exasperate it so yes lose weight to help ease that pain. It’s not an attack it’s common sense.
"When I crave a cigarette I don’t deny myself and don’t ever tell me that it cause cancer and if I get it, it’s all my fault.<br>Stupid doctors."
"Oh FFS.  I never realized how crappy I felt until I lost weight.  Now, I would never look back.  My doctor waited for me to be ready and then sent me to the right people.  They are there to help.  This doctor would not help, because they are clearly insecure about their own struggles.  Imagine losing your career for this?  What a shame."
Being fat isn't made up.  Race is though.
"I have to go on a scale whenever I see my neurologist here in Ireland along with taking my blood pressure. They’ve caught other underlying issues just by doing that. I have a very unhealthy relationship with weighing scales so I just look up and they take down my weight. It’s normal and happens at every doctors appointment! My mother had diabetes but she kept eating so much sugar to the point it developed into type 2 diabetes which was completely her fault. Buying a giant cake at the shop and hiding it from my dad and eating it in secret. They never want to take accountability! I actually have muscles in my legs now from working out and it makes me feel so good. I’ve never been obese, only slightly overweight when I was younger and I think life is too short to not have that cookie but at the same time, don’t have fifty cookies 😂 love you Michelle!"
I can't believe anyone would be involved with this toxic movement us health and fitness freaks need to come back big time and get rid of this toxic movement once and for all
"""Obese, mid 17th century: from Latin obesus ‘having eaten until fat’, from ob- ‘away, completely’ + esus (past participle of edere ‘eat’).""<br><br>Real word with its own Etymology.  So we will use it whether you like or not."

Mental health...
Im busting my butt to drop 5 lbs in a week after a single cheat day ruined 2 weeks. 400 calories a day for a week and I... WILL... WIN.
They're really letting these crazy people be doctors?..
I thought my fatness was hormonal. Turns out i wasn't drinking enough water. I am able to lose the weight now and because of the water i look a lot better
That doctor used to post content trying to lose weight 😂😂 but then switched her tune and screwed up her career!<br><br>Loving the Michelle Barbie ❤
Nothing like the delusions of other people on the internet helping you feel better about your own sanity.
I love your Barbie story times ❤
💩
"The fat doctor is a woman, “trans” just doesn’t exist"
This is beyond parody 😂 bloody hell.
"Who’s “them”? How many of them are there? I thought there was one doctor with revoked licence.<br>Who is he? The revoked doctor is a woman, is there another doctor with revoked licence?<br>Is this why “them”?<br>I’m confused. 💩"
This woman is seriously unwell. She needs therapy!!
Dr lunatic has lost the plot 😂 we don’t want her representing the UK 🇬🇧 🤦‍♀️😂
"No, Not all diabetes 2 is someone's fault. There is diabetes 2 LADA, which has to do with an immume reaction. My mum has it and she got D2 when she wasn't even overweight."
❤❤❤
I mean I get acid reflux as a somatic symptom of anxiety. But I definitely feel better physically at 160lbs than i did at 210lbs.
I'm loving the Michelleverse 🥹
I want to move to the Michelleverse. It sounds like the best place to be!
To be honest I really hope Michelle does a video of the South Park episode because that special is right up her alley of commentary. Plus it was one of my fav specials.
In defence of people going to doctors.   i had a gastric sleeve because i was so big @ age 19  because the dr who performed surgury to remove MRSA and cellulitis told me i should.     turns out my body was storing fat to save itself because of the MRSA and cellulitis  and now im in a world of health issues.
"Michelle: ”we need to protect your precious brain""<br><br>Me: <b>suspicion that Michelle is a zombie who wants to eat brains 📈</b>"
Ive never been weighed at the doctors. (Uk here)
This planet ..... i swear...
it's not a he. It's a deluded sad and very toxic woman.
"Fat around organs is very real. Fat deposition is a way to store energy not immediately needed in regions like the cheeks, breasts, thighs, abdomen, some organs like the kidneys, liver and so on. Women do have fat pads in regions like the back too, to serve as cushioning for carrying a child(supposedly). Its a normal physiological process. But when the body keeps recieving more of it and the levels of activity drop, the body has to store it because it doesnt need that and can't let it circulate. Uncontrolled, this can lead to pressure on different organs like joints and internal organs, deposit in regions like the forehead and when everything fails, fat accumulates in the blood vessels (causing CAD or PAD) or increase risk for a fat embolism as a result of conditions like fatty liver or an orthopaedic injury. Uncommon but fatal. I can list many more complications of being obese but these are the main ones off the top of my head."
I went from 193 pounds to 150. I think weight-loss is possible.
"The unfortunate part is that this isn't gonna wake anyone up to reality. He's a martyr now. ""They're trying to suppress and oppress!"" and all that 🙄"
There are literally videos on YouTube of cadavers with visceral fat.
She is basically unethical ; Doctor being a noble profession shouldn’t be made personal and should be strictly stick to studies and researches.
From where she has done her medical degree😮Doctor seriously🤮
love the dolls 😂❤ please make it a reoccurring thing
"Do fat people know that when the Aliens come or the zombie apocalypse happens, the fat people will be eaten first?"
"So the fat doctor got the title revoked....is she now just...""the fat""? i think thats hilarious"
"Hi Michelle, just wanted to let you know I started working out daily. I started skateboarding a week ago and although it's a work out it's a lot of fun."
💩
"Was fat doctor Uk always trans? I don’t remember, is this new knowledge? Just wondering"
is it a he or a she?
"Ok, I totally love the barbie set!! 😂💕<br>I hope you're healing well, Michelle!! Love your content, you make me laugh AND you inspire me 💕"
A woman who thiks she can change into being a man also thinks weight loss is harmful and adipose tissue doesn't form around the organs. AND she's American AND she's a doctor. Yep. That checks out.
"Love that Michelle called the doctor ""he"" half the time 😂"
"Personal question... does your butt burn when you've eaten some flaming hot cheetos? I swear I hear my butt yelling ""no more cheetos"" whilst on the toilet."
💩 for the algorithm & a sh*tty doctor.
💩
"Michael, love the channel. Doctors will even sometimes prescribe very specific diets that are not related to diabetes or weight loss. Look into Interstitial Cystitis & urinary incontinence. <br>If somebody on the body positive community had these conditions and went and saw a doctor they would be horrified at the diet!"
10 years of education and a great wage scrapped for mad rambling courses that will make them around £50 a month if there lucky .<br><br>They went from being an actual doctor to doing basically the fat white girl version of QAnon just random conspiracy theories and wild opinions.
lol thefatdoctor making sure doctors always have clients .....obese is like healthcare's main client
fune
I'm 55kg and my routined Rheumatologist visit includes blood tests and checking vitals such as  my blood pressure oxygen and my weight is checked as well and monitored whether I've gained or lost weight especially being on medication to treat my autoimmune illnesses. I've never been to any doctor and my weight isn't checked and I'm not overweight and on the smaller side.. The doctors telling these fat people to step on the scale isn't targeting them. Ya'll ain't special and that's done to most if not all people. I even went to do an ecg the other and the lab tech checked my vitals and weight to add those info to my report.
I enjoyed your doll stop-action. I can’t believe you found mini dogs like yours. That was the cherry on top.
Haha! Love these videos
That’s a woman. They/them/hfournwbfkaduwowje is the thing that doesn’t exist
You played The Song at the end!<br>THANK YOU!
"these kind of people in TT should be avoided at all cost! using delusions and personal propaganda for the group on medical facts are highly concerning and dangerous!<br><br>btw, I love your presentation and style there 😁👍🏽"
💩💩💩
The Michelleverse is popping
He?
"There's 2 Ytuber that I'm watching. Both were obese and unhealthy: Dashie went to the  they told him that he had fat on his organ. After his checkup, he throw all his fat food in the garbage and started going to the gym. From 3 years ago, look at him know! Health and have more energy.<br>The other Ytuber Jasmine is doing gym video. She lost 150 lb and more. She's healthy and happier. Big difference for those delulu Tiktoker!!!"
I miss seeing your face and expressions. 😭😭 Barbie is cute but your reactions makes it the best
"I'm all for fat acceptance, but not for fat enabling. Meaning, you're not suddenly become special just because you're fat, you're just accepted as part of society. If you do something harmful for society, that means you're also can be punished."
"You know, I ain't even mad that I just watched a Barbie doll of Michelle save me from rotting my brain...lol."
There’s a point where your too mentally ill to prescribe.
"What do they mean ""visceral fat isn't real""? Have they ever attended an autopsy? Or a surgery?"
The EHEHE while running off with the hot cheetos ended me 😭
"There IS a God!  She never should've had a license in the first place with all the harmful, deadly information she spewed!  This is what happens when you get your ""license"" from the back of a cereal box."
Why does this medication work? Because you lose your appetite.
love the miniverse!!!
"Your Barbie makeover is awesome! Love the media approach. <br>Now, let all of us sit back and wait for fat doc to be hospitalized for complications of obesity."
Ozempic is for diabetics not for fat arses to lose weight do it the old fashioned way I was 120kg my doctor said I would die before 30 if I didn’t  change I had fatty liver a enlarged spleen and pancreas and also a massive stone in my gallbladder I’m now 68kg I went on a strict diet of only salad vegetables and chicken I had Greek yogurt in the morning lunch I had a cup of soup and dinner was the chicken and salad I lost 60kg within a year I got lose skin since I lost it to fast but if I didn’t lose it fast I probably wouldn’t be here typing I do an hour a day each day on the exercise bike and rower machine if you need help to lose weight don’t take ozempic take( SAXENDA ) a medication that is for weight loss and not taking it out of the diabetics hands ❤
What the fuck how many people has she told all this to????
"I don't  like, that the Barbie is talking. I like videos there is the Michelle  Talking.<br><br>I saw these body slices in the ""Body"" science fair. It's  so shocking.  Everyone should  see that, viceral fat is real and it helped me to stick to my diet. I don't  want viceral fat crushing my preciuos organs."
💩
I was pre-diabetic at 14. It absolutely was my fault.
"""At least you're still fat, you have that going for you"" that was art"
when you called them he my brain malfunctioned... they straight up sound like a woman.
"Shes saying to eat what your MIND wants, not what your body needs or wants. Sugar/food addiction is soooooo hard to over come because my brain begs me to indulge and consume all that it’s craving, it’s hard to deny those cravings. It’s easier fkr these people to build a delusional world where their addiction to food isn’t life threatening, dangerous or even real. It’s easier to live in denial than to face the ugly truth that they’re eating themselves into an early death and change their life style. They’re so aggressive and hateful because the delusion is fragile and they depend on it in order to not spiral. Its a mess of mental health issues and I feel bad for these people to be honest."
My doctor prescribed me trulicity to help me lose weight. I don't eat a lot and I have been exercising. Hopefully it helps.
You deserve 1mil Michelle! Let's goo! 🔥🔥
No cure for fatness 😂. The most ridiculous statement I’ve heard. I’m glad they got their license revoked. Makes me want to attempt medical school to work towards disproving these nutters.
"Well now that her license has been revoked, she could likely make a killing hiring herself out to right wing media outlets as the poster child of what the left does to you when you actually internalize all of their ideas."
"Whenever people talk like this doctor, discouraging self-improvement, the only thing I hear is ""misery loves company"". 🤷‍♀"
💩
While Type 2 diabetes can be your fault it is not always your fault.  You can eat your way to Diabets Type 2.  But not everyone who gets it has done that.  It is not always sugar that causes it.  I don't eat alot of sugar nor have I really ever.  I was born with Hypoglycemia and not being diagonsed as a child and having a mother who starved me caused me to have sugar imbalances and insulin resistance. It took a very long time to get to prediabetes and I have been batteling predaibetes for 15yrs now.  I am doing everything I can to keep from getting full blown Type 2 Diabetes.  I keep my blood sugar in as much check as I can.  And correct my sugar as soon as it drops too low so that my body insulin resistance does not get worse.  And you can actually get Type 1 at any time.  You do not have to be born with it.  It is just more common to be born with it or get it at a very young age.  It has to do with your pancreas and liver.
"Has that dimwit never seen and xray, CT, or MRI ever??????  It will show the fat around the organs."
"I dont get what these people dont understand. I lost 50 lbs, and my knees do not hurt the way they used to, but the fat caused issues that I have to live with. My left knee keeps almost giving out, dont get me wrong, HS sports didnt help my knees, but the weight made it so much worse"
Its trans people like this that make all of our community look bad
You should call it minichelle verse lol
you know what else isn’t real? being trans/nonbinary…
💩
First time I saw someone cover something on the “fat doctor” I thought it was some bullshit comedy stunt. When I realized this was a real thing and this person was serious I took 100 pegs down for humanity 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
🟤
Here's my 💩 emoji lol
Why do they care about stepping on a scale if they accept themselves just the way they are?
"I want to hate her, but.....she's so confused, guarded and angry. She's to be pitied."
Doctors can’t stop using medical terminology because it is a universal language that doctors speak all around the world. One doctor on one side of the world can communicate with a doctor in another part of the world even if they don’t speak the same tongue.
"I'm diabetic (type 1.5). My cravings are so severe I will eat until I vomit and then eat more. My body tells me to eat constantly because I don't absorb the energy into my cells and so I always feel hungry. If I ate ""intuitively"" and ""listen to my body"" , I would eat myself into a literal coma (I've been in a coma from ketoacidosis before). It's a shame this person calls themselves a physician, they're going to kill somebody. And yes visceral fat is a real thing."
"I have high cholesterol and i think this guy is an IDIOT. I may have no self control about food, but am I gonna complain and ask for accommodations if i gain weight? No. I’m gonna suck it up or work out 😭"
Can't wait to check my weight on Monday.  I worked out a schedule walking a mile uphill every day and eating normal meals. Most of the ladies here in butte Montana have amazing legs cuz the town is basically one big steep hill.  I have only seen two people here over three hundred lbs.  Most women here have muscles.  I'm so happy!!
"I lost 20 pounds in three months this year, in a conscious and intentional act of fatphobia.<br>Cut out meat, dairy and alcohol, tracked my calories. Moderate exercise.<br><br>It felt good to disprove so much of their nonsense"
Michelle getting into dolls is one of the best things 😆
"I cant w the argument these ppl use that the doctors only reason for wanting their clients to loose weight is a general hatered for fat people and not due to health reasons. Honey. Doctors dont give a fuq about how you look or how you are precived by the general public.Their only job is to keep u physically healthy, be professional and to not loose their job. 😭😭"
I'd love to visit the Doll Universe 😗
"Nothing to see here, just an obese Dr. telling his obese patients that they are not obese."
❤❤❤
The new medical term is adiposity based chronic disease.  No one should be using the word obesity anymore.
I've been WAITING for this!
"I came here to hear about some dumdum getting some consequences, but I got my world rocked with that pic of Tammy. I know I don't keep up with much, but DAMN I had no idea she'd lost so much weight!!! She looks like a whole different person, and I'm so happy for her!!!"
💩
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩 nine poop emojis for her nine laughing emojis
She! She! She!
"Fatphobic is the dumbest, most ridiculous term Ive ever heard and the funny thing is its not even being used correctly  by those throwing it around. People arent ""afraid"" of fat people or even of being fat themselves- people are sick of obese peoole demanding special status as a ""marganalized group"" with all the specual treatment that entails based on a condition you brought on yourself and one that could be addressed with nothing more than EFFORT.  We wont be gaslit."
There's a mortician that I follow and he's shown cadavers with fat around and in the organs. Ive also watched an autopsy of an obese person that died of a heart attack. Fat around the organs is a real thing that will kill you. I don't understand why these BP people worry about being weighed if they're comfortable with their body.  The number on the scale shouldn't matter.
What a crazy woman. SMH
Ngl I like the Michelle ‘verse
"Great video except one thing. There are people that get type to diabetes and it is not their fault. I am a type two diabetic and have been since I was 15. For years, we didn’t know if I was a type one or type two of how young I became diabetic. Only when I was 41 did they figure out that it’s two but it acts more like type one and it’s genetic."
You had fun with the barbies huh
"I’m glad I just found this channel, wish I found it sooner. Love your content, your delivery. It’s honest and humorous. Looking forward to more content!!🎉"
"I am not overweight—right in the middle range of “normal” (whatever that is)—and I always, 100% of the time, decline weighing at the doctor. I only do it if it is relevant to amount of medication (like anesthesia). No doctor has ever said anything about it. I just don’t like to be weighed!"
I LOVED THE MICHELLE-VERSE
Lmaooo I like the Barbie with her Cheetos
"In a time where everyone us screaming about freedom of speech, we sure aren't allowed to say a lot. Taking words from the english language isn't making the issues disappear"
"Ok, this has been bugging me for a while. In the outro song, is that Michelle singing???"
Reminds me of the woman who went in front of Congress insisting the covid vaccine made people magnetic.
"I don't understand, if they embrace their body then why do they get butthurt when doctors point out what could happen with their large bodies? It's like everything they say is only projection! And that they don't actually love their body, because if you loved it you wouldn't feel the need to say it and just be comfortable and confident. But they embrace their fat bodies but if anyone reminds them that they are fat, they get upset. Does anyone understand that?"
The michelle universe is great. with the doll.
FatDoctorUK literally said they'd rather be <b>diabetic and happy</b> than losing weight and lowering chances of diabetes. Do you actually know <b>anyone</b> who's diabetic and happy about it???
"My boyfriend that’s a doctor said the fat acceptance movement has been trying to change how they work and their entire argument is you won’t die immediately because of obesity, but they are ignoring their quality of life and the struggles that come with obesity. These people need to focus on real issues"
"Do you know it’s really fat phobic? Telling someone they can’t work out and that it’s not worth it just because they’re fat. That’s literally the statement they’re putting out. The statement that most of these types of people put out. “ it’s not your fault you’re fat but it’s not like you can lose it. I mean look at you you’re fat so no point in trying I mean it’s not like we’re lazy but why even try “ or “ food doesn’t make you fat but we’re gonna eat more food because food does make you fat and we gotta show it to the haters” it’s literally clawing their insecurity. All these people are insecure because confident people don’t speak this way all they do is complain all day about every aspect of their life. and people who are“ proud” of themselves, don’t act like this. They can never recognize any type of issues that come with it because they’re not proud because if they were proud wouldn’t they have no problems with that & embrace it with open arms but no, it’s immediately like shut all down because they’re not happy. happy people don’t have eating disorders"
💩 ❤
"I don't disagree that all those stuff CAUSE the weight gain.  Like trauma & stress can cause eating.  Depression can cause laziness. But it's not moving & eating too much either way.  That is the MEDICAL & physical cause. & the treatment is eating healthy & exercising & go to therapy if those are your issues.  If you're genetically stocky like me, YOU CAN STILL LOSE WEIGHT."
"I am clinically obese (according to BMI) and definitely overweight (I'm a 32 y/o female, 205lbs at 5'8"" -- with my lean muscle mass I should be around 165lbs - 170lbs to be out of the risky weight range). I have had health issues for a long time, even when I was a healthy weight. HOWEVER. My weight makes them a LOT harder to manage and certainly makes my life more challenging, particularly being in pain all the time. So yeah, my weight RIGHT NOW isn't why I'm sick, but it is not helping. I started at 213lbs and I am down to 205 😊 and still going."
"Not me screaming  when u said ""little hammocks ""☠️☠️☠️"
They realise doctors aren't weighing them to tell them they're overweight. But that's usually a side effect of nearly breaking the scales... it's for prescriptions.
Dark chocolate Milano's.....YUM! I haven't eaten one of those in years!

Oh my gosh I love the doll inclusion. It’s so funny 😂😂🤍🤍
If they believe being fat is healthy and beautiful why are they so scared of stepping on a scale?
"Instead of FatDoctorUK, how about FAFOUK - as in eff around and find out?"
It’s crazy to me that this person has a job in the medical field to begin with 😀
She originally wanted to become a  well-known as a great weightloss doctor! There's a video on the internet
I'm British and this makes me SO happy.
She went absolutely insane.  It's sad.
Ok I just wanna say something why do people say diets don’t work because I can’t eat fat since I was born because my illness and I don’t eat healthy all I eat is sugar and I’m 115 pounds at 16 and never been fat because I can’t eat fat so fat free diets do work I just don’t think it’s healthy because I have to take this stuff and there’s a bunch of worries because your body needs fat but can people stop lying and admit if u stick to a diet it will work
"Mfers out here trying to make ""obese"" a slur, like, what!? Get offline"
Screw it I'm going to start calling businesses short phobic.
"Can obese white people please stop comparing ""fat phobia"" to racism please? It's overdone and exhausting."
That doctor hates herself. She claims she’s trans but clearly still presents as a woman. She’s a bitter person who clearly has a personality disorder.
I love the miniverse☺️
Do these people know that doctors weigh us so that if they prescribe a medication they can give us the proper dose??
"I love the mini Yoshi, Butters and Rigby toys!"
"Willingly giving up her medical license so she can continue to give ""health* advice with no repercussions from Hippocrates. Now that's what I call avoiding ethical dilemmas."
I work at a hospital and we do a depressing amount of amputations. Most of the patience getting the amputations are about 400+ pounds and usually diabetic related. The ones that are not it’s usually an ATV accident.
I'm still confused.  Is this a he or she?  A man or a woman? What is it?
Intuitive eating only works if you are eating foods that are whole foods. It's really hard to over eat healthy foods like baked chicken vegetables and fruit.
so did they transition to she or he?
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=128"">2:08</a>  The Mini-Verse!  🤣🤣🤣<br><br>All-you-can-eat Cheetos & no need for a bra = Heaven!"
Why do these fat influencers always film their tik tok s so damn uncomfortably close to their face😭😭😭😭
"She is dispicable! She has found a vulnerable target audience, feeding them lies which she as a medical professional does very much know to be wrong using her medical degree as proof that she is right! Who ever is questioning that is racist/sexist and all the other -isms and -phobias just to diminish their expertise and to attack their characters. But what she actually does is capitalizing on these people who need real medical help because she is selling masterclasses, courses, seminars etc. to them. She has no morals or ethics and they absolutely should take her license away!"
More Michelleverse 📢📢📢
"You absolutely have fat around your organs, unless you are seriously underweight.  It's very important to have that fat layer to protect your organs and to help you stay warm.  Even slender people have it.  You just shouldn't have a lot of it.  I'm glad they no longer have a medical license."
"Omg, I loved this video! ❤"
"The only made up thing is her entire personality, contrived!"

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=19"">0:19</a>... I'm about 145 pounds at 5'10"".<br><br>Every time I go to the doctor I have to step on a scale. It's just part of going to the doctor. Just like your pulse and blood pressure."
She has to be getting off on this. You can see proof of visceral fat on cadavers in an entry level anatomy class.
"I was waiting for a ""and it's fantastic"" when she said ""because I'm plastic"" 😭😭😭"
"The opening thing. Like, yes, there are issues that can be with you your whole life regardless of your weight, but being bigger sure as shit ain't going to help those issues."
Are they a he or she because you can’t seem to make up your mind constantly switching throughout the video 🤦🏼‍♀️
did he geld himself?
"Triple-positive ductal carcinoma is definitely linked with obesity. Both of which I have. Been obese for most of my adult life. I was doing well weight-wise when I was dx with the cancer at age 40 in October  2023. Gained a lot of weight during treatment because fat brain be fat brain. But I'll be damned if I don't buckle down and manage the one thing that IS within my control to try and prevent it from coming back: getting my weight back under control. I may be fat and sick, but I'm not stupid...like this former doctor."
"Not only is that thing a fat POS and a disgrace to the medical community, but is also one of those transmission things? Fucking lulz"
Yeah they make everyone get on the scale because when they prescribe medication it's often dosed based on weight
She.

I’m loving the mini-Michelle-verse! Sooo cute and creative! ❤
slay for still respecting their pronouns/gender identity
‘he’? are her pronouns he/him?😂😂😂😂
I love the miniverse.
I went from a bmi of 46 to a bmi of 32 I’m so happy I finally listened to the doctor
Love the michelleverse! ❤
I missed the real Michelle 😢
You can't fire me i quit
Her delusions run thick
I want to live in the Michelle-verse
That's one beady eyed creepy creeper. 💩<br>Love the outro song ❤
We're using he/him for women that don't even bother to transition now?
"Is the whole idea of been fat doesn't effect health<br>is the new smoke is healthy ?<br>I mean when doctors suggested people to smoke, because it's healthy"
I'm sorry. The use of the doll is hilarious. 😂
"I have a friend that has been obese her whole life telling me some really concerning stuff like that some people have just a natural tendency to be larger, that her body is just that size because is programmed to be that way, other times she also tells me that she feels like she's not supposed to be that way, that it's because of her parent's divorce (mind you also her mom and sister are severly obese and drinking exclusively coke) and I'm actually concerned about her. Don't know how to approach the subject cause she tends to be touchy about it. She has been opening to this since I've gained weight due to pregnancy and ppd. But unlike her I'm aware that it is completely in my control to go back on track. I just know that things will improve on e my boy sleeps a full night and I don't feel like starving at 3am after feeding him. It's a long road ahead but I will not let myself become her, I will stay completely aware"
So sad to see people who work hard to study and achieve a profession just to get so lost in crazy ideologies on the internet and ruin their entire lives and careers just to get likes from others demented people online 🤡
"Aaaaah, mini-Michelle doll, love herrrr ❤❤ 😂"
Extra
love how you shipped back into she pronouns a few times. 😆
💩
"I lost a large amount of weight a few years ago due to chronic illness and now I'm very underweight. Doctors CONSTANTLY lecture me about my weight, say how I need to eat more, gain weight etc.  The weight lecturing is not just done to obese people, it's done to EVERYONE. Get over it."
"Fun fact about diabetes: type 2 diabetes can degenerate in type 1 diabetes if you don’t follow a specific diet made for you and take medication. Also, these are a few of the side effects of having diabetes and not taking care of yourself and your health: blindness, heart disease, brain disease, need for amputation, etc. The moral of the story: if you have diabetes, TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, regardless of type. Diabetes is diabetes. Also, I am speaking as a person who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at 6."
Michelle is entering her Barbie stop-motion era! 💃🏾<br><br>Here's the 💩 emoji to show I watched till the end.
"Indeed, just because you are fat doesn't mean you are lazy. It means you eat too much calories and unhealthy"
"I just want to say that i love love love the mini Michelle verse! Its so cute, the mini hot cheetos bag and book gave me life!"
I think it is hilarious that they received notice of an investigation into their ability to practice and their response is:<br><br>“lol no! I quit unless you meet my demands!”<br><br>Like that isn’t suspicious at all and it’s not like they’re the only doctor in the country.
💩
💩
Oh my goodness look at tammy slaton! She looks incredible!
Her ideas on health and overweight individuals is pretty 💩
"I have trouble believing this person is a doctor. She claims in the UK that doctors will just give you Ozempic. Firstly, in the UK, Ozempic is not prescribed for weight loss: it’s Wegovy (same thing but diabetics get one, and obese people the other and never the other way round unless they go to a private clinic). Secondly, GPs can’t prescribe Wegovy -you have to be referred to a weight loss service at a hospital. There’s long waiting lists and very stringent criteria and quite often rather than Wegovy you’ll get liraglutide which is a daily injection (if that). <br><br>This person appears at odds with reality."
"It's concerning to hear that a doctor believes obesity is solely a non-individual issue and dismisses the existence of visceral fat. Scientifically, visceral fat is well-documented and recognized as a significant health concern due to its association with increased risk of metabolic diseases. Dismissing its existence seems unprofessional and contradicts established medical knowledge.<br><br>Regarding the factors contributing to obesity, while genetic predispositions and environmental influences play roles, it's essential to recognize that lifestyle choices, including diet and physical activity, are major contributors. Research consistently shows that dietary changes alone can account for 70-80% of weight management efforts, with exercise contributing an additional 20-30%.<br><br>While factors like trauma and environmental conditions may influence weight, individuals can still exert significant control over their health outcomes through informed choices. Encouraging patients to make gradual, sustainable changes in their diet and activity levels can lead to meaningful improvements in weight management and overall health.<br><br>Addressing the concern the doctor raised about hunger and emotional eating (""listening to your body all the time""), it's crucial to differentiate between physiological hunger and emotional triggers for eating. Emotional eating can be a sign of underlying emotional issues or eating disorders that require professional intervention. Suggesting that eating is a solution to emotional distress oversimplifies complex psychological factors that should be addressed by qualified mental health professionals.<br><br>In conclusion, promoting a holistic approach to health involves understanding and addressing all contributing factors to obesity, including genetics, environment, and psychological well-being. Medical professionals must support patients in making informed decisions about their health without disregarding the significant impact of controllable factors like diet and lifestyle."
i really do love the Michelle -verse content!
That is a he? So they are fat positive and transgender? Just doubling up on labels I guess
"I was at doctor's office 2 days ago and she told me to step on the scale too, I'm not obese or even close to being chubby, so maybe they are making everyone to step on the scale? It's useful when they want to calculate the right amount of meds"
My girl who is 265 lbs absolutely hates the whole  fat acceptance and fat positive movement.
Love Dr. Idz.
"There are definitely instances where doctors tell patients to lose weight when weight is not contributing to the issue (like being 5lbs overweight and a doctor saying you have to lose a minimum of 20lbs, which happened to a friend of mine and was kinda weird cuz she was there for migraines?), but downright claiming AS A DOCTOR that obesity, visceral fat, and pre-diabetes isn't real and not your fault is definitely dumb as hell. We have evidence of human cadavers with visceral fat. We have proof pre-diabetes turn into T2 diabetes. We have proof obesity kills people. I hope this person doesn't get to practice ever again cuz they are DANGEROUS"
Well if you were healthy you wouldn’t be fat….
"Lol, as a VET, we weigh animals when they come in. 😂😂😂😂😂"
Bro needs to see an autopsy. That'd change his mind about the existence of visceral fat I'm pretty confident
"This is why it's not always a good idea to ""look at both sides"" some sides are bonkers"
"When you see ads that say something like ""9 out of 10 doctors recommend a health breakfast"" this doctor is that 1 who apparently doesn't"

This Dr is putting people in danger by spreading misinformation violating the oath so good riddance.
"If they accept their weight then why are they scared of the scale? Keep a check on ones weight at the doctor is Important. There are drugs that, if administer, they would need to dose according to weight."
"I mean, fat Dr should have had her licence revoked when she started thinking she was a hetheywhatever. Because it's medical biological truth, just like fat around the organs.<br>She can ignore one because she ignores the other 😜"
u r so fucking confusing me<br>do they use she or he pronouns? or both<br>cuz u always say smth else lmao
As much as I love seeing your face I was CAAAAACKLING the entire video and I loved the barbie.
There’s no cure for fatness lol there literally is
"If they really love being fat, they shouldn't have a problem getting on that machine and showing how fat they are. 🤷‍♀️"
Mediocre white women just gotta be mediocre white women
Thank you Michelle  for having the respect to not misgender this person and focusing on the facts that matter to this story. Another fun video!
"I have insulin resistance and it sucks but Im not gonna cry while eating icecream about it, why is it that bad to cut sugars a bit, its not even like completely its just having less of it"
"scales should be a gas stations. walmart,publix ,the restroom, McDonald's ect. everywhere"
"They weigh everyone, not just fat people. It's part of a medical record.  Also, you can refuse any treatment or test, including being weighed. But why do you go to the doctor if you don't want to get an assessment of health?  If you don't want to be assessed for health, don't go to the doctor. It doesn't make your problems go away."
"I mean, I fully agree with all your criticism of their statements and position but there's no need to misgender them."
"I once saw this American cartoon from the 1980s. Really dark humour. A bunch of emaciated concentration camp inmates are angrily scowling at the one fat concentration camp inmate, who declares ""It's not my fault, I have a glandular problem!""<br><br>Really dark and cynical, like I said. But it's a cartoon BECAUSE this is absurd. At no point in any human society have people with a calory deficit ever stayed fat because of their fat-person metabolism. Never. You ingest less calories than you burn, you lose weight. You eat more than you burn, you gain weight. It's not an attack on you personally, any more than the weather or gravity. It's simply a fact. So why is it so hard to accept responsibility for your weight? <br><br>And what's worst: telling people not to take responsibility for their weight is actively discouraging people who want a healthier life. It's just mean."
💩💩💩
Plastic Michelle is almost as pretty as the real Michelle.❤
"Medical diagnoses are offensive. Doctors should not tell anyone if they have cancer, heart disease, liver disease, pulmonary fibrosis or any disease that can result in death. That is offensive. Doctors should just tell people to continue their lifestyle and love the body they have. No treatment necessary. Offending them by telling them they have a serious medical disorder will cause psychological damage. Body positivity is the cure for all illness."
"All I see in their videos is a bitter, angry, awful human being who seems to love being miserable and wants everyone else to be just as bad off."
"I am a Dialysis Nurse. If you listen to this person (fat doctor UK), there’s a huge chance you’ll end up one of my patients!! Especially if the a normal doctor is telling you to lose weight and you have hypertension or Type 2 DM. Please don’t play with your health!!!"
"The fat doctor isn’t even a male.<br><br>I don’t have to respect the pronouns of anybody who doesn’t have my well-being at heart and as a doctor,<br><br>SHAME ON HER for spreading HARM!"
"I misspoke at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=835"">13:55</a> - God tempts no man. Thank you for those who pointed this out to me.

"Stop arguing, the truth is God will decide."
"The LGBT Pastor is forgetting the audience of the book of Romans, the Letter is directed towards the Romans.  The whole concept of Christianity is separating the people of the Book and the Christians from the common world and setting them apart for the worship of God."
those demons inside that man were manifesting
Saying Gay preacher is like saying Queers for Palestine. It doesn’t make a lot of sense.
Shame. We can only pray for this man. His love is not from God. Only Holy Spirit can convict him
Can we please stop calling the gay guy pastor. He ain't a pastor.
Imagine thinking you understand the cultural context of scripture better than Paul - a renowned Pharisee. This kid's narcissism is on another level.
"Correction God does not tempt us, the devil tempts us. Now God will test us. <br>James 1:13-15 NKJV
<br>[13] Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. [14] But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. [15] Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.
<br>
<br><br>I Thessalonians 2:4 NKJV
<br>[4] But as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who tests our hearts."
We all need to pray the lies of the enemy come to light for this man! That the Father opens his eyes to the truth that this is indeed a sin! The enemy has him so blind! He needs prayer!
As always Christians twisting their scriptures to suit their misguided beliefs. Thank GOD FOR ISLAM WHICH MAKES EVERYTHING CLEAR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR TWISTING VERSES. GOD IS ONE WORSHIP HIM ALONE HE IS NOT A MAN NOR CAN HE DIE OR BE BORN ESPECIALLY TO A HUMAN AS A BABY.
I'm glad you took the time to talk to this young man who is not a pastor or Minister.   I don't know why he would call himself that he's reading the books and taking what he wants from it😮 God doesn't change his words cannot be misconstrued we all know what God meant and means and what he teaches we are to live like that and not make judgments against others we can't tell them that for sure they're going to hell but we pretty much know if you're not living by God's word you have to pay the price😊 just be willing to pay that price❤
"“Don’t you realize that those who do wrong will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don’t fool yourselves. Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality,”<br>‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭6‬:‭9‬ ‭NLT‬‬"
The caption in your thumbnail is offensive. Noboby in the video said anything like this
He is going to be very surprised shortly.
"God doesn't tempt, the enemy does!"
Repent or go to hell
"God is not the author of Confusion 1 Corinthians 14:33. I pray this man finds the true and living God and turn away from sin, because the wages of sin is death. Romans 6:33"
The patriarchal view is a modern interpretation that did not exist at the time of Paul.
😂😂😂😂
Hell🔥👹 awaits all gay people!! 💀
He’s literally tryna justify a sin .. how foolish
"I want to make a point. I think Brandan is wrong in what he believes and I agree with his opponents. However, I <b>do</b> think there are a couple of occasions where they're missing each other and he is possibly being picked up wrongly. What with slight breakups and delays in sound on the Zoom platform, I think clarity of the discussion is suffering.<br>He's also either being misunderstood or misrepresented @ 10.26."
"You cannot take the Bible out of content like that. You cannot take what fits youand twist it and leave what does not relate to you. Whether it is in Jesus time or our time, God's word remains the same yesterday, today and tommorrow!!!"
He doesn't want to understand the truth.
Blasphamous
"I feel sorry for Brandon, who is struggling with homosexual temptations and committing a sin condemned by God. It’s not easy, especially when you are young, to deny yourself and embrace a life of celibacy. As a Christian, it would be better for him to humble himself and acknowledge that he is a sinner, just as we all have sinned. His attempts to find excuses and twist the Bible, leading others astray, only deepen his fall."
"“Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. 14 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."""
It's not just the sex relationship with their friend but they want to spread it to all society. Sodom and Gomorrah didn't just happen that one day. It was a social condition that got worse over time.
Wellcome to Sola Scriptura.
"What homosexuals can't understand is that the word of god condemns ALL perversions. Within those perversions, homosexuality is one of them."
He's a false preacher I hope God opens his eyes to the real truth and turns him away from his homesexual sin. <br><br>I was bisexual until I was 18 and then gave my life to gave and now I have a wife and daughter. God saved my life from destroying that sin from my life. <br><br>It's simple what does man don't lay with man mean it's not that hard to understand. It's common sense
this isn't a debate with a pastor. this is just a debate with some random gay guy
"What this guy said at @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=555"">9:15</a> pisses me off. What do you mean you are not sure how that works? It seems he is saying ""You are a sinner so you studying the scripture must be incorrect."" DUDE YOU'VE BEEN THERE! You started from a faith as small as a mustard seed! That comment was so unnecessary."
This man is not  a pastor. He wants to justify  his lifestyle. He can tell himself this lie and argue with these guys. He will not be allowed to argue with God and if he is convincing others that this his view will save them. He is guilty of leading them to hell.
"God said in revalation not to add or take away , not to change any of the Word of God!"
So if you live under the law of God then you by the word of God you die and not enter in heaven. One way to heaven through Christ and He is not Gay
As a pastor you a held more accountable for leading people astray.
God bottomline is a God of order
It’s not your point of view
So why was Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed?
For what he thinks is not right its written in Bible 3 times that gay is sin so why justify it if it was the plan of God to create homosexuality it would produce babies these are the persons who harden their heart so much that they dont hear or obey the Spirit of Truth. Therefore lust is not love lust is hate but worse. ✝️
I like how when he wasn't winning he tried to cut them off multiple times
"Lots of people have temptations.  It's our duty as Christians to resist and to do what we can to encourage others to resist.  Judge with righteous judgment, but judging alone isn't enough, you must help lead them from their strayed path."
How is the pastor? Gay isn’t homosexuality kind of forbidden in the Christianity world and I can tell the pastors a little bit ego
I have never seen someone try shard to justify their sin. Gay sex is wrong period.
Freakiest pastor ever 💀
"This gay ""pastor"" is leading his congregation to hell   If you go to his church run out of it and find a faithful church  a church pleasing to God"
Homophobics love their sin and will justify their sin. Real christians silence homophobics all the way
🏳️‍🌈🌈🏳️‍🌈🌈🏳️‍🌈🌈 its who i am 🌈🏳️‍🌈🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈 asexual
"I am Catholic, so I don't agree with Dr. White on everything, but I'm so glad he's combatting heresies like this. Glory to Jesus!"
"For his ""interpretation"" to be even close to correct requires accepting that marriage as directed by God in His word, equates to the wife being the chattel slave of the husband."
"😅 so if 2 men are married and have sex to make a baby, how does that work when it comes to actually producing LIFE.... NO life can come from 2 men! therefore death!"
"Well, then you simply don't believe the Bible. Just go, and do what you like. But you know you're wrong so you try to twist the Bible, to approve what you're doing."
"There are no gay christians. You might struggle with some past inclinations, but you can't continue to engage in those activities and be a christian."
"Evil will arways defend itself by claiming the higher moral ground.  Christ was cellibate, not gay."
"He's a Gay pastor 100%,.............. in the Church of Satan."
"""I reject what Paul has to say"".<br>Ooooooh....you getting a letter my guy."
"Needless to say, this gay pastor is being deceived by the spirit of Satan and using him to also deceive his congregation with his false teachings. As GOD destroyed Sodom & Gomorrah because of all the immorality and evilness from their homosexual lifestyles and community of perversion."
He rather serve his flesh and pride versus God
Delusional
"Look at him helicopter around in that seat, he clearly knows he’s wrong but if he admits that then his entire weak foundation from which he has built his wicked empire will be wiped clean and he can’t handle that truth"
"It is funny, the same people try to use the gay guys argument to support women teaching or being a pastor over men, and they fall flat on their face like this guy did.  The scripture says what it says, if you want deeper understanding, meaning you looking up the original words in Hebrew or Greek and you understand just how severe and blunt it can be.  When you defend sin or heresy you are on the wrong side of eternity.  Period."
the young man needs god
If same sex relationships were ”natural” and men only had “sex” with men..then the population wouldn’t exist in 100 years. How is this so hard for homosexuals to grasp? Same sex is NOT natural.
👍EXCELLENT!!!!!!!
"young man are you arrogant? Do you enjoy being what you feel is above every other human who is gay.? Why are you so focused on Gay relationships? ITs not just desires, it is who we are, Do you make money off God here on the internet? Maybe no sin is different than another as the bible says. God is forgiving and loving. He knows us you don't. He knows the reason we are struggling you don't. I wish you could love all people really. God will not send us to hell because everyone would be in HELL. There is not one perfect!"
"1 Timothy 1:10, Leviticus 20:13, Leviticus 18:22"
"acting on gay desires is a sin. but so is lying, or having hateful thoughts or a trillion other things. we all sin practiticlly all day every day. The problem is not doing the sin is denying that it is a sin. which means you aren't repenting."
"Poor soul, he is very lost. I hope God helps him."
You lost me at “gay” pastor.
"It’s an interesting debate, but protestant ism is basically Catholicism light. The true faith is in the eastern ancient church,  the orthodox church. The very centers of Christendom that Paul planted himself."
"Homosexual lifestyle: GRINDR, circuit parties, nightclubs, bathhouses, orgies, PREP, vanity.  <br>I lived that life for nearly two decades.  <br>Jesus said to deny ourselves, pick up our cross and to follow him.  <br>There’s no justification for homosexual physical relationships—period."
We do not know But he did hang out with 12 men
"Be VERY careful with James White. He's a false teacher as well bro, I'd love to show you if you're interested at all."
God and scripture is the standard for truth and morality. The subjective opinions of heretics leads to humiliation.
"2 Peter 3:16<br><br>[16] as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures."
"I see people quoting James 1:13 in response to your misquote. I think I know what you were trying to say,<br><br>""All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not leading to death."" - 1 John 5: 17
<br><br><br>Some sin seems to be an opportunity to refine your faith before non believers in order that god may be glorified in your suffering. <br><br>I pray this comment speaks the truth from god and any error is counted on my part."
Ok Mr Gay “Pastor” aka Satan
"SODOM, Lust Saturated going in the name of love THE LIE incidentally the Strong Delusion from God off the prophecy,  so all that believe the Lie should be condemned CAUSE THEY HAVE NOT THE LOVE OF THE TRUTH <br>The Strong Delusion from God revealed through the SODOMIC PRIDE LIGHTING of the White House by Caesar the RIDER OF THE WHITE HORSE OF THE APOCLAPSE <br>For the reason warned Jesus "" Remember Lots wife "" not just to Sodom but COMPLACENCY towards it, that caused Lots wife to turn into a pillar of salt,  the state that Protestant America is in today <br>Though Lots daughters had husbands in Sodom but could not reproduce while in it and their desperation became manifested when they reproduced though through incest, Reveals Sodom to be Anti Reproduction so Anti Family against the basic order & truth of Creation <br>Render unto God what is to God FAITH,  without which it is not possible to please God but surely not a Leavened/Corrupted Faith as in Protestantism's Faith Only <br>Render unto Caesar what is to Caesar  SCIENCE <br>So Faith & Science compliment each other <br>But when Caesar demands/pushes/Legalizes Sodom & its Unions that has no Scientific (Genetic) evidence other than Circumstancial (not admissible in a court of law) it amounts to a clear rebellion against God <br>The Result :: THE STRONG DELUSION FROM GOD <br>Bible : Fear not the ones who harm the body rather fear the one (God) who can both kill the body & destroy the soul in hell"""
America is worse than Sodom and Gomorrah
Gays were norn with a reprobate mind ...... If people really read the bible they wouldn't be gay
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=175"">2:55</a> gay goblin looking ahh why they all who say lgbt is not bad are like goblins"
"Wait, is he arguing an “exploitative relationship” with a woman is just fine?"
"Not sure why these guys would even humor this fool.....Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. There was a point in the beginning creating a woman and man. Pretty cut and dry, even IF you didn't believe in the Bible. He has a mental issue and needs therapy, not to mention the obvious.......Jesus."
No such thing as a gay pastor
I would not like to be in the place of this guy at the Last Judgement
"Genesis 3 with the serpent, “Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?” <br><br>From the beginning the father of lies has been twisting scripture to fit lies. To say scripture is only significant with its time period means  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=790"">13:10</a> Brandon can’t be a pastor of a church, and a body of Christ(granted, he isn’t a pastor nor is his congregation a church). <br><br>When Jesus said love your neighbor in the synoptic gospels he only meant that in the first century not in the 21st century. Therefore the Bible is inadequate, the logical fallacy of irrelevance or irrelevant reasoning. <br><br>Though clearly in Hebrews 4 the author says “For the word of God is LIVING AND ACTIVE, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.” <br><br>The word convicts us of sin, we are exposed before God as fallen because of his word in verse 13. So, to make it less convicting and the weight of sin, less “weighty”, we discredit it and use fallacies to support our false pretenses. Or I’ve seen people say abortion is ok because God killed his own Son 😞. <br><br>“The heart is most deceitful above things and desperately wicked, who can understand it?”<br><br>“Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.” <br><br>When your mouth speaks lies and twists scripture, you’re no better than the demons who have a greater level of faith than a false professing Christian( James 2:14-26)."
The gay pastor is just looking for an excuse to continue living in sin.
"When i see the gay pastor. I see satan laughing behind his back, so very sad"
This alphabet soup person is a heretic! I am sick that YouTube  allows this offensive offal on the channel.
"God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. End of story. Any more arguments on this topic is easy foolishness"
"We can acknowledge a gay “false” pastor … but there’s no such thing as a “gay” pastor.   Just saying, that’s anti biblical."
"Gay pastor, that's an oxymoronic statement. He is just twisting God's Word to suit his demonic lifestyle. He needs Christ and the true knowledge of Christ."
"With all respect,  the real problem here, and overall in the American church,  is that Jaiden, Brandan, Dr White, and Jeff have one thing in common....None of them ever succeeded in the world, as a believer, before becoming famous.  It is almost 100 per cent of all popular Christians.  No actual experience in the world as a believer, and now they are ""telling"" us the way things are.   Sounds good, Bible accurate,  very passionate history teachers all of them.   This is why Christianity is dying in America,  people have seen the foolishness of the system, the theoretical Christians.    How mature we say Jaiden is.  Mature at what??  Knowing Bible words,  Bible history,  and virtually ZERO experience at application.     Sorry everyone.  There are a few exceptions,  but remember....Did the speaker live as a believer in the world and SUCCEED, before becoming a leader??"
That “pastor” looks so sick. His soul is ded and he looks ded. It’s fascinating.
"Wow , corrupting the word of God to suit his life choices , not sure it works like that"
You can’t change God’s word to fit your own agenda. I pray he and others realize this before it’s too late. Pray for them.
God isn’t gonna anoint somebody that’s gay to preach satan disguise himself as an angel of light this so called pastor is lost and is heading straight to the lake of fire but he believes he’s heading towards heaven he needs to repent and stop twisting the scripture to make himself and all other gays comfortable we need to pray for him I ain’t writing this post to condemn that’s not mine or anybody’s job online God is the judge but the guy is wide open on the wide path
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=646"">10:46</a> this argument is an interesting one to take up. Homosexuals can’t procreate, therefore they don’t bring life. Neither does remaining single or being infertile, yet this is not condemned as sin or criticized by the church. I think they make a lot of points that are hard to argue with in the Bible, but I don’t love seeing this argument being made"
You guys interrupt too much. Not a good look homies
Homosexuality produces something Gods wrath
One man one woman
It’s disgusting 🤮 gay is wrong
Gay marriage is wrong
"Theologians, aren't they part of Catholics? So then their both wrong in their beliefs, and is infact hypocritical when he said to not bring outside sources of the bible, when Catholics openly admit that the seventh day is the sabbath but they changed it to sunday without any scripture, and only based on their own power, power they dont have."
Any sex outside of marriage is sin. Marriage is between a man and a woman under God. Case closed
yk what the problem here is? he's GAY
Itching ears
The homosexual man finds himself in a morality trap when he gets in a discussion about the word of God and knows it this come through when he won't answer the question straight up but is forced to  and then trys to give an in material explanation to a in morrow act it's this behavior that gives him away and shows he knows it is wrong but now he is trapped into satisfying his flesh the carnality of this world inorder words he is addicted just the kind of thing the devil wonts to see from person now he can drag him down to hell unless this yong man can find  salvation
"I'm kind of relieved that this is a Protestant issue, a ""priest"" arguing in favor of same-sex marriage in a Catholic Church would not be taken seriously and would be excommunicated. I'm Brazilian, and to us it's insane that you Americans have gotten used to seeing pride flags in churches and let them say all sorts of heresies at the altar."
People forget that you do have control over your desires and what you like or don't like
The gay pastor is living in sin and an imposter.
Wow that false prophet looks like an undead being.
"I feel sorry for the young guy because he is sincerely deceived. He found a couple of arguments to justify sexual perversion. Sex is a gift and has a purpose. Same sex perversion is clearly spelled out in the Scriptures. Pray that this young man gets set free and repents of his sins, and that he gets emotional healing."
All I’m hearing is “ I don’t identify as an idolater “ like sir just cuz u reject it doesn’t mean it’s false … when u are an idolater u cannot WORSHIP God which invalidates his credibility hence why it’s so easy to reject it . He knows what he is doing . Wolf and sheep clothing for sure .
Homosexual relationships do bring death. The bible doesn’t talk about your life it talks about all life and for life to continue that requires a man and a woman to create generational life. Two men or two women can not create generational life. Even if you consider adoption they aren’t bringing generational life they are advancing a bloodline that is not and can not be their own. Adopted children from all families whether they are same sex or not will wonder where they come from and will seek out these answers and if you can introduce the adult adopted child to his or her own parents later in life it will always give them a sense of joy. <br><br>They may have a negative interaction and never look to see thy heir biological parents again but knowing is closure .
When people start saying the “context” you know they are not servants of God.
Blaspheming my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ makes me sick. It's demonic anyone with the holy spirit knows the truth.
"Bull sh-t, what an ass"
"I hope you grow up "" dude"""
Why would people say this? You dude are a fool
Praise God
I love to quote Luke 14:33 to these traditional Christians and see them do exactly the same things they accuse LGBTQ affirming Christians do.
"the alteration of something from its original course, meaning, or state to a distortion or corruption of what was first intended.<br>""a scandalous perversion of the law""<br><br>Anything that does this goes against Gods law. That includes homosexual sex. Gods intention for man in his original state was that Adam and Eve have relations and children. This was perfect love. If you want to know the truth just see what the Jews currently believe about homosexual sex. They are against it and put it in the category of Adultery. Anything outside of a Jewish marriage is adultery. This is very clear. It is a sin. It misses the mark."
what app they use to read the original hebrew words
"Your doing a good work, keep up the faith. And love for Gods children"
The fact a gay man was allowed to be a pastor is blasphemous in itself. God condemned this behavior and said it's punishable by death! False prophet
"It IS within your control. I am expected 1000% to deal with my overwhelming cravings for drugs (when I was first saved).  We are expected to deal with urges to cheat on spouses right? What man doesn’t lust after a woman other than his wife occasionally? But are you going to say he can’t help it, poor guy it’s just who he is! Nope. We do not make excuses for any other sin the way we do homosexuality.  As Voddie Baucham said, he doesn’t believe people ARE homosexuals.  It’s not an immutable characteristic like being white or black. There is the act the Bible calls sodomy.  People choose to commit that act.  Now the perverse desires is something we have to hand to God.  IF you are born again, you are a new person.  New heart and mind. A regenerate person.  Brandon has obviously been deceived into believing he has been saved but how can one be saved when they have never acknowledged their own sin, and obviously not repented of it! On the contrary! He says scripture isn’t infallible, and God loves homosexual relationships and teaches countless others this heresy without conviction! He may be reprobate at this point.  You can not give passes on certain sins and condemn for others! Will the church now accept child predators? They will say they can’t help how they feel as well! So do men who beat their wives who just feel angry all the time! Who commits sin without FIRST “feeling” that need to? The heart is deceitful above ALL things and desperately wicked! Who can know it?  Our hearts lie to us! We have to trust and rely on scripture! NOT what we feel! That’s why we are told we must die to self daily and pick up our cross and follow Jesus ! These people aren’t willing to sacrifice anything for Jesus! It’s their way or no way.   We should pray he has the truth revealed to him."
"He said if ya read it like you do sure! It sounds like a broad condemnation of ALL gay sex. Insinuating that some gay sex is not a sin, correct? Well since marriage was defined BY God as between one man, one woman, that means two men or two women could NEVER be married. Right? And that means ANY sex between two men would ALWAYS be sexual immorality! It will always be a sin because same sex marriage is not a thing! It doesn’t exist to God! We could allow a man to marry a tree or squirrel (by our standard of marriage, give them a certificate of marriage etc) but that doesn’t mean they ARE married in the sight of God! There is not one example where two men (or women) can have sexual relations and it NOT be sinful! In short, since marriage isn’t an option, sex isn’t either!"
"I watched the entire video and at no time did I where Brandon was ""humbled"" by anyone. He's a very smart and eloquent man who handled himself very well in this discussion."
"I will speak on myself as a woman who has lust toward women and desires for women, I think it’s easier on me bc I’m not fully attracted to women I am incredibly attracted to men, but I know what the desires and temptation is like. I will say this; the more you give yourself over to it, the easier it becomes to delude yourself into thinking it’s okay and God will forgive. “Well even if I act on it God will forgive”; repentance literally translates to “TURN AWAY FROM”. If you are actively giving yourself over to these temptations, you will fall victim to the mindset that God can move past it. Our God is CREATOR, his law is JUST. Just because we think he’ll forgive, do not convince yourself that his law falls apart bc of it. He only forgives in times of active repentance.<br><br><br>I will also add on, I am now about to turn 23 this month, I got a porn addiction starting from fourth grade. Within all those years I am proud to say that God held me fast and I have never once been physically intimate with a woman. I praise Jesus for it but I will also say to anyone who has, I do not judge you I do not condemn you. I just pray for you and I pray Jesus can give you peace and forgiveness for yourselves."
"Yea, Jesus literally  said, no sex before marriage and marriage is between a man and a woman but Jesus is gay. That is ridiculous."
I think he needs to get more simple. God said be fruitful and multiply and you cannot do that in a same sex union.
This pastor is off his flipping rocker!!!! It’s so twisted!!!
The Old Testament also stained people but we don’t do that anymore
"Doesn't the bible clearly say being homosexual is a abomination of God,why debate with them."
"It's not controversial being gay it's a sin,stop the nonsense."
Bro tell me that gay pastor don’t look like paranorman as an adult
“Paul has a patriarchal world view” … this gaay man is delusional
This is not the right way to carry a debate. You have to let the other person talk too even if you don’t agree with their position.
I'm sorry LGBTQ is not a very controversial... They're just gay. Who cares. They're just trying to make something out of nothing
Why are we watching a 14 year old kid listening to a debate?
"Hi! Gay Christians DO exist :3 they're still saved. Why? Their saving faith in Jesus. Their desire to serve the Lord produces visible fruit in their lives, a Testament to their salvation.<br>They're not going to hell just because they're gay. That idea is simple human judgment."
"Paul strikes me as a total solophobic homo, and voyeur. Physiology is not like temptation, you must be joking. Try putting down the Book, and speaking to Him directly. He is Alive, seeing and listening right now. He will show you, if you only ask, and have patience. He plays a long game, and doesn't do magic tricks. He performs miracles, great and small, for those who allow Him. His great Love knoweth no boundary!"
"Literally the definition of changing God’s word to fit your own agenda.  I mean, at least have some strong facts and reasoning behind such a deviation."
"If God wanted for men sleeping with men and woman sleeping with woman he wouldn't have created ADAM And Eve so shut up with your stupid answers , I wonder if the old your co is a  speaker is the man or the woman in there relationship."
It's plainly unnatural. Even animals knows its wrong<br>Tribes in 3rd world countries agree this is unnatural. <br>An abomination
He is doomed.
I’ve never in my life heard of a “gay pastor” what blasphemy is that?
The only loving committed relationship God approved of is marriage. Which is between a man and a woman. He does not support boyfriends and girlfriends. This is a very simple concept. There’s no argument to be had.
Gay dude completely fails at logic
"I've been struggling with same sex attraction my whole life.  We can argue all we want. But all we need is the Holly spirit dicerment to know the gay pastors is wrong.  Trying to justify your sin with words is just not going to work. I've tried for years, but the truth will set you free"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=648"">10:48</a> after asking the question 4 times and watching this boy squirm and wriggle to avoid it was quite funny. You can see his intellectual dishonesty on display."
What do you mean he has desires he can't control? This is wrong.
"Brandon might have studied the word of God but he is far from living the word of God. “Talk is cheap, like daydreams and other useless activities. Fear God instead.” -Ecclesiastes 5:7"
"you are a true thinker from the Word, you have compassion for the sinner. may we all have the same desire to pray for the lost."
"REJECTION of GOD's Words is a dangerous thing! That may be the reason why they keep trying to twist the Scripture the best they can and becomes worse in their part. ""Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things."" (Romans 1:22-25)."
"Young LBGT pastor  you still have a lot to learn.  You are twisting the Word of God.  Yes, look what happened to Sodom & Gomorrah .....    you are teaching the Word of the Father of Lies (Satan).   Praying for God to open the eyes of your understanding.  You are trying to justify your sinful lifestyle.  You are totally false. The question is:  where do you want to spend eternity.  It s where you want it to be."
"how old is this red head in the smaller window.   mudder flucker, he can't be over 16.   And he's going to tell us what the fluck is going on.   omfa"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=841"">14:01</a> God doesn't give us temptations, it's our sinful nature and free will. James 1: 12-15 ""12 God blesses those who patiently endure testing and temptation. Afterward they will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. 13 And remember, when you are being tempted, do not say, “God is tempting me.” God is never tempted to do wrong,[a] and he never tempts anyone else. 14 Temptation comes from our own desires, which entice us and drag us away. 15 These desires give birth to sinful actions. And when sin is allowed to grow, it gives birth to death."" It's not in God's character to tempt us, he's not setting up schemes to see if we will give into our sinful nature. He knows we will because of free will, that's why Christ dying on the cross in forgiveness of our sins is so important."
"Sooo… when God created woman, was God thinking their sons should be having sex with sons? Why didn’t he create another man instead of woman if that’s the case"
Is that Jamal Muhammad White?
"He does not worship God. He worships his own god, his own created god based on his twisted understanding of the scriptures. To get anything they want they will twist the true Word of God for a lie. This is classic sin justification. Blind man. I pray that God strikes his heart with the fear of God. I pray he wakes up and opens his eyes to see the Light of Christ. Amen 🙏🏻✝️"
I bet he thinks sex with animals is okay too.
"The Bible speaks about this, and warns that man will attempt to twist the meaning and interpretation of Gods word in order to fit their own agenda. So not only does this sadden me how lost that man is, it excites me how close to the coming of Jesus Christ we are."
"These people can't seem to understand that our Lord only wants whats best for us. Its exactly like when your parents give you rules. No one is trying to take your ""fun"" away, just make sure you're safe."
"The Bible is literal. It is not complicated.  He loves his sin more than God, just my opinion."
"This was excellent but God does not give us temptations.  Satan gives us temptations. Christ allows it because of free will and also hopefully conversion.  Jas <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=73"">1:13</a>  No one, when tempted, should say, 'I am being tempted by God'; for God cannot be tempted by evil and he himself tempts no one."
"The fact that these LGBTQ@TB+2XYZ ""pastors"" disregard Paul's teaching while still holding to anything the Bible says is ridiculous. Either you believe the Word is God-breathed or you don't. If you don't, then you don't know God. <br>This is the same argument I have with non-Creationists who say they're Christians. I'll defer to your ignorance, but after being exposed to the truth if you keep hold of the lie, then you undermine the entirety of the Bible."
His demon is showing. I pray that his eyes are opened before its too late and repents.
"Even if you weren't sure whether or not something was a sin, why would you risk going to Hell for eternity off of that? We all have to deny aspects of ourselves. Gay people aren't special."
Listening to this debate is absolute proof to show why Christianity is doomed
That's why Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed!
"Hanging a Pride flag in a church is comparable to when the Phillistines brought a statue of Dagon, the fish god into the temple. We all know how God responded to that. 🙄"
"If Paul’s teaching was affected by his embracing of the patriarch, is there any scripture where that doesn’t occur?  How do you know anything about the faith, if it is corrupted to the point of rejecting the person who wrote most of the NT."
Everyone is sinful including pastors... The difference between regular pastors and this guy is that they don't base their identity around their sin....<br><br>You are the devil sir
bro called james white a “well seasoned theologian” 😂😂
God himself calls it an abomination..
😊 dude you done for.
"Alright I came across this and am actually saddened but it’s also a strong prayer point for all of us as Christian. The devil is seeing revival in church and making sure to penetrate it as well. Well before we go very far Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because of same sex marriage, now am hearing this like gay Pastor.. like how can you put the two together? He studied the word of God but didn’t allow the word of God to change him. There’s no such thing as gay Christian. But God can change anyone. I pray that that guy encounters God. Same sex marriage is spoken against throughout the Bible! Guys it’s a prayer point for us, let’s pray for that LGBT community that they encounter God."
"If the gay pastor is a practising sodomist, he has  no business being a pastor."
"It’s seems harsh but God will be harser. Some religion’s cut peoples head off😢but the Christian,s go in and tell them the truth and we all know truths hurt ❤ and we all try and justify and make it fit but some things doesn’t matter how hard u try it just doesn’t fit x"
Seems to me the sin of Homosexuality is Pride…sound familiar
"AS a human..... Christians are more focused on SEX being a sin than anything else in the BiBLE or church. They use the scripture to make themselves feel better. You mentioned ... MONEY , Fame and PRIDE as sin but yet you are here on this format trying to become popular and make money. All sin is equal and there is not one worth of the kingdom of heaven but you all think just because you are not HOMOSEXUAL you are automatically going to heaven. NOPE GREED and corruption will send you down the same road as homosexuality. If you believe in the torment of hell and that God would actually send those he loves to Hell. Would you send your child to hell no matter what they did. ? Of course not so then how much more can God love us being GOD! Common sense is what God expects us to use."
Lord give me understanding in Jesus name Amen
"It is simple, a straight man not staying true to his nature is a sin, a gay man going against his true nature is a sin."
"Correction "" God does not give us temptations""."
"I'm not sure Brandon was ""humbled""..."
"This Robertson guy is brilliant, thanks for introducing him!"
Simple example <br><br>God burned the Sodom and Gommorah for their sexual immorality <br><br><br>Man having sex with another man
So gay its disgusting
That’s not a gay preacher! He is a false prophet there are no “REAL” preachers that are gay
These is definitely demonic
Why is a woman so horrible to a gay man? I don’t understand are they repulsed or what? All women are repulsive? I want to understand
This gay pastor will pay an even higher price for his lies and deception
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=542"">9:02</a> Can feel trough screen that he is doing this for himself. No relationship with God or wish to know him."
One is not Christian another one barely is
Crap!
"The gay pastor is not a pastor. He irks me to no end. He is leading people straight to hell, and he will be there!"
Gays think everyone is gay. Wishful thinking.
Christianity is stupid
Edomites are satan's children god hares you romans 9.13 christ died for the children of isreal. John 3.16 cant save you read Isaiah 45.17 thats the world god loves
Edomites are satan's children god hares you romans 9.13 christ died for the children of isreal. John 3.16 cant save you read Isaiah 45.17 thats the world god loves
Why does his head move like that?
that is blasphemy may God forgive that gay pastor
Gay pastor sounds absurd
Both pastor are demonizing each other to prove themselves are right <br>This guys are shaming religion for some YouTube views
"1 Corinthians 6:9-10<br><br>9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor HOMOSEXUALS, nor sodomites,<br><br>10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God."
Why don’t you try creating your own content instead of playing somebody else’s videos little boy
A gay Christian Minister 🫨<br>that's like trying to stir oil with water it just doesn't mix.
How do you use gay and Pastor in the same sentence there is no such thing
The work of devil those who not love the truth are not from the lord
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=454"">7:34</a> Except more than once Paul elevates women to a position of authority. Like when he had Apollos taught."
"Why are yah listening to this crap, why have a debate with this fool, he wants the bible to accept his sin, your gay and its a sin, ignore him and why make a video with this nonsense"
So we just gonna sit here and act like you’re not carbon copying daily dose of wisdom?
Imagine being in an LGBT church then dying and going to hell thinking that you were living for God sad 😢
“You have no justifications for your ethical claims because you abandoned God”
Satan is promoting homosexuality to decrease the repopulation of humanity. And he will use people who deeply believe that their agenda is the truth. He is the master of deception
✝️
"""Paul is not credible as an apostle""...that eliminates half of the new testament🤦"
It is not just evangelical that believe this you clown even religion believe that
People worship as god which off course it said that Jesus is god. And they also worship Satan and call him god too the bible Cleary states that Jesus and Satan are angels are not to be worshiped basically he worshiping Satan
Why are you given this clown and platform 😅😅😅
Arguing with Sodomites is futile unless God intervenes
What a fool. Defending homosexuality is insanity
Imma sum up how Christ feels about same sex abominations:<br>🤢🤮😱
"Good debate.   I would make one correction though…….God does not give us each different temptations.   Read James 1:13.   The things that we are tempted with is simply the result of original sin.   I have no doubt that there are people who are literally born was unnatural desires towards the same sex.  When people say they are born that way I do not disagree that men and women can be born with a desire to be with the same sex.  However, to give into these desires is still a choice.   The fact of the matter is we are all born sinners.  This is why Jesus says we have to be born again.  Once we are born again he will transform our hearts and minds back to the natural order that he originally intended"
"Gay pastor, haha, is it bad to want to slap a pastor? The church has been infiltrated."
"The Hebrew text is specific to the act itself. It applies to any context you throw against it - ancient or present, exploitative or otherwise. The law condemns the act itself."
Look at what happened to Sodom and Gormarrah.<br>The LGBT have their own bible as well.
“Same-sex relationship do not bring death”<br>….<br>“They don’t bring life” 😮🫨
Galatians 6:7
"Jesus himself was bisexual and some of his best friends were gay, so what is all the fuss about?"
God help us with sexual immorality! Btw I can’t stand someone rejecting the truth like this gay pastor!
"He’s going to face one of the worst punishments in the pit of fire if he doesn’t repent, which I pray he turns around nothing is impossible with God, but dang…… he is so delulu"
So when do you fulfill: Be fruitful and multiply? Is it a command or a suggestion?
If a Pastor is sincerely preaching or teaching this then id 100% be questioning their Salvation 🤔
"And why does Gods Word say be fruitful & multiply, that can only happen with a Man & a Woman.<br>No other union or relationship can bring life or multiply which from the very beginning is how God designed the natural World & i for one am glad❤"
"No Scripture or prophecy is of any private or secret interpretation.<br>God is not a respecter of person's, He will never reveal something to one person without revealing it to other's for confirmations sake & so there's no confusion. <br>God has not given us a Spirit of fear but of power & a sound mind❤<br>The Scripture means exactly what it say's."
"“To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”<br>‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭8‬:‭20‬ ‭KJV‬‬"
The bible never stated that.
God does not tempt! <br>The false narrative of the guy claiming to be a pastor is evil and unbiblical. He’s leading people to hell because he acts upon the homosexual desire  and justifies the abomination of an act he commits and then teaches people to believe in the nonsense. <br>All that he said made 0 sense.
This is insane twisting of scripture from this self proclaimed “gay pastor.” Wow pray that Brandon comes to the truth and the Lord frees him from this deception.<br><br>I’ve also heard Brandon speak and say that Jesus sinned as well when he was speaking on “The Line of Fire” with Dr. Michael Brown.
"I get the gay pastors point on the context since tattoos are also a debated topic on whether it is sin or not because of the cultural context of the time it was considered a sin. But the thing is, later on, Jesus states that marriage is between a man and a woman. So if sex is supposed to be reserved for marriage, then how could homosexual practices not be sinful if by the word of God they can not marry."
Howdy doody look more like a man in this non-Preacher Satan Jesus any kind of fool to do his bidding
“Be fruitful “
Brandon has numerous demons in him or at the minimum oppressed. The word of GOD is infallible.
Thanks for the video. Keep up the good work 👍
Isn't it funny how there's literally no proof of people being born gay yet they claim they are.<br>Like how? By growing up in a single mother's home? By being sexually abused? By wanting to beat woman in sports?
"The lord is my shepherd, I’ll shall not want"
This is no pastor of the gospel. You can see in his face that he is not well spiritually speaking. He is desperately looking for excuses to justify his perverted way of living and can't stand being told truth.
Paul got his views from the Holy Spirit - the Spirit of Truth‼️
My question is:  What will this “Pastor” say when Jesus returns and states that being gay is not acceptable and is in fact a sin ????
You can’t worship god if you’re making a god that allows sin  that’s a different god that I worship the true god in bible does not exempt a sinful nature
"One chapter earlier in Leviticus 18, God (Jesus, because He was the God of the Old Testament) said it plainly, ""Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind: it is abomination.""<br><br>This so-called pastor comes at the Bible from a purely secular angle with his insistence on looking at the ""context of the world.""<br><br>On the subject of the errancy of the Bible, the gay ""pastor"" is technically correct, as the Bible does contain errors, <i>but</i> the primary cause of those translational errors came from the Catholics editing the original scripts in the medieval period when they sought to rule the spiritual world of Europe with an iron fist. As offensive as that may sound, it's historical. That aside, the Bible itself is the word of God, as far as it is translated correctly."
"What’s worse is my daughters high school had a Pastor who identifies as an ally to the LGBQ and encouraged the students it was ok to be gay. At the same time teachers were making my daughter remove her necklace that had her gold cross on it. They talk about creating safe spaces for these troubled youth while forcing my 14 yo daughter to remove her religious jewellery. After a heated phone call to the school turns out she IS allowed to wear her religious symbols but it must remain out of view under her clothes, even when the school wear and promote rainbows.<br>Sad when people that can’t procreate WANT TO RAISE MY CHILDREN 🤬🤬"
The amish dont even have these problems. lol
"I still don’t see why I should have no respect for someone who is gay, nor should I cast them out for a “sin” they committed, when heart-fully, it’s just love."
"This pastor definitely hasn’t read nor studied the BIBLE! The BIBLE is defensive in both the old and New Testaments. GOD is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow. The BIBLE  is the inerrant word of GOD! This it is definitely a false preacher!!"
It occurred to me a while back that the prophesied forces of darkness when we enter Armageddon are the woke…
just perverts making it up to suit there own needs
If God was against homosexuality as suggested by some Christians you wouldn’t need to nitpick verses from the Bible to prove it. It would be one of the 10 commandments. God does not care who you sleeping with but the context of why you are sleeping with them.
",,I reject that."" 😬 No offense to you bro but you reject the ""worldview"" of Paul...Who was one of the few chosen patriarchs by Jesus."
The Bible says in the end times people will look for someone to tickle the ear and tell them it's ok to sin so that's what he's doing is tickling the ears of man
"The ""community"" conflates homosexuality with regards to the church. It is and always will be a sin because the intended meaning of sex is to procreate. It's not pleasure. It doesn't mean gay are bad people. We all sin. Fact remains, if the world turned completely gay tomorrow, the human race wouldn't last very long. This simple rule applies to every single person, the act of sex is for the singular purpose of creating life. If your intention is to have sex where creation is a physical impossibility, it's sin. This ain't rocket science, folks . If I cheat on my wife, it's a sin. If I cheat on my wife because I love someone else, it's still a sin."
The greek pronunciation here is giving me autism
Can we get this redhead guy out of the corner of the screen? Lol
"Praise the Lord!!!  He has shown us all His Mercy. So much. We could all be in that place where there is no more hope. The people there know why they are there and that there is no hope.I can't tell you how many times I tried suicide. Suicide is the most narcissistic thing a person can do. They don't think how they are hurting others,  And they don't think of the many people in Hell that wish they had another day to make that decision. People in hell are believers. What I think will shock people who go there is no human or demon or Satan himself rules hell."
Sick
"It is written, ""My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment"" James 3:1"
How can Paul not be credible? Didnt Jesus also appear to Paul after the resurrection.
Amen 🙏 it’s nothing more than a perverted spirit you’ll have to pray against the flesh.
This is ridiculous
"There is no such thing as a homosexual, just people committing the SIN of homosexuality.  Bottomline."
"Just because it was common, doesn't make it right. It's still SIN."
"It is impossible to be saved and gay at the same time. Simply because, if you truly had gotten saved, you will repent and turn from SIN. Including the SIN of homosexuality!  So when someone says they are gay AND saved, it's an abomination to God Almighty."
"This pastor is lost, completely lost the true interpretation of the word of God"
"Jaiden, for a new Christian, you are very wise! Stay in the Word, young man, God is blessing you with wisdom!"
A way to know if something is right or wrong is if everyone did said behavior what would happen to our species and our world. If everyone shot heroin what would happen to our world opposed if heroin didn’t exist?<br>If the world only had 1 man 1 woman for life marriage compare to if everyone was in homosexual relationships….how would that world look after a generation? Pretty simple really
"I think they use God to try and hide their shame, they know deep down its very wrong! I hope he can repent so he he can see the true wirds of God!!"
God isn’t gay
"I don’t necessarily agree with either, but it’s just unproductive to shun a group of people who also believe in Jesus. Am I wrong? It seems like the dogmatic guy is pushing the other guy away. I don’t recall the 10 commandments saying anything about being gay or anything. Unite. Don’t divide."
wow!!!
"@JaidenForrrest , so obv arguing/debating with this guy wont make him change but what do you think the goal of this debate was. to prove him wrong? if Brandon doesnt come to see the err of his theology, what should be our response as Christians? do we condemn him? should we be the first to cast a stone?"
"Gay pastor, is a joke. They do not understand the  word of God. Can not be gay, and be a Christian."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=849"">14:09</a> maybe you just worded it wrong but God NEVER and I mean never tempts anyone <br>James 1:13 <br>“When tempted no one should say “God is tempting me” for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone;”"
You have prevented the Bible is a sin but as a leader of the flock a clergy man being gay opening and putting it forth promoting is a day of you don't leave your position and repent there will be a day with the Lord all sins are sins but how come this is a new thing no early church father's did this the day with the Lord will be a on your head if you don't leave this now gay pastor I'm a sinner maybe i don't suffer with that sin but pastor you need to leave and tremble at you have done
"I don't really understand problem, this ""pastor"" claims he believe in God from Bible and it clearly explain in 1 Cor 6:9-10 , that gay will not inherit God's Kingdom, and more God destroy Sodoma and Gomorah for this sin."
"Something that all three of them are missing, and admittedly I haven't finished the whole thing because I'm at work and I'm watching it in small segments, but I just passed the point to where he was saying that the reason Paul believed that homosexuality was sinful was because of his patriarchal worldview. But the significant issue with this is that Paul's not the one writing in the New Testament. He's putting pen to paper, but they're the words of god. And let's forget about the whole homosexuality debate, if we can't even agree on that, then we need to be having an all-around different conversation."
"""I reject that"" as if you and God are equals, free to disobey His commands at will without facing any consequences. Would you mind rejecting the sun rising each morning? Tell it not to shine on the earth until you've had enough sleep. If not, it is impossible to reject a single Word from the Bible and still hope to have a positive relationship with God. <br><br>""So shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth: It shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it."" Isaiah 51:11. The same God who said ""let there be light"" and there was light, said ""the soul that sinneth shall die."""
"Jaiden, you poor lost recloseted boy.. No amount of church or scripture will ever help you.. Shame.."
"God does not give us temptations. Satan places temptation in our thoughts, in our vision, in our emotions. It is then OUR DECISION to act upon or reject them. This is the confusion Satan has created to cause so much division. GOD did not create us with these temptations. Our enemy, satan,  places it in our thoughts.  That is why we must understand how to use the Armor of GOD.  JESUS did not leave us weaponless against the enemy.  We make ourselves vulnerable the moment we tolerate  other people's sin because we struggle with the same sin."
Sodom&gomora. Does everyone remember that tale? Sulfur&brimstone raining from heaven to destroy the twin cities of debauchery and corruption. As they were fleeing; if they looked back turned to salt. Ye the young goof is a heretic....
"If you really know God and love Jesus, the Holy Spirit would guide you as the what is right and wrong in your life. You would just know, you would just feel it in your heart. Maybe He has shown you before but you were not willing to accept it and instead choose to please your fleshly desires instead. By doing that you are rejecting God and He shall reject you also.<br>Repent!<br><br>It is an abomination to God.<br>Leviticus 18:22 ~ You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination.<br><br>Leviticus 20:13 ~ If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them.<br><br>Jude 1:7 ~ Just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.<br><br>Romans 1:26-28 ~ For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.<br><br>Genesis 2:24 - Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.<br><br>Mark 10:6-9 ~ But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ ‘Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two but one flesh.

defining scripture seems like a very important thing to do here. and i believe that one must be very careful in doing so.
"Great video sir! Keep up the good work, continue to speak the truth. You added lots of great points at the end. Have an awesome day!"
"Brandon has to presuppose his own worldview in order to make his interpretation of Scripture consistent, this is the error of Eisegesis that all who willfully sin use to justify their habitual sin."
"As soon as anyone brings up patriarchy, they already lost"
parody of a pastor. why even talk to the guy? dont think Paul would have entered a debate with him. just think about it!
Wow!  This false pastor clearly twists the Word to fit his presuppositions
Of all the sins in the Bible were told to pray against and rebuked lust is the only one that we are told to flee from
"this is not even suppose to be debatable, it's just pure justification for their movement, to hopefully be accepted, fortunately, they won't ever get the acknowledgement they ever seek."
There's no gay pastor 😢
"There is something wrong if this doesn't profoundly grieve your soul - but instead produces hatred in your heart.. you need to rekindle your compassion for the lost... Lord Jesus, if it be Your will: free this man from the grasp of Satan and draw him into your Blessed arms..."
"The very fact that he HAS TO ""justify"" his beliefs.... is all the evidence he should need as proof that what he is doing is SIN.  If he were to stand in front of Jesus and ask Him what He thinks... does he honestly think that Jesus would justify this.  If that were true, he wouldn't have to justify it... God's word would clearly explain it for him.   He KNOWS he's incorrect.  He just doesn't want to see it."
"See...here's the thing, Mr. Gay Pastor.... ""I don't believe that"" is not a relevant argument.  What YOU believe is irrelevant .... the only thing that matters is, THE TRUTH set forth by GOD.  YOUR ""beliefs"" do not trump what GOD'S WORD says.  It's plain as day.... the Bible says that a Man laying with a Man is a SIN.  Period.  You need Jesus my friend.  You need to pray.  Jesus commands us to go forth, be fruitful and multiply.  You can not OBEY God if you can not multiply.   You are spreading Sin.  You are saying that YOUR BELIEFS are more important to you than God's words."
"""God"" must have been gay since he decorated the world so well."
"One hiccup in the video, God doesn’t give you temptations, the devil does. God helps combat temptations. But other than that perfect video bro. i love that you’re spreading the word!"
Its crazy the amount of hoops this guy is trying to jump thru to pervert and distort gods word
Homosexuality destroys life. Men can't get pregnant and you raising kids will not bring life.
"He keeps saying ""it seems, it appears, but the context...."""
And what did he do to the dity of Sodom and Gomorrah? He destroyed it because when you do that God says you pollute the land.
that's right Men lusting after Men is wrong!
Men/Emperors made it a common practice to sleep with 10-11 year olds does not make it right.  They were ordered to do so.
There is evidence of Egyptian men with men DRAWN in the caves of Egypt and I'm sure in CAnaan just as it was prevalent in ROME.
"The problem is that LGBTQ people want to translate/misinterpret Gods word for their own lifestyle. God is not the author of confusing. He is very specific. Do not lie man with man, woman with woman or either with a beast. God is not a man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should repent."
That gay so-called pastor is leading people straight to hell. I hope he knows that God will judge him severely.
"For corrections bro,<br>God doesn't give us temptations, it all comes from our own desires <br>James 1:13-15"
"I'm only 17 but my family are pastors and I will be frank it's not a debate it's a fantasy to believe that you will find fulfillment by a man dating another man it's just disgusting the idea of doing that if god made man and if God created woman so that man would not feel alone then tell me why is it that mam would want man, man would feel alone but if man would want woman than man would not feel alone am i right?"
What i find interesting is gay people turn to the bible for confirmation yet disregard the truth. If the bible does not matter why do they even read it?
Look I get the kid gay pastor is clearly very confused and not fit to be a pastor at all. But the real pastors shouldn't have just interrupted the kid so much. It made them look real bad.<br>And this is coming from an orthodox christian before people pile up on me calling me a heretic.
You waste time  gay go push puty
Sharia Law solves most problems.
God doesn’t give us temptations
James White finally wins a debate but did it with zero grace.
Wolf in sheep's clothing. Be careful out there
Poor interview/debate
"9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,<br><br>10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.<br><br>11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:<br><br>12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.<br>  <br>Unfortunately you are dealing with someone with who has been given to a strong delusion, He has passed the line of repentance"
God doesn't make people gay it's a choice
As a Born Again Christian I don't believe that Gay people are going to automatically be in hell but I do believe that God has grace and is just. God bless to you all ❤
"The part of this debate I don't think was done properly is how the two continue to interrupt Robertson. If someone is giving their explanation, you let them continue to speak without interruption. That is how you not only save time by forcing the other person repeat themselves, but you miss parts of what they say as you interrupt them.<br>In a debate, when you interrupt the other also shows you are not listening to the other debater, you are locking and loading words to hit them with. Therefore, as you interrupt someone you are not hearing what they are saying, you are mentally readying your word. When you do this, you miss words from your opponent you could later use as a foundation to reply to.<br>I agree that Robertson is a false teacher.<br>I have desires for wealth that is stronger than sexual urges. That does not mean I can become a preacher and twist the words in the Bible that deals with monetary riches and wealth. One who has what feels like a natural urge, but that urge is against God's word, then one must fight day and night to resist that urge. It is not to say, ""This is what I find to be natural within my being, so it must come from God, or be a natural part of humanity"", no, if you have a prohibited urge and desire, you must fight it, not give into that temptation.<br>The more you fight and resist that temptation, the easier it is to continue fighting and resisting until the temptation no longer holds power over you."
"Dust off your feet, guys. They know, and they don't care."
Man Jaiden keep going young sir. You remind me of me when I was young.
How far men have fallen from grace the rebirth of Sodom and Gomorrah has started... In the bible LGBTQ people have no place they wont see heaven for heaven is a place where the saved and the righteous will go those who have accepted christ as lord and savior.. as a Christian i feel heartache for the LGBTQ community coz they are lost sheep and the devil is using them to gain more sheep to the damed ..but God is great i believe that one day they will be saved i hope they will be saved coz in the end they will burn in the eternal flame
They where doing that in Solomon and gour that's why God destroyed that city
"Leviticus 18:19 is in the same chapter as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=1102"">18:22</a>, but Christians ignore the former while condemning the latter. Yet, God calls both abominable.<br>I've also heard Christians speak against drag, but excuse watching Mrs. Doubtfire as entertainment, when Deuteronomy 22:5 doesn't give that kind of caveat. So when it comes to immorality, Christians are making excuses to justify what they do, and we need to repent and agree with God."
"The Bible clearly says 1 man, 1 woman. Cling to your wife. God made them to procreate. 2 men can not create a child. God made our parts to fit together as a puzzle in order to have children. All creation proves that. Gay sex is an abomination. God did NOT create us gay."
Y r u gay! 😂you are gay😂
Sorry obviously living in denial Christ was Never a sinner and obviously never Queer
Dems single handedly pushing the Trans Agenda if you don’t like Men dressed as woman in schools and men competing against women don’t vote Democrat their policies push for the Trans crap.
I truly hope this man repents and knows Jesus does still love him even in his sin. I had a good friend fall completely away from Christ when church told him Jesus hated him for being gay. Instead they should have continued to nourish his relationship with Jesus and let the Holy Spirit do what it does and change his life!

"Nobody is free of sin, not even a priest or pastor, bit I think you should at least know youre sinning. Im sinning as well everyday, like every other human, but I try as far as I can to see it as a sin and in my head I know Im doing wrong"
God has already warned this Cult teacher once with thunder yet he keeps on blaspheming God and His word. His church is of the devil not in The Body of Christ.
All the pastors that are misleading homosexuals and tell them it is ok to be gay will be hold accountable before God.
"These poor fools who try to make agreements for their lustful actions, are blind as they can be.  I hope, and pray God will show them the truth, and they will repent.  Then they will be welcome into the Kingdom of Heaven ."
James 1:14-15 our desires lead us into sin. Thank you for praying for Brandon. He may be our brother someday.
repent is all i can tell you and i will pray for you
"Foolishness….One of the reasons Sodom and Gomorrah was doomed is because of homosexuality. Ask him to read it. Also, Paul would never promote sexual immorality."
God have mercy upon us 🙏 😢 🙌 😪
Gay pastor. 😮😅<br>How is that even possible...
"Some should ask him please..”God created Adam and Eve right, so if God created Adam and another Man, would he be here today?"
He’s just gay not a pastor
He has to be so demon filled that Satan would give him literature to corrupt him.
"God knows about man lusting man that's why the verse there, bcs it happened since hundred years ago! God hate it! And this ""gay pastor"" said it's okay?!! he don't know the words of God 😒🙄 praying for his soul!"
"How can gay becomes a paster in first place when on earth , don't spoil our holy bible don't belongs to LGBTQ at all"
Blatant rejection of God's word 🥲🥲🥲
Go woke go broke Pastor
"He's correct that you have to consider historical context. Hermeneutics are INCREDIBLY important. But not in this case. It applies moreso in cases like when Paul writes to Corinth and directs women to be silent in church. That appears ONLY in that letter, despite him having written to many other churches. The reason is because in that specific church there was a female-only pagan cult that involved screaming and ripping each others clothing off and having orgies. Many young believers in the early corinthian church attempted to do this practice at first, so basically Paul was like: ""No no. That's bad. Don't let them do that, better to be silent than to cause disruption of that kind."" That is hermeneutics, this is just justification."
Do these gay pastors preaching the word of God realise what they are doing in front of God and in His house
So why would Paul have a patriarchal view… when he just said it was normal for same sex partners to practice homosexuality?? So would Paul have a different view??
Roman 1:26-27.
"The Apostle Paul is such a mighty tool in the hand of God all false teachers and false prophets like Muhammad, Allah and Islam hates Paul and tries their best to discredit his apostleship. They go after no other apostle than Paul because he addressed everything pertaining to faith, church and relationships etc."
I honestly did not get the Gay Pastor's Point.
Peter warned in his own time people were misunderstanding Paul and twisting his words to dismiss his teachings. We are now dealing with 2000 more years of those purposeful attacks on Paul’s teachings.
I believe 🤣 paul is a more prominent figure than this gay pastor false teacher
Thank you for posting this! God bless you and your journey in the ministry God has called you to fulfill.
"It's exactly as Apostle Paul says, hence the reason this gay ""pastor"" is a reprobate! Poor guy😮"
Sodom & Gormmorah was destroyed  by  fire with this kind behavior ..... immorality...
Wolf dressed up as sheep
"Wow this Guys didn't even know what he's saying, You can also apply Matthew 19:7 in this issue, God created a Man and Women for the greater purpose, and this guys perverting the OT and NT just to fit with their own prejudice and biases. Even i can fully understand the contents of Romans 1:37, even though my mother tongue isn't English, even if you read it by verse or in context its message is undeniably about the same sex marriage."
A little off topic. But where does the Bible say he'll is a place of weeping and gnashing of teeth?
"Find your identity in Christ alone. Galatians 2:20 NIV - 20 ""I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.""  It is difficult to die to self, but that is our calling. Matthew 16:24 NIV - 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, ""Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me."" When did Christians stop denying self? Can you be a disciple unless you deny yourself? There is no other Gospel than the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus and our identifying with Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection. We need to be free to our self and flesh addiction. This is a growth process and there WILL be stumbles along the way. Hear the Word of God: Galatians 5:16-25 NIV - 16 So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. 17 For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want. 18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 19 The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; 20 idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions 21 and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. 24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 25 Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.

"Wait question!!!?being gay without sex? Is that lustful. I have friends who are gay but never have sex, is that still lustful or sinful?"
Be fruitful and multiply
Is this young gay pastor cherry picking to suit his lifestyle... how much of the truth can you explain away ???
The manipulate the HOLY BIBLE however they want and teach everything on their own ways. I hope they no longer have the voice to even speak at all.
The guy is loving and trying to justify his sin… I think I’ll go back to my porn addiction… not
"Bible says beware of sheep in wolves clothing. <br>He is miss leading people and he will stand before God on that and be judged. <br>Pray his eyes are open to the truth and see how many lives he has destroyed with the lies.<br>The devil comes to kill, steal and destroy."
Did the false teacher just call this guy a false teacher ……..
Gay pastor is like having a vegetarian vampire

God bless you young man of God. May God bless you and your family tremendously and bless you in your ministry!
I don’t really find this interesting because that pastor is making up his own views and picking a choosing what he wants to hear. Any semi intelligent person or even someone with any common sense would see this so called pastor is ignorant. Jesus loves everyone and I pray this pastor really does find Jesus!
"Ok all this gay “ pastor” is doing is trying to hide his sin misinterpreting the Bible to fit his narrative so he doesn’t feel guilty , I did that before when I was in the “lifestyle “ which btw it is exactly that because it’s a choice  we have our own will God doesn’t force nobody to believe in Jesus"
"“The heart is deceitful above all things, And desperately wicked; Who can know it? I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, Even to give every man according to his ways, According to the fruit of his doings. jeremiah 17:9-10<br>'Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! ' 'And see if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!' Psalm 139:23-24"
"It literally says in 1 Cor 6:9-11 list out those who will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Romans 1:27 is clearly written. I highly recommend that you don’t “debate” people who claim to be Christians but don’t follow what is written in the bible that’s like a someone who say they are a lawyer but don’t follow the law. In the end, all this have been prophesied before our time and this only confirms again that we are living in the last days"
"That gay pastor don't know an inch abt Jesus !! He is seeing him through a gay lens - that is wishful thinking, not facts."
"This Gay Pastor is blinded by Lucifer. That is why he can not see the truth and start twisting the truth just like his father Lucifer and does not want to be liable to their actions.<br><br>That is the problem when Lucifer wanted to be God, Lucifer started to have his own interpretation and started to tell the whole truth. Lucifer is trying to inrrupt the moral ground by telling the half truth to justify his own agenda."
He doesn't want to give up or admit his sin. He's trying so hard to keep it.
"I can't deal with ""educated,  knowledgeable"" adults, they are impossible"
1 Corinthians 6:9-10
This just blows my mind.This is why this world is like it is.Please help us SWEET JESUS.
"""Diapers"" was not such a bad introduction.... but Brandon is so dumb, my pet puppy is wittier than him. 🤣😅😂😂😂😂"
Which one is gay? The other guy talking other the bud does help
"Gay rights and acceptance turned into a whole different scenario than just wanted to be respected accepted and given the same rights and heterosexual people. It’s like they want to rewrite everything in the world and make it gay, trans, or bisexual! Just live your life and be done with all these false narratives."
you do not have the Eucharist so check yourself
"""Be fruitful and multiply"" God wants the relationship to bring life and multiply."
"If he doesn't believe the Bible is ""God-Breathed"" then he can think it means whatever he wants it to mean."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=598"">9:58</a> They don't bring LIFE! 😂"
"I don’t even understand why this is even a debate. <br><br>1 Corinthians 6:9 “9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind.<br><br>Simple if you don’t submit yourself to God’s word you are on your way to hell"
"Römer 1, 26- 28 Homosexuell is a Sin."
"So if it's only pertaining to demeaning relationships, then why doesn't it say that for women too? This dude is starting to sound like a misogynist 🤣 it specifically says ""as you do with a woman"" for a reason, which is DONT have ANY relations with the same sex 🤦‍♂️ Maybe lesbians can get away with twisting the words, men don't get any wiggle room 🤣🤷‍♂️"
The hubris! These people need to admit they don't follow Jesus and just start their own religion. God would probably have less wrath for them in the end 🤷‍♂️
This gay pastor knows he’s wrong! But the elites have him in they church to confuse and destroy for $$$
"The narrator is right on target!!! You get it!!! FROM A non practicing gay senior man!!! Because I accept the TRUTH( WORD OF GOD) I DO NOT RATIONALIZE IT TO FIT MY FORMER SINFUL BEHAVIOR!!! GOD'S WAYS ARE BEST FOR HUMANITY! KUDOS TO THIS YOUNG MAN WHO IS NARRATING THIS DISCUSSION! WE ALL GET STUCK WITH SOME FALLEN NATURE! THATS LIFE!  IT IS A SPECTACTULAR JOURNEY, BUT WITH GOD ON OUR SIDE  IT BECOMES EVEN MORE INTERESTING  AND CHALLENGING!!!"
May God bring His marvelous light into this young man's life.
Jesus was sinless. He did not give in to temptation.  Jesus became righteousness and sacrificed himself for us so we can be right with God.
🌈🌈🌈🌈👏👏👏👏
"Bruh you just earned my subscription. Btw this gay teacher is evil from another level. How in the world are you gonna defend being gay, when the Bible is clear in MULTIPLE texts that you are not supposed to be gay. Like come on, step down from ur high horse, and continue your sin cause ur not gonna change ur bullcrap, but don’t try to use the Bible to justify ur sin, he is what the Bible would call a fool."
"Gods first commandment to man and one he made a point to elaborate as his most important command. ""Be fruitful go forth and multiply so that you may have dominion of the earth sea and air"
"I wish these supposed pastors would stop leading their followers straight to the gates of hell, evil evil evil"
"God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!"
Temptations do not come from God
He got himself backed into a corner and started spitting out anything he could think of to claw his way out.
"The Word of God,is from Jehovah God.Not Jesus...."
This young guy is very refreshing
"The answer for this gay apostate/heretic is the CROSS. End of story. He doesn't want it? Move on. Dust off your shoes and move on. I have no time to waste with a closed heart. I will tell him the Gospel, encourage him to embrace the cross, tell him to repent and leave that nasty ""alphabet"" choice, and if he says no and tries to get me to see his lies, I move on. Very simple. It's all spelled out in Romans 1:18-32."
"I feel bad for this old man. We need to pray for him. God is not this hard to figure out. He may need the holy Spiritt to reveal to Him because he clEarly cannot see or hear Gods word that’s for us it seems so crazy he doesn’t even see himself trying so hard to have others understand . He is lost and that’s okay. We were all lost and then we were found. We should pray for this gentlemen. I pray he has a supernatural encounter it is revealed to him. There’s no point in arguing with someone this deep. The fact he is still going on and doesn’t see this as an idol is crazy. If there is anything you wouldn’t give up to include Abraham and even his own son, then it’s an idol. Jesus can ask me for anything to include my life and i would lay it down! ““Don’t waste what is holy on people who are unholy. Don’t throw your pearls to pigs! They will trample the pearls, then turn and attack you.”<br>‭‭Matthew‬ ‭7‬:‭6‬ ‭NLT‬‬<br><br><br>The word of God IS Jesus , he thought he had a pun there! This attack of the devil is real!"
"To be clear, God is not the source of temptation nor our feelings, passions, or desires. God through scripture calls us to confirm our hearts and minds to Him, the principle of which is expressed in Psalm 26: ""Vindicate me, Lord, for I have walked in my integrity, And I have trusted in the Lord without wavering. Examine me, Lord, and put me to the test; Refine my mind and my heart."""
The Bible Says Adultery itself is a sin. In fact its one of the Ten Commandments. No one gets Singled out and condemned for having sex before marriage. I think its wrong to bash people for their sexual orientation.
.
Funny how we don't see many aged homosexual couples. Maybe they're on to themselves by then!
"Problem with his argument...Jesus was working through Paul so discounting his work to further and CORRECT the churches faith, informing and teaching so discrediting Pauls account is discrediting any form of wisdom given and taught."
2 areas where same sex failed<br><br>Rome <br><br>Sodom
Gay apostate* not pastor
"No such thing as a gay ""pastor"" minister of satan, yes"
"What do y'all expect? He's the same genius who tried to twist ""Lazarus, Come out"" and use it to make it seem the Lord is encouraging delusional sexuality confused people to  Come out😂"
He looks like an actual talking satanic goat to me
The fact that he reads the bible to twist it's teachings and not even realizing how bad of a path he's going is terrifying. <br>God will hold the sheperds to a different standard than the sheep.
The blind will lead the blind
I am so worried for people. So many people are lost. The world has deemed acceptance as love.
"All he says is "" I, I, I, meaning he is the god of himself, and  for the WHOLE alphabet people."
Pastor Chocking be Back
Ok The Gravy Done Boiled Down TO THE ONIONS TO THE GAY WORLD MY PASTOR WAS GAY PASTOR YES SON WHY YALL GAY MEN CHOOSE GAY A GAY BEHIND AND NOT A. WOMANS BEHIND ITS THE SAME THING WHERE THE BOO BOO DOO DOO COME FROM
"Him purely focusing on the context is another logical phallacy. If everything ever said was taken at face value, we would learn nothing. If everything was only focusing on context, we would learn nothing. There has to be a healthy blend of those 2. He only looks at context, and therefore misses the literal meaning of the verse. Also, every other direction in Leviticus specifies the subject of why the action is sin. If it meant that the idolatry was the sin part of homosexual behavior, then it would have said so. It would have said “If in the action of idol worship, a man were to lay with another man in the same way as with a woman, it is detestable” then yes, but it doesn’t, it just says that “If a man lays with another man, it is detestable.” Ignoring basic meanings of words. Sin is bad, God is good, and we need to love those outside of the fold with just as much love as those within."
"I had relations with ""trans women"" which is basically men, and i knew it was evil, wrong, unholy. I lived in sin and enjoyed it, but i will not justify my evil ways. What i did was pure evil, period. There are no if ands or buts. The God of Abraham hates the sin i committed. I spat in the face of God and crucified Christ. No excuses. If i be forgiven, may it be in Christ."
This is how the devil works. Pretending to be of God and perverting the scripture. If it was ok it would be blatantly stated in the Bible. The Bible is crystal clear. It is about tattoos also but everyone makes excuses for them too. It’s so sad that these preachers of false doctrine have no accountability for misleading vulnerable people.
"you know years ago priests and pastors had to go to through rigorous tests like a doctor or a lawyer before they can: teach, preach, Baptise and present Holy Communion. The 12 Disciples were taught for 3 years by JESUS. Before they went out preaching. How much more do we need our pastors to be trained in the word!!! Years if not decades! <br><br>Don't get me wrong I have nothing against young pastors. I myself am 25 (Not a pastor). But 80% of them just want views, money, fame or to sell a book they wrote or merch. Seriously!!!  No! I am sick of pastors telling sheep to read their bibles but never get through a book of the bible just one line per sermon. <br><br>I read a book about a pastor in China who read whole books of the Bible in 3 hour sessions. Book of Matthew! Done! Book of Luke done!!! True teaching! Then the next day they would go into more depth about the notes they gathered. Talk and really chew the words in their minds. It is rare to find a church like this today! Not adding their spin on it but taking it as it is. <br><br>I'm not talking about believers. I'm talking about the people who teach the believers. Jesus said he will judge them more harshly. In the Book of James it also says this. It says not everyone should become a teacher because they will be judged more seriously. We need people who know the Bible inside out and who can quote it word for word. Who tries their hardest to obey it. I know nobody is perfect but there are Good and bad christians. Wise and foolish christians. Jesus said ""not everyone who says,""Lord,Lord"" will enter into the kingdom but those that do the will of my father!"""
"Homosexuality is a sin. Black and white. There is no wiggle room. Just like murder is a sin. Lying is a sin and also being proud. You know many different sins, but virtues are things like chastity, purity, love, marriage (man and woman) Truth, Humility and you know what else is a sin? Corrupting and adding or taking away from God's word."
Yes Brandon is a false teacher just as we were warned of.
No such thing as a “gay pastor”.      That would be a deceiver and a fraud.
"Like Jackie H. Perry said, ""Eve judged the tree by it's effect. It looked good, It's gonna taste good so it isn''t bad"". That was bad descernment and bad wisdom. We judge by what God has said about something through His Word"
"I wish that the LQBTQ community will come to the realisation that God doesn't hate them. He loves them. He only hates the act of same sex.<br>I wish that they will come to realisation that yes all of us is bron out of sin. Some of us is môre broken than others and we dont have control over that. But thats why we need Jesus to set us free from sin , to purify, restore and heal us"
"If Paul the apostle is wrong and the text of him is false , throw your Bible out the window because that means the whole Bible is corrupted. And in fact that’s what the ppl do! The justify themselves to God , which we know hell fire awaits those you want to justify themselves ."
"In the old days they would unalive the gay pastor . Truthfully just based on context and evidence, he would not breathe after they judged him . They would have done this from Leviticus to the time of revelation and prob up until the last 80-100 years"
"The devil also used the word of God against Jesus. Satan twisted the word of God, this man is twisting the word of God. He is no teacher of the word, he cannot even follow the world and he is rejecting these ideas from the Bible, meaning he is rejecting God"
He looks really sick like he’s lacking iron he doesn’t look healthy
Always love hearing the made up dribble he spews
"2 Timothy 4:3-4 “3 For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 4 They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths”."
"God does not give us temptations, he allows it. “When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed.” (James‬ ‭1‬:‭13‬-‭14‬). Those temptations are your cross to bear and leave it at the feet of Jesus. Other than that good video!"
I agree with them but they also continuously interrupted Brandon and were twisting his words. It was disrespectful in my opinion.
"So if either the woman or man is unable to have children, are they forbidden from sexual relations?"
God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah for it and we’ve forever known your sinful abomination as Sodomy ……but but but but
there’s nothing wrong with being gay. we all have temptations. it’s the act of what a gay person participates in. marriage is between a man and woman
You can’t argue with a fool.
A false prophet
What about the physical appearances of lbgt people?  They have Free will and choice but how can they deal with organs of both gender.<br> eg.  Hermaphrodite etc..
There is no such thing as a GAY Pastor. This child is not a real Pastor.
Gay pastor is an oxymoron.
God never said there wouldn’t be temptations( and the temptation is from satan )however we are to resist the temptation and live according to God’s will.
"It's weird how people are afraid of this Lake of fire. I even hear kids call themselves satans and they are all going to the Lake of Fire. <br><br>Our souls are more powerful than the Angels, they become deprived when we enter into this world and sometimes trapped here forever in a never ending sinking into endless simulations. <br><br>When you worship the True God, heaven earth or hell will not be able to harm you, all these things get rid of impurities. Gold gets revealed when it enters into the fire, even Jesus chosen to head into Hell, his whole path and life was to get to Hell as soon as possible. Then, he escaped and walked on the earth for 40 days asking for meat to eat, then ascended and the witnesses said the same way he ascended is the same way he will return. <br><br>He wasn't afraid of Hell, why are all of you afraid of Hell? The children reflect their Father right, if Jesus was not afraid of Hell, and you are, that means your father is someone else, someone fearful of Hell, someone wishing to avoid Hell and run from Hell. I'm more afraid of the True God than anything else, nothing else scares me, because I know the True God can make anything a Hell or Heaven, it's not a destination it's a condition of the soul, imagine being in heaven deprived of anything to enjoy it with, your basically a ghost a hologram. <br><br>The True God is beyond the Bible and all Religions, all Religions are dependent while the True God is not dependent. :)"
It's so sad how this guy is justifying his sin and leading others away from God in his false teaching.
So sad
They're interfering against me to have a heterosexual marriage and did so.<br>They divert and attack with interpretation about context which is false.
"I am a republican Christian and do not support gay marriage, that being said, it gets old hearing everyone hyperfocus on gay marriage and homosexuals far more than any other sinful act because in doing so the church is turning away millions of people from god. We are all sinners and god does not hate their sin anymore than he hates your sin. I believe we should preach the Bible and everything in it, including homosexuality being a sin however I don't think we should emphasize homosexuality more than any other sin. If the church would stop primarily focusing on gay people I believe many more people would be led to God. Christianity isn't meant for just straight people. Side note, the gay pastor is completely wrong in his teachings and is being sacrilegious taking the Bible and twisting it to his own desires. He is dead wrong, but that doesn't mean the gay community deserves god any less that you or I."
These people in our society today are horrible false teachers who don’t worship the true Lord. They do not know Gospel in need to repent and turn away from there sin immediately. He has no clue what he claims. The Bible is anti LGBTQ and it’s horrible these false teachers who the church trusts today. We need to stand our ground and know the truth.
Thanks for sharing. Good job and God bless.
God loves us all as his children and so do I love God and all. Dear God bless us and have mercy on us🙏😘💕
Im so tired of Christians saying homosexuality is a sin. I read the Bible and consider myself a disciple of Jesus but I will never be a Christian just because you segregate perfectly healthy human beings thinking your book said it’s a sin. I agree with the pastor. Exploitative and promiscuous sex is wrong. But two people of the same sex can be in pure love and calling it a sin is just ridiculous. I won’t get baptized because I don’t want to be like Christians. I just want to be like Jesus. You make this beautiful religion divisive with this arguments. I’m so disappointed. Jesus would not allow this judgement against gay people. We need to love them not condemn them. Enough with judgement. Pray for them and leave them alone.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=590"">9:50</a> how does it not bring death when if you can’t produce offspring by the same sex, don’t you think that would lead to a huge problem world wide? 😂 god designed it to be men and women so we can procreate and have life."
This kid is good.  Glad to have you on board brother
The word is the word. Period. There is no mixing of words. It's plain and simple.
Gay Pastor? what a paradox.
strange doctrinal conflicts.  We were warned of this by the apostles that in last days there would be an increase of doctrines of demons.  I see this so-called pastor demon possessed and teaching false doctrine and twisting scripture to permit sex with same sex that is clear is against God's law!
"The church has always re-interpreted the canon to make it more fashionable and acceptable to each generation. For example it was once quite normal to follow the Bible in dealing with slaves (Numbers 31:17-18), witches (Exodus 22:18) and worshiping other gods (Exodus 22:20). Commenting as an atheist, it seems to me that logically you either obey the Bible to the letter, or you ignore it completely."
"It is NOT against God to be homosexual, I know I AM the Holy Spirit the third member of the Holy Trinity. Paul and Moses was against t Homosexuals NOT God. Amen. 🙏"
Calvanist saying he is preaching a false God. And it's true. But Calvanist believe in a False calavanist theology also. So they also are following a false god.
"Amazing, JLP 🤣😅"
"""GOD'S WORD and ""HIS!"" LAW....Are ""NEVER!!"" to be (Contradicted) nor be made (Controversial) by ""ANY!!"" Man ♂️ (nor) ""ANY!! Woman♀️GOD is ""CONTINUOUS!"" WITHOUT END....

Water and oil don’t mix ……………..
This dude must have 2fathers because his talking 💩
"Gay pastor keeps cutting them off mid conversation, getting angry , lmao bro must’ve never read James 1:19-20😂someone get dis man a Bible expeditiously"
"It's odd that they didn't push back against the argument of patriarchy by pointing out that our relationship with Jesus is framed as a bride (us) and groom (Jesus), and the groom goes and builds onto his father's house to make room for us."
I hate channels like this that sit back and watch somebody else do all the hard work in having a conversation and then they pass it off as their own by make a comment every now and then.
It is logic vs feelings.. nowadays feelings are more important... 🤦🤦🤦
"No matter however the LGBTQ affirming Christians or non Christians argue, there is no such thing as same sex marriage, regardless of what the government(s) say/approve! Cos marriage can only be binding/consummated through the act of heterosexual intercourse in the eyes of God. That is why the Bible says let no man break apart what God has brought together, and that is why it says a man shall cleave to a woman and they shall become one flesh. And that is finally why homosexuality is an abomination in the eyes of God."
That kid is so uncomfortable  and his demons are very active <br>Because he keeps interrupting the pastors<br>I don’t consider this young person as a pastor
That's the big error many people make. It IS in your control. The fact that you struggle with a strong desire means you have allowed the flesh such a strong foothold on your life that the strength of your Spirit cant break it. This leaves you open for the devil to use you in the flesh. In the Spirit you Are able to control it. But it costs much prayer and selfdicipline to come back to walking in the Spirit better.
"This is outright blasphemy and a satanic lie.Jesus is holy and will always be holy.This atheistic inundation of vile rhetoric against the Trinity(God the Father,Son snd Holy Ghost) is an evil agenda being promoted by those who despise heterosexuality and godliness."
He is totally blind..
"Jesus also says, If a man LOOKS upon a woman to LUST after her, hes commited adultery in his heart.  Adultry.  I congratulate you all for having this conversation but we all nees to look at our own sins really hard, myself included. Our Eternal Salvation is no joke."
Jesus sat with sinners. He didn't sin with them but called them to repentance
"I honestly can’t even understand how someone can be gay and Christian at the same time and call themselves real. It’s unbelievable. The Bible clearly says not to practice homosexuality and it is a detestable sin. It is mind blowing how they call themselves Christians. DO NOT believe in what these gay “pastors” say. Do not subscribe to the ways of the world, but turn to Jesus. Christ is the only way. 🙏 🙏 🙏"
"No. We did not watch them go head to head. You edited out almost the entire debate.<br><br>That’s dishonest and manipulative, so, I’m sure it’s some sort of sinning"
What can you expect from a corrupted mind

"All she needs to do is to stop drinking so much wine, and stay silent. Because she’s pretty dumb."
Probably the main reason no sane and sober person is voting for her.
Hell who can afford Doritos or clubbing in the fkd up economy
She's lying about the friend. Special K moved to Canada when she was 12.
Clubbing with Diddy
There is only 1 kind of guy that will vote for her🙄
Nothing but how she grew up and no answers to any of the questions she is asked!!
Swapping her for Biden is  🤦‍♂️
Crooked Media
"They are thinking, Answer the Question!!!"
😂😂so much content so many answers on her policies. <br><br>Look she is pretending to be middle.  She is far far left dont be fooled by the Doritos and napkins.
The RACE IS NOT CLOSE. ITS A TRUMP LANDSLIDE. THE NWO WILL USE A CYBER ATTACK ON DIMINION AND BLAME IRAN. THEY WILL ALSO TAKE DOWN THE GRID. DARKWEB GOVERNMENT OPERATIRS ARE ALREADY PLANNING IT. STOCK UP IN EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR A MONTH. THE DEEP STATE NWO WILL NOT ALLOW TRUMP TO TAKE OFFICE AND WILL TRY AGAIN. TRUMP ISNT A CAT.

She is not a leader. We need a strong leader.  Her and walz do a waltz around a question. They don't answer the question? Not my vote....
On the edge of World War three and this is our possible President even right now?!
Lmao
She acts like everything is a f*<b>***</b> joke has to laugh at it
The problem is it plays well with the younger voters because she is being fake trying to act likable. It's just like a parent who doesn't discipline because they want to be your friend. Part of why we are where we are today.

You can tell democrates bought and paid Social Media News. Just look in Kalama back pocket.
The dogma and poison of male supremacy is very real. Kamala Harris 2024 💙💙💙
Trump will LOSE this election !!!!
Kamela Harris is not the right person for the job of American President. Or any job in government. Apparently she hasn't done well with any job in government that she's had.
She's just confused over which one she should fellate first.
"Forget men, even women find her cringe😅"
Cringe
Trump 2024
This woman’s laugh ( or whatever that is) should be enough to show people that she is not presidential…
GAG!
Walz thinks it's a good idea to have napkins around too. Feminine ones. In the boys room.
She’s trying wayy too hard 😂
"Oh, wow, now she's a cougar 😅 Well she has the looks to be one.  Esther Tryus  loves it when someone is asked a question, and they just laugh.  That's street sense. Your intellectual hypocritical geniuses wouldn't know anything about that.  😅 Cougar! 😊 🕊"
She’s a laughing clown. There is no level playing field.
Fox News is a joke
Ive been alive since 1980. Never have i seen a president run on the premise of being relatable. Its absolutely pathetic and the democratic party should be ashamed of themselves. TRUMP 2024 ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Such a fake!  Joke!
boooooo Kackala and she  suckd at everything being in charge almost 4years😢
"Oh I watched part of this interview!! It was so silly (as usual).... I think the clubbing comment, was so tacky and insulting to the interviewers! You could read their faces.... they were just like ""for real?"" LOL. She tried to be ""extra"" fake black on this interview."
These beautiful men are so much smarter than Kamala! ❤❤❤
Comrade Harris needs to go home! Enough already!
What does Doritos have to do with our election?
I could care less about your doritos. Omg seriously
"She said DOE RITOS 😆 🤣 😂 SHE IS SO F.S."""
She is such a phoney.
She reminds me of the women who treated young guys badly...just because.
"Doritos?! Who is she trying to win over? 13 year old boys? Does she really think ""ordinary people"" absolutely looooove Doritos? How condescending is that?"
Close race ?  the media lying !!! Fake news!!!!!!

Only the dum vote for  this kamala
"She can't answer real questions, only Dorito questions.<br>Very sad. <br>She lost my vote in the first period."
It’s a Hillary playbook - remember hot sauce??
Original was taco flavor
I'm so sick of hearing her laughing. I don't know what to do.
"Harris is a dang fool. Where are Biden and Harris during this war ...Oh on the phone monitoring it. After visiting the border for 20 mins, she's handling that well too."
She is so fake.
Sick😡😡😡
She never answer's the question
Cackling nit wit 😂
The guys she's speaking with reaction says it all.
"Progress insists you hold the line, lest doubt drag past paths back into view. Consistency breeds certain faith that forward lies your due."
Kamala’s best poll work was in Willie Browns private bar.
"Trump 2024❤❤❤forget Harris, waste of time"
Everyone needs to be fact checked. <br>Trump 2024.
"Fake, fake, fake, and fake."
"She is failing miserably.... Yikes, man, them ninjas are getting paid to interview her... Who are they foolin?????"
censors continues with youtube if truth don't fit their narrative.
I just saw a picture of you and Diddy in the tub together sooooo. Yuck
"Russia, China, Iran and North Korea are shaking in their boots."
Watch Candace Owen’s as she proves Scamela is not black
Sorry kamala you haven't appealed to young male voters in at least 13 yrs!
There going to pack you off to war don't think for a second it's not so .
She's such a case!!! All she does is cackle and laugh about everything
💯❤AMERICAN ALL RED FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA = 535 ELECTORAL VOTES FOR PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.
Super cringe  and clueless and incapable to care for America  and serious matters
"💯❤PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE SUPER WIN ELECTION 2024 AT 8:OO O’CLOCK NOVEMBER 5, 2024 WHEN NEW YORK & PENNSYLVANIA IS RED BABE KAMALA."
"Parents, if she wins your kids are going to Iran 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
She is so fake and evil!!
"""May not be the right person for the job""MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE JOB!!!!!  SHE SHOULDN'T BE A KINDER GARDEN TEACHER MUCH LESS PRESIDENT,  STOP BEING SOFT ON HER."
So cringe 🤮
Kamala Harris is SO tiny!  Hahahaha!
Red red red red guys .........too simple ......vote red down the line
Must be nice to be able to afford a bag of doritos. The rest of us starve
So SAD to see this as a prospective president. Frankly it's quite nauseating the way she's on her own bubble laughing like cringe the whole time. To be our president is  NOT FOR YOU HARRIS!!!!  Get a grip Lady!!!! Pay attention!!
the shred continues.  her word salad never has dressing on it.
I’m a 39 year old white guy and I cannot stand her!  I already sent in my mail-in ballot for Trump
Good thing she can afford Doritos on a middle class income.
"Imagine that you saw her résumé without her name, gender, or race.  Imagine that you read a transcript of one of her interviews or speeches.  You would never think for one second that she is a viable candidate for the office of President of the United States."
"It's kind of sad, really. She didn't actually ask for this, she was thrown into it, but isn't qualified..."
"Kamala shredded Trump in the debate. Just like she is going to do on Nov. 5th. Real, true American Patriots don’t vote for insurrectionists."
"kackle, kackel, kackle"
She was raised in the middle again… but that doesn’t answer the question.  Such a fake candidate.  People aren’t stupid.  Wake up America 🇺🇸!!! Vote Trump!!!🔴🔴🇺🇸🇺🇸
No one cares about her upbringing and family... enough!<br>What about american families and the crap her administration put us through these past 3.5 years????
In this video Kamala is wearing a $63 thousand dollar necklace from Tiffany so how hard does she really have it?
Never Comrade Kamala!
"I had never heard of the ""All The Smoke"" podcast before this. In the clips that have been circulating, I see them ask her a serious question and she just wastes their time with a BS non-answer and they just let it stand. They've earned zero respect and guaranteed I'll never visit their channel. They belong in line behind Emhoff and Walz."
"I'm so confused as to how half the country thinks she's the best option, it fries my brain🤯"
Notice how it's always the same handful of trolls defending comrades harris and walz
walz:::::: the coward of the country. sung to the tune of well you know
A boxing match😂
In her friends father's Cadillac Seville ....... gee my parents had a Ford Ltd and a dodge dart swinger. <br>Her eliteness is showing 😂😅
Where are the tough questions???? Kamala Harris is absolutely pathetic!!!!!!!
Imagine her negotiating war & peace with world leaders. Terrifying.
FACT - scientifically proven men listen to a small percentage of what a woman says
Do you think the stories of her chewing on sweaty underarm hair are true ?  Maybe it could explain her crazy laughing.
She answers nothing
She treats this entire nomination.. as a JOKE
Middle income Seville
"<b>“I DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU. I JUST WANT YOUR VOTE!”</b> 
<br>– Donald Trump, MAGA Rally, Las Vegas, June 2024 
<br>
<br>One of the very few true statements Don the Con ever made
<br>
<br><b>""I know a lot about overtime. I hated to give overtime. I hated it. I'd get other people in. I shouldn't say this, but I'd get other people in. I wouldn't pay.""</b> 
<br>
<br>-Donald Trump, MAGA Rally, Erie, Pennsylvania, Sept 2024
<br>
<br>At last, Donald tells us the truth about how he really feels about American working families. Don the Con is a greedy cheapskate. He despises workers and unions. 
<br>He’s using you for your $$$ and your vote. And after he’s through, he’ll betray you and throw you under the bus. Do you think he has your best interests in mind, or his own?"
"It's disgusting how Kamala changes, her voice and her demeanor, depending on who's interviewing her with these guys she did the whole black thing we ""went to the club and her dad Seville"". She makes me sick to my stomach."
Jd vance has my confidence <br>Old tim doesn't have a clue what bathroom 🚽 to use
You can't be everything to everybody.
Cackle like nails on a chalkboard
Kamala Harris has no problems with young men and Paul's show pole dance all night long for a vote from a young man she works hard for her votes
I hate how she changes her voice to attempt assimilation. It's very cringe
Trump for president
These guys got obliterated on their comments section as the name of the podcast is all the smoke and they brought no smoke ! NBA players turned softball
She is a disaster!!!!
Major Cringe! 😖
So she's been unburdened by cool ranch. Too bad everything is still overly expensive.
… and she is supposedly ahead of TRUMP in Ga…😂🤣ok.
The dreams and ambitions and aspirations and work ethic and dreams and aspirations and ambitions and work ethic of the american people.
That laugh makes me cringe
Tampon Tim and looney harris
She a joke a joke wake up people
"In my opinion, Donald Trump is afraid to debate VP Harris because she wiped the floor with him last time. She said he’s a disgrace! One can draw the conclusion that DJT is a coward for being so scared of someone who he says is mentally challenged."
Is anyone gonna ask which McDonalds?
My wife loves Doritos...I'm concerned she may change her vote now...
TRUMP2024 🇺🇲 🇺🇲 🇺🇲 Its that simple....
"How is this news? Where do I find real, substantial newsworthy content?"
"Cool Ranch Doritos, is Black People Main Guilty Pleasure Flavor"
she cant answer because it would show her and Bidens policies are a failure...she can do something if she wanted to...but she wont
"She needs to go to swing states, get a hotel room, and do a ""sleep"" for votes campaign.  It's not beyond her and we all know it."
"They know she will ""sleep"" with anyone if it helps her make it further up the ladder.  Always has, always will - just ask Willie Brown and Montell Williams (and who knows in the democrat party now)."
"She lied about weed, she arrested 2,000 people for marijuana as D.A. in California"
"What's up with Clinton and Harris, both wearing pantsuits?"
These guys are showing the Oprah cringe..
Tapon Tim gonna get his A$$ handed to him!!!
You can tell Kamala Harris is lying when she laughs as she's trying to explain whatever question is... Does anyone else see that? 🤔🤔
This is coming from a candidate that says 18 to 24 voters are stupid..
Cringe 😬
"These guys are REACHING BIG TIME, Doritos and Clubbing, she must be seeking attention from younger men 😂. <br>What a joke"
Cringe 😬
I thought she siad young adults were stupid
She’s so irritating
"Surprised she didn't whip out a Mountain Dew, good lord"
Why does she always talk about food and cooking? Middle class childhood memories and all of the sudden assumed were stupid because she's allowed to avoid questioning that we the people who she has served poorly in the past almost 4yrs can't answer a direct question with real information of her plans to take care of the damages she is responsible for in the first place?
The men who where interviewed her sounded like they wanted it over
You can tell how staged and fake this was and the amount of jump cuts in the full thing was truly horrendous.  The fact it's even been revealed they even had a teleprompter she was reading from. As for the CBS debate you know they've already leaked the questions and scripted answers to Democrats as CBS is bought and paid for like the others.
Walz is the Richard Simmons of politics
Do you agree Trump should be dictator for life in America
The Raygun of politics...and she doesn't eat doritos! Pulease!!
no fake person should ever be in the presence of these two guys. They're as real as it gets.
She nacho your president
"Now that Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris, does this signify a potential path to the first female president of the great USA? Or does she face an uphill battle against Trump?"
Maybe he ll wear her earrings.
"""NACHOS CMON CMON OLD SCHOOL GOTTA KEEP A NAPKIN NEARBY"" - KAMALA HARRIS 2024 AMERICAN VICE PRESIDENT - CLOWN OF THE YEAR"
KAMALA SAID PEOPLE 18 to 24 year olds were STUPID and that is why they put them in dorms! REMEMBER? Fact check that for yourself!🇺🇸🙏🏼🇺🇸🙌🏼
She did not grow up middle class and never coherently discusses any plans to improve the economy that her administration has tanked
Your clowns were cackling with JD Vance while you were having sword play.
Never underestimate the stupidity of identity politics!
HURRY UP NOVEMBER WE NEED TRUMP BACK NOW!!!!!!!!! TRUMP 2024 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Talk about the draft though did she these kids getting ready for the draft go to war over and Jerusalem?
Kamala has to be the most vacuous politician in memory. There is just nothing there in her thinking. Even AOC makes more sense.
I grew up middle class… except we went clubbing in a Seville.  ?????
Any Doritos “fans” who thinks that they need to have a napkin nearby while eating Doritos are no real Doritos fans.
WW3 coming and your eating nachos? At the club?
OMGGGG 🤢
Her guilty pleasures are Marxism and the destruction of the USA.
Dude is like we have nothing.
"It is hard to imagine a candidate more unworthy to serve as president of the United States than Donald Trump. He has proved himself morally unfit for an office that asks its occupant to put the good of the nation above self-interest, He has proved himself temperamentally unfit for a role that requires the very qualities — wisdom, honesty, empathy, courage, restraint, humility, discipline — that he most lacks. Those disqualifying characteristics are compounded by everything else that limits his ability to fulfill the duties of the president: his many criminal charges, his advancing age, his fundamental lack of interest in policy and his increasingly bizarre cast of associates. This unequivocal, dispiriting truth — Donald Trump is not fit to be president — should be enough for any voter who cares about the health of our country and the stability of our democracy to deny him re-election.”"
IF YOU LIKE TO HAVE AMERICA SAVE VOTE FOR TRUMP
JD Vance called Trump an idiot do you agree
Hey Folks. Ok listen people. What is really going on here? I must ask this question too. Are we being punk’d? At least back in the day Hillary Clinton looked like a viable candidate. Kamala Harris doesn’t even seem like a serious candidate for city council let alone President. 😝
I getting jlo vibes from Kamala
Just because Biden put her there we the people dont have to vote for her !!
No human in the right mind would vote for that crap
She can't be serious
"the world does not care about your likes, dislikes and your personal life of middle class etc.... go write a book. maybe they'll read your life story.... not!!"
Convinced that she is either on meds or alcohol.  In her behaviors and speech she sounded inebriated.  Needs to be examined!
"HULU should do mini-series about her astounding rise to fame....<br>See THE AMAZING SLIDER WOMAN.....from Flipping burgers to living above a day-care!<br>Wow.! .....sign me up?<br>Yes, there will be a Sequel......""Eating Doritos in Willie Brown's bedroom."""
She doesn’t sound educated
"Kamala, America is sick and tired of hearing you answer every question about you and your life growing up & blah blah! The American citizen wants to know how you are going to help our country and make OUR lives better!! The Biden administration is a complete disgrace to this country!!!!<br>TRUMP2024🇺🇸Lets get our country back!!!!"
Trump has no chance. It should be obvious to anyone with any sense. I can't wait to see Walz embarrass Vance.
I love her❤ she will be a great president
I am nauseated by this interview 🤮
Vance has the TRUTH on his side
What is she talking about. She sounds a bit different 😬😬😬
Kamala how you gonna make America great again well i love a bag of Doritos😂😆 you cannot make this stuff up🤣😆 another meme by this fool
She was NOT. Everything out of her mouth Including McDonald's was a LIE.
She has 80% of the young vote. You guys are so desperate. 😅
"As soon as she lost, she will not do any of those accents again! lol"
This woman is pathetic!
She's so bloody childish
"I was up in the air over my choice for President, but I do love Dorito's! 🤣 Trump2024!"
Basketball players only appeal to the young people of color demographic. White guys don’t really watch the nba anymore
"So stupid, the original were taco flavor"
Omg
She is a Maoist & the last person we want in the White House.  That goes double time for her running mate Walz!!
She is annoying and the cackle is cringe.
"What is holistic government??? Tinctures, herbs stones etc….which ones end inflation… wars… the border????"
This is ABSOLUTE CRINGE😬🫠
Harris go home your evicted from our WH
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Kamala Harris is not prepared to be the President.
We cant afford doritos but glad she can
"I have met only one guy, a neighbor who claims he's voting for Harris. I'm not totally convinced as he was standing next to his gf at the time. Every other guy is standing with Trump. And I live in NJ."
"The ticket of stolen Identity and stolen valor, Harris and Walz."
That interview made me sick 🤮
Kackles laughs while hurricane victims suffer
the young males arent worthy
“I was born a middle class NBA player.”
Clubbing?  She never ever was clubbing except MAYBE showing up to one then standing there and leaving.  Cringe ... if she was actually clubbing it would have been made public to shame her if she again actually REALLY CLUBBED!
Was any of that true
She's weird
Even more reason Americans MUST NOT vote for Kamala Harris!
Does she ever talk about anything that matters or say anything intelligent? EVER?
"Many men claim to be str8, but let’s be real, they only find a male candidate appealing 🙏🏼"
"Please people, don’t vote for her if you care about your wealth and country"
Fox News is unbelievable you stand behind a liar always criticize the Democrats when will they do their job and look at it impartially
Kackle
We are on the brink of WW3 and she’s laughing about Doritos 😩 God help us
"Old persons like me have a bs radar,  too."
What a joke 😊😊😊
Joe Concho's facial expression tells it all!!!!
She is a phony !
She is a joke
Never anything important she talks about
TRUMP 2024 🇺🇸
Vance should do well
She’d rather talk bout her Doritos & clubbing like a teen instead for a 60yr old instead of stepping up to help those affected with hurricane. That’s her pleasure. This speaks volume of what she’s not qualified.
And l thought Bidet was terrible.
"She kinda stopped for awhile, but that cringe annoying laugh, is back in full force!! 🤮"
Her mother bought a 1.7 million dollar home .. that’s now worth 18 million today does not sound middle class to me.. pls do your research she wants to sound as though she relates to the average American but she doesn’t .. its all a lie!!!
Trump save America  please!!
Cring is Trump and Vance.
❤️🇺🇲❤️MAGA❤️<br>❤🇺🇲❤️ ❤️Trump-VANCE 2024❤️<br><b>Abso-HOLISTICA-lutely</b><br>❤️🇺🇲❤️
What happened to her accent again? It is not reliable that you pretend to be my group and someone else group when seeing different people
But KH they are not cho's
Born in a middle class family!
Really what a joke 🤦‼️
Its shocking that she likes Doritos? Got anything else there Joe?  <br>The only thing cringy is JD  Vance and the way he would like women to be treated like on  the Handmaids  Tale.<br>He will be put in his place tonight
"Leave your democracy better than you found it, vote her. The Republican women are the ones who will decide this election, don’t let them take your rights away…..we are not going back."
I'll never eat nacho Doritos again.
Another puff piece for kamala
Facts is all were interested in not her lies.
her voice gets on my nerves..she doesn't know how to talk professional
Story telling clown
Our country is falling. She spent more time with them than the border.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPM4x_mz9Ik&t=274"">4:34</a>  on the other side, there are millions of videos for donkeys (Dems logo) to study JD Vance. Walz will be a complete surprise since there is no interview from him. Like Kamala. They downplayed her and didnt let her talk until the debate. No one knew what she was going to come up with."
"Doritos, doesn't need any dip because she dipped at our border, dipped out of sight"
They can't find anyone that can confirm she worked at McDonald's ?
Unless it was edited she answered that 'guilty pleasure' question very quickly.   She knows the questions.
"She sounds like a person that never reads, hence has no vocabulary. And when she learns a new word like ""significance"" or ""investment"" or ""holistic"" she overuses it even where it doesn't belong."
I am a young man. I watched this interview. This woman is nuts.
"Good afternoon, ""Giggles"" lol Trump-Vance 2024!"
I can’t afford a $6-7 bag of Doritos
Kamala from da hood!
You ever notice she has man hands?
"I wont watch cbs at all<br> I will hear who won tomorrow on ""outnumbered"""
"My god, this woman is insufferable."
She went to the clubs when she was in Kindergarten?
I'm home recovering.   I have watched CBS for the past 15 hours.  I have seen 15 Kamala Harris commercials compared to 2 Trump commercials.  Thank God for FOX news!!
"Lord , have mercy"
I like Joe Concha's expression.  It is like he is almost speechless
Why is she talking like that?
"Really, people this that should be president? 😂"
We learned you need a napkin near by when eating Doritos 😮
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
"Don't know how it's possible to give Harris ANY positive coverage, much less a majority of it. Show you how worthless the majority of news outlets are today. Just plain a waste of time to watch/listen to."
"Dems made 2 HUGE mistakes, Mummy and now Cackle on the ticket. FF this adm, we are a laughing stock. The worst mor ons!!!"
"If anyone ever asks you what the word ""condescending"" means just play this video. She might as well have asked these guys what their favorite fried chicken restaurant was. 😂"
🤢 I’d love to be middle class right now.
The Kamala Harris Amateur Hour
Young voters can’t afford Doritos because of her
"Trump haters cant even begin to say he doesnt answer questions..  It might take a little to get down to it, but she is just not even trying to answer anything!  MAGA 2024  TO BIG TO RIGGG"
This interview means absolutely nothing to helping American people. How anyone can vote for her is totally disfunctional themselves. Our country is in trouble and all she is worrying about is put out a stupid interview like this. Ladies its time to vote to help our country. Vote this disqualified woman out of the white house. Its time she goes back to California. Vote for the one that will fix their scree ups. Trump
They looked uncomfortable yes cringe
"Cheating will happen  pizza boxes on windows, broken waterpipes,flooding ,3am kamuaulka votes suddenly skyrocket as vanloads of fictitious ballots are dropped in mail by sanctuary citizens and illegal immigrants alianamericans...."
No way she can deal with other leaders. Nuts
"And her Nervous, Insecure laugh follows every stupid comment she makes.  Even those two dudes were uncomfortable."
"B S from Concha. Tell DT to refrain from the personal abuse and talk about HIS policies for once . Tell him to be a ""grown up"". for once."
Who ever votes for this person there will be a draft both men and women cause we will get involved not sure which side they will keep border open say anything to get elected we will lose everything I'm 69 seen alot of people but this is the worst
She is so fake you can tell  they are not impressed  and like please let this  interview  be over
"Wake up she is not the only one, it is a strategy used by politicians they do not answer real questions that impact the economy."
"But she can ,( giggle that helps in world affairs"
Its an insult to young men that she thinks she used to go Clubbing and loves Doritos will draw them.<br>HOW Is THAT going to reduce energy costs? Reduce Crime? Stop ILLEGAL immigration? Reduce housing costs?<br>Reduce college costs? Create Jobs?
What is the deal with that fake accent?
Fake accent word salad again 🙄
I was going to vote for Trump until I learned Harris loves Doritos.  😅
She has to be the only candidate for president that hasn't interviewed to discuss her policys
Exactly
"Now that Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris, does this signify a potential path to the first female president of the great USA? Or does she face an uphill battle against Trump?"
"Personally, I've learned a lot from Kamala...<br><br><b>Boss:</b> Do you have that project schedule completed?<br><b>Me:</b>  Look, I was raised in a middle class family....<br><br><b>Wife:</b> You didn't forget our anniversary again, did you?<br><b>Me:</b>  Look, I was raised in a middle class family...."
Just SO Cringy and Sad 🥹<br>God Help us !
"We have murderers in our country because of her. Don’t know about you, but I am having a harder time making ends meet"
"I was looking at some new polls on Real Clear Politics. At face value, they show a small Trump surge. A closer look reveals this small surge being projected by three rightwing pollsters: Trafalgar, Rasmussen, and Atlas Intel. They're so biased, they're actually more skewed than the fox news polls."
The napkin wasn't for the doritos!!!😮
Can she talk politics instead of clubbing and Doritos??
"They did not fact check trump 11 times, your a liar!"
Kamala got to win
She does not want the prices down they want to make people dependent on the Gov.
"Stacy Johnson - (facepalm) ""No! Don't tell people we're friends!"""
She won't be president. Wake up and listen to God!
"Good for you, Kakala! We can't even afford Doritos nowadays!😱"
hey talk to the Angel mom's
I can’t believe CamelToe is currently the Vice President and will possibly be the President.  This can’t be real
"That sounds like Donald Trump, I have a Concept of a plan."
What kind of questions are these? 🤪🤪
They should fact check because JD will be 💯 right and tampon Tim will be 100% wrong
"I am not a fan of Trump the man, never had any interest in him prior to his presidency. Definitely a fan of Trump the president. But boiled down to basics, I think I would enjoy a conversation with him, I don't know if we would see eye to eye on a lot of things outside of politics, but I still think it would be engaging. I think by the end of a conversation with Kamala Harris I would want to claw my eardrums out"
I wonder  what  kind  of  dressing she wants  on her  salad
"One would say, both Man are sitting but don't enjoy it, chairs to low but she is sitting in a wonderful chair,  iBoys next time speak UP for a better Chair You deserve it 🙏."
Kindergardener.never grew up
"Doritos... thinking she'll get the hispanic votes! Probably, only the Doritos owner and its employees!"
She is not conected to the alertness that some one need to answer a question. Even students have to answer the question when they are asked. Cognitive system not alert at all. Not working.
"'"" old skool original '"" .. Nacho .  wasn't original <br>Lie.!,"
It's hard to believe that a person like kamala could ever end up even being on the ticket to be commander and chief of the United States! It's mind boggling and very dangerous!! Think for yourself. How was everything when Trump was in office compared to what we have now! This great country will fall with four more years of what we have now! Vote for TRUMP IS A MUST!!!!!
"Dear friends who rely on FOX, just a friendly reminder FOX had to pay $750 MILLION for misinformation and stated under oath that<br>FOX is not a ""news"" provider, simply entertainment!"
This woman would take America to war.
"Young people know better. Remember her quoting, ""Young people are stupid."" She can't walk that back!"
Didn't know doritos paired well with vodka
Tim is scared 😅😅😂😂 having panics attacks
Harris was pretending to be Black again. Shameless Insulting Pandering.
Main stream media will swear Walz beats Vance so why bother to watch it.
President party girl.
Dog and pony show
My old boots make more sense 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"At this point I lose just as much respect for the people interviewing Harris trying to help her win the seat, they have to know Harris doesn't  have any capability of running a country.."
GO VANCE !!!❤❤❤
Minnesota thinks THEY were robbed.  Ahahahahaha.
"Sorry, I was just sick in my mouth..."
Bok bok bok bok. Looks like Joe is auditioning for a position in the Trump Swamp. Doing a good job as bootlicker clearly not talking about Trump at all. Does he know that the more people know about Kamala she is closing the gap on economy and immigration. Kamala/Walz 2024 2028.
This gave two dudes visiting a crazy aunt at the halfway house vibe. They didn't appear engaged but did appear bored and discouraged.
she seems foreign......
"I’m 23 years old and I’m voting for Trump. <br><br>Keep in mind, Harris called 18 - 29 year olds stupid. Now she’s crying for our vote."
Them two guys couldn't even look at her straight in the eyes. I mean its just a simple coversation and they still can't stand her.
Kamala was taught to keep a napkin Handy by Old Willie
That is not cringe. It is very relatable.
Now joe will resign because of war and she will be the democrats appointed president
Fake whatever she is trying to sound hip
"What does friends, clubbing and her favorite chip snacks have to do with leading the World?  Obviously she is desperately trying to make friends but last time I looked that's not necessarily a qualification to lead the US let alone the World but then she can always default to her Pronouns which will leave our Enemies shaking in their shoes."
This is a crap conversation. I’m not interested with her doritos. There are more important and urgent things to talk about
Disgusting ! I CRINGED ! Doritos pissed me off !
She's not eating no Doritos!! She needs to stop lying!!! Everybody doesn't eat Doritos or smoke Marijuana!!
She needs to go back to San Francisco or French Canada
"If Kamala Harris told the truth about who she is, and what her agenda is, her  candidacy would be over..  That is why she never answers directly.  Donald Harris, her father, is a Marxist professor in economics."
You can tell the guys can sense Kamala’s fakeness. They can hardly make eye contact. Cringe level 1000.
Nah. She’s not like US. 👎🏾
Kamala Harris ended her career when Biden told to go to protect the border and she said no and went home instead.
I'm not voting for ANYONE who won't take questions LIVE from on fox news. If she can't handle fox news she can't handle Putin!
And she wants to be the President? Are you kidding me? 🤬 the people are devastated by the effects of this hurricane and soon we will be affected by the port strike and she is just talking nonsense!! 🤮🤮🤮🙄🙄🙄🙄
Talking about Doritos with war in the Middle East and people in a national emergency in North Carolina Florida etc
What a disgrace and waste of perfectly good air. Blah blah blah.. only 4 weeks to go! TRUMP/VANCE 2024❤❤
She’s is the biggest joke!
"Tell it like it is! Who put people in cages and separated families when president, wants a mass deportation if elected, & stacked the courts to take away all our rights?! Not Kamala!"
Anyone fact checking klacky??
She makes me uncomfortable
What has Rump said about making ends meet? Oh yeah Drill baby Drill. Which is a term from the only Black Republican that tried to steer the party in a direction that tossed him out because of the color of his skin not the content of his character. This phrase will come up again during the election and not one of the people who say this has the actual album of the March on Washington
"She has No concept, No ideas,  No policy's,  No answers..... Just rehearsed words/ word salads and stealing other people's ideas.  And now,  we have attacks going on in the middle east less that 24 hours after biden said there needs to be a cease fire immediately."
And Trump wasn’t Presidential 😂😂😂😂
Touchette
"Kamala’s the bad vice president in history. She doesn’t have any talent , she only knows copying from others. She should be shameful herself in front of the American people. We vote for Trump- Vance"
What Indian food isn't her favorite?
Not doing fact check it's a mistake. JD Vance is a bloody liar
"She probably would tell you she started eating Doritos while she was working at McDonalds. Oh wait, McDonalds doesn't sell Doritos!"
Liar!
"Wow,who would want her to be the commander of the strongest country in the world"
Majority of comments didn't go in her favor.
She says the same thing over and over repeat yourself
Omg that suit. BwaAaaaaaaa
Cringe
The alternative is a78 year old bitter angry serial criminal.
She supports marxism…not good for the country and the Americans and the whole world!
The two interviewers are playing to her. No tuff questions
"I want to see someone toss these T-ball questions at Donald Trump. Because he is an adult who has held serious jobs and has been a true leader, I don't think he would dignify them with lengthy answers."
"Yesterday Kellyanne Conway said on FOX that she believes Trump will debate Kamala one more time after he watches tonight's VP debate.    I really hope Kellyanne is right about that, but personally I doubt the coward will do it.   It actually would be a disaster for him to do, and surprising that Kellyanne seems to want him to.   LOL LOL LOL     Obviously Trump would have debated Biden seven days a week right up to election day if he could, but for good reason Trump is terrified of facing Kamala again, as he should be!   LOL LOL    I love the world laughing at the coward!       GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!"
"The world is going up in flames and they're asking questions about Doritos???? As Kamala says ""Walz don't work"". Trump/Vance 2024"
Common sense people vote Trump
For is for fairies
"She has no substance, even her laugh is not real"
Two colwns
She is very getto
"Kam-Mullah ,YOUR FIRED!"
She is not real
"Doritos? Has the VP of the USA nothing important to say, ever?"
She is nit real
She is a joke
She is a joke
"I honestly dont understand how anybody is supporting Kamala. She has ruined Amrica and has made it completely DANGEROUS!! I dont always like how up front President Trump is, but he is willing to risk his life to save this country... That's what we need!!"
She laughs all day she’s definitely doped up on somethin
"I don’t get it… Why would Jesus protect a rapist? A thief? A liar? A con man? A rich person hoodwinking poor people to send him their hard-earned money, to buy Bibles he has signed?"
"Hard hitting interview! Also, she’s wearing a $60k Tiffany necklace - how’s that for a middle class girl?"
That whole interview was so awkward/cringe 😖😖😖😣
"Harris praises Doritos, while Kennedy, working with the Trump campaign, is talking about the dangerous ingredients in processed foods. But Harris is the more serious candidate."
She is so hars to look at and listen too
"If JD Vance doesn't win this debate against Tim Walz, then Trump might  need to accept Kamala Harris's second debate challenge."
Trump says Kemp can’t reach Biden for help. And then we see footage where Kemp says he has all the helps he needs from the feds. Trump is pure lies.
Young real men will just find her annoying
I move for a vote of no confidence
"Rudy Giuliani's Daughter Implores Voters To Dump Trump In Poignant Essay About Her Dad
<br>“Take it from me, Trump destroys everything he touches,"" wrote Caroline Rose Giuliani."
God I can't stand her
I wish I could still afford Doritos.
Yikes. A North America led by Trudeau and Harris?
Whats your favorite jelly donut😂
"Come On, Man"
Sad part the bag of Doritos would be a better independent option than Kamala 😬😬😬😬😬🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😎👍👍
If Walz borrows Kamala’s pearl earrings he might have a snowball’s chance in hell😂
I own socks that are smarter than Harris.
Well the fake accent is back I hear 🤦‍♀️🤪
Vote for Trump Vance 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 2024
A napkin for Doritos 😂
"Yes indeed they sent someone to my house to target my 20 years old to vote for Kamala, like Kamala stated young people are stupid,my son is not stupid, he graduate high school at 17 years old with his associate in art degree from College. My son is smart enough, he took math in college so my son understand economy well"
May God help us and remove her. She’s dangerous for sure.😡
"I was pleasantly surprised that FOX news called out Trump for his blatant lying about the Biden administration's response to the hurricane disaster.    As usual Trump spewed total lies and I guess FOX is tired of getting sued for supporting Trump's lies so felt compelled to call him out!     We definitely need more of that.   Trump can and does lie to his cult dozens of times every day, but the sane people deserve better, and I am proud of FOX for calling him out for these lies!       GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!"
She thinks all young men are now eating massive amounts of TOFU! 😂🤣😂
Hats off to this guy for watching the whole interview. I can not listen to this woman anymore.
Plain Doritios (which they do not make anymore best I can tell) were the original.  Not Nacho flavor.<br><br>Harris is old enough to know that.
"HOW IS THIS PRESIDENTIAL RACE SO CLOSE!?!? I don't get it, at all! She... Is... A... Horrible person"
A country needs a leader not a jester
If young men ever want to own a home they would never consider voting for her socialist policies that she won’t even share with the public because the policies are so scary
She's still cackling
She makes baby huey look like Albert Einstein. Im with Trump 100%
She's  great.  Thank God there's  a grown up running
She’ll win because they’ll cheat again with the ballet drops at 2-3 am
"How about condoms, tattoos, pot, body piercing"
Not an interview-cringe!! She lied about middle class again!!! Came from a privileged family in Canada-her neighbor showed the house she lived in-not middle-class . Her Mother was a Scientist!!! Father professor!
"Who is this old lady 😢 she's not in her right mind, Poison Ivy Harris Absolutely Nothing Done"
"Kamala is ""shredded"" but DonOLD gives us ""they're eating the dogs and cats,"" give the cops one ""very violent hour"" with shoplifters, the ""world is ending if I don't get elected,"" and that's completely normal."
I'm a democrat in the she's not presidential material. On knowledgeable have another brand where to buy a pass for you that's what I thought time to give the country a break American desserts the best don't let them use that abortion they don't care about you an abortion do not illegal what's up to every individual state what's the percentage of that don't make that your it's each state individual and it will never band thumbs down to your governor
"🎶five foot two, eyes of blue, but oh what these feet could do….. has anybody been my gal?             Turned up nose and turned down hose, never had another beau, has anybody seen my gal? 🎶.  Almost prophetic… lol"
She is delusional
Where’s “Corn Pop” when you need him? 😂
Just watching her hand movement shows many hours of rehearsals. To me this is new. She never really did that before she was placed as the nominee.<br>She has no plan.<br>She's nothing but a puppet.
CHRISTIANS FOR KAMALA 🙏🏼🙏🏼
The stench of impending doom is rife in these comments.
Dang I’m so sick of that laugh
I can’t stand her !
Embarrassing
THE JOKER 🃏 LAUGHING QUEEN!!!!🤡
Kamala and the democrats are doing all the heavy lifting while republicans are holding meaningless hearings in the House.
Tim looks like a goof next to JD 😅 lol im sorry but JD can really get cookin!!!
"Well, the ice cream questions worked for Biden so they figure doritoes will work for Harris. These people don't even eat right. We need a healthy America (RFK Jr.)<br>Vote TRUMP and his dream team 🇺🇸."
“18-24 year olds are stupid” 😂😅 Pro War 0 votes Kamala Harris said that!
Oh please... What the heck am I seeing... Ven diagrams?<br><br>As for the VP debate... Wonder of we going to see another 'that's my dad...' moment 😂
Biden and Ice cream is to Kamala and Doritos
I want to know about the McDonald's lie. It's a huge red flag.
For all of you young men out there beware!!!
Harris lied 23 times in the debate don't ask what lies you know them......ok lefties now you can resort to name calling with no substance
"All JD has to do is answer the questions clearly, like he has been doing with these questions he has taken from CNN & other liberal media."
"Oh, Dear God.😮"
Cackling repeats redundantly as usual !!🤔
"Why won't one single person ask her about the Mark lie. Date , year , location , and a simple social security work statement history?"
I will never eat Doritos again
If DJT tries to interfere with our nation and attempt to subvert an election and cause a riot. I say arrest him on the spot. Be ready for this sick fake con man.
the kackler strikes again.
“I be up in dat nacho I do declare!” - Camela Hurrus
Where are her critical thinking skills?
She has forgotten most of those club kids can’t even afford to get into the clubs or even the bag of Dorito right now
This is the best Obama can come up with?
Our American Black community men control the outcome of Georgia and possibly the destiny of our country.🙏🏼🇱🇷
Kamala Harris 47th 💙 🇺🇸
Lady please 👋👋👋
Vote for Trump if you want to end overtime pay!
The bot harris supporters are out I see
"Lmao, Joe Concha did not look amused by her.    More like sickened!"
If Harris wins it means that we've surrendered our country without a fight.
President and vice do nothing...   Impeach Biden and Harris
"Those two guys are wishing they were somewhere , anywhere else  besides sitting in on the Kami show !!! You can see it in there faces !!! A never again moment for them I'm sure !!!  Just an observation"
"It's like she spoke ""Christmas""!  How dare she speak ""Doritos"" in an ongoing disaster rescue effort?!"
So she can answer a question! She likes Nacho flavored Doritos.
“Right”?
"If you only want women to make decisions about their own bodies, let men decide who they want to vote for. You can still vote for Harris, but you can’t force a trump supporter to vote Harris."
I think a lot of democrats won't tell you they're voting Trump.
That nauseous laughing hurts the ears.
This interview is yet another campaign ad for Trump!
"What a stupid interview, meanwhile trump talks to Dave Ramsey about ideas while she hides away."
She is unfit as VP and she cannot become President.   TRUMP 2024
I prefer the kentucky tennessee southern accent than your horrible new York accents
How fake she is
"Hmmm, those NBA relics talking to Harris are part of the 1%. Harris is deservedly her own worst enemy.  Let her keep talking. 😂😂😂😂😂😂 SAVE AMERICA 🇺🇸"
Who tf eats Doritos with a napkin ?😂 she is so weird
Doritos are poison..so is she
Don't forget the hot sauce for those Doritos.
"First thing they will do IS Fact check in a round about way , trust me they can't help themselves"
"Those guy’s faces said everything, GO VOTE TRUMP/VANCE❤️🇺🇸"
Doh-Reee-Toes
One Groovy Gal ! ?
No young male is going to vote for anyone who’s going to draft them to fight the Democrats war!
"Democrats don't care! They think she and the administration will just figure it out after she's elected. However, I don't expect a good choice and action by her or the democrats if she's elected. ."
Grabbing a bag of nasty Nacho Doritos always solves my middle class family problems.  lol!
I have fond memories of doritos too! Yall remember the good old days when they weren't $7 a bag!!!!!
"Shameful, fakes, lies. Young man, stoned, scary lady"
Foxnews ku klux klan news network
🥴...<br><br><br>Take a moment and let that sink in❗<br><br>NUFF SAID
She is sooo fake
Cringe lol that’s being polite.
She is hollistically clear !!!
All hands on deck for this vote people vote of a lifetime. If this crazy left women gets in this country as we know it is toast. NC women here for TRUMP along with all my friends and family. VOTE VOTE VOTE our lives depend on it!!!
"Come on everybody, thisssss can't be president. Wake up everybody. Really!!!!"
She went to clubs with Montel Williams
"Pancakes, bacon, collards in the bathtub and doritos! It the ECONOMY STUPID!"
I like Doritos also.But i still dont like Kamala's policies.🤣😂👎
I’m sure she can win over young man if she pulls a WillyBrown maybe Homeland security needs to look on those tapes from P. Diddy’s parties. Obama I heard was on there possibly Kamala too
DORITOS are fully baked KAMALA is not even half baked. 😂🙃🤪
Watching Kakola is starting to make me physically ill.
"She's simply not good in front of a camera or a mic, enough said."
Doritos must pair well with boxed white zinfandel. Classy 😂
FOX is pathetic.
"GA, FL, SC, NC, apply for FEMA assistance.  Ignore fox and Doni lies, governors say they are being provided everything they request."
"Most of the youth she is trying to reach are college students/educated,  they need answers."
"If she keeps shakin’her money maker, she just might get their vote."
Why can’t Trump give any specifics about his plans?
I knew the first time she opened her mouth that she was not qualified! What are people/voters waiting for her to say??! She is NOT qualified. Period.<br>TRUMP Vance 🇺🇸 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
"Who else would still want to be her friend anyway, the nanny?"
Who thinks Harris is 1000X worse than Biden)??
I cannot listen and watch her!
I’m so impressed with her scripted answers 😂
"Black, millennial, married man. My wife and I are both 28. We were both loyal Democrats, voting for Hillary in 2016. I voted for Trump in 2020 and my wife Biden. Now, in 2024, we are both voting Trump in a swing state. The major reason I stopped supporting the Democratic party is due to their embrace of transgender ideology, supporting men in women's bathrooms and sports and Democrats, such as in my former home state of California, diluting parents rights. Becoming a father changed everything for me in how I look at the world and my role in shaping my children's upbringing. I have two toddler sons and another on the way. I don't want them growing up in a world where half the country cannot tell us what a woman or man is."
Remember Harris said 18–24-year-olds are stupid. Don't prove her right. Vote Trump 2024!
👹She didn't say anything anything about Willie Brown I guess she's keeping him a secret 👺
She knows nothing about Doritos (or anything else) because the original flavor was Toasted Corn followed by Taco.
How can anybody vote for her?
Is it possible for her to have a conversation without cackling constantly? Is it?!!
I think her staff probably does give her stuff to look at and she doesn’t look at it. She’s lazy and they’re probably scared of her. We’ve heard from staff that she’s a soul crushing bully.
Asking the 60 year old hair die champion for his opinion on whether it’s resonating with young men 😂😂😂 Go Fox go!! 😅
So what you like Doritos 😄...and
<b>REPUBLICANS FOR KAMALA</b>
The world is on fire and her and Joe have zero accomplishments... There's nobody in the White House.
Kamal evil who cares about your fake stories. All lies 😂
🇺🇲 Donald Trump 🇺🇲<br>He's got my vote and support  !!!!<br>A real American president that's supports the people of the united states not a lying politician like Harris
Lol<br>My kids want nothing to do with her
Ah….Fox News with the negative spin.
"That's OK. She's still going to win. You know it, as much as you might deny it outwardly."
And how can maga's vote for someone who lied about working at McDonald's! Right fox? 😂😅
She betta thank a basketball playa!
this is so cringeworthy - these ball players aren't buying her at all- the one player didn't even look at her...
The only thing sillier than Harris are those supporting her.
FOX News is getting desperate to make their uneducated audience think Harris is not running away with this election.
"Just asked Alexa to translate her responses,  still waiting..."
Harris / Walz 2024! 💙 Trump Prison 2024! He's almost 100 years old - and appealing to young male voters?
"Liar, you buried your cackle for a while. Put it away again!"
She believes that rigging the machines again sets her on the throne but not this time.
A big day November 5th  Patriots vs Steelers
"KAMALA HARRIS , HELL NO !!<br>United States will be in trouble if she's president !!!!!!!"
Love JD Vance!👍
When will Kamala grow up and talk about the country????
"What the world thinks - Pew
<br>Biden 75% 2022
<br>Kamala 55%  2022
<br>Trump 17%  2020"
Her career as a politician is over… 😂😂😂
"Any US felon can enter the United Kingdom if their conviction is considered spent. Spent refers to those that happened over 10 years ago.
<br>WAHEY!!!! No more Donnie!"
Young voters are rfegistering in droves - and they tend not to be brain dead.
🗨 Harris 🗨<br>Daw hum  see you in tea. 👍
"Young male voters, especially the no college type, are set in their ways like their parents. And if their parents are Republican, there's nothing Harris can say that will change their minds."
"The ""OG"" is Taco flavored Doritos...nacho did not exist"
"Tim Walz, just like Kamala Harris, and Joe Bud absolutely horrifying the disgusting"
I'm going with vomit🤮
They were baiting her for that accent lol
Trump lied about Project 2025. He really would use it as a guideline for his administration.
Happy 💯 birthday to Jimmy Carter!<br><br>I hope he gets his wish to congratulate Madame President in 35 days.
"Erdogan:UN must stop Israel,even byforce"
God forbid they should ask her a political question!!
Tough question.
"How are you going to lower costs? ""Free doritos for all."" 🤪"
"Young male voters, if they are smart enough, don't vote for a lying HATE show that Trump puts on every day of his life.  Integrity always matters, and it should matter to men of all backgrounds, races, ethnicities, orientations, etc.  Democrats have done better economically, care about the cost of college loans, and both parties are pushing for more funding for vocational training."
Trump2024 all the way
She called 18-26 year olds stupid. Ought to learn not to vote for her
This woman is DANGEROUS for our country!!!!!!
Trump 2024🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉FKH
"When are the main stream media news outlets going to be held to telling the FULL  story? Not just the Democratic point of view! Net Flix just got their biggest subscription cancelation ever!  ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, hopefully will fall as well, for airing only Democratic coverage, and NOT Republican coverage! They NEED  to start covering BOTH <br>Democrats and Republicans! They should worry, come Nov. 6th of their future in staying in business! Tell the FULL story or fade away!"
She said she is blessed. LOL. What a joke . I don't believe that evil is blessed.
"What is up with these ""interviews"" with absolutely ZERO substance!?! Who cares about her favorite chips, or night clubs! How is she going to fix what SHE and Grandpa Joe Broke!?! You know who cares about her favorite chip? People who don't vote! 12 year olds, and 35 year olds living in mommy's basement."
Texas going Blue 💙💙💙
"If you don't have cable or internet..the news you hear is fake news but you don't no it, I was guilty of no time. Now retired I  have time & internet  I see all the BS.I can many  many more  still  only hear fake news  and believe it!Why else listen to Harris?INTERNET should  be free!"
Whats amazing is she can afford doritos while all of the rest of us have to cut chips out of our grocery list because we cant afford them. thanks a lot Biden/Harris
Wow ! she eats Doritos just like me ? If I find out she also likes pizza I’m Forgetting everything else and voting for her

Fact Checking should only be done by the ones running for office and the mod squads
Doritos? Really? The world is burning for heaven's sake!!!
The house is shredding everything it can to make America worst again.
So Iran hasn't been able to land a single missile in any populated area in Israel? Doesn't sound like they're much of a threat. No need for any overblown reaction. Get smart.
Is it too much to ask Donald Trump to STOP LYING ?
💙💙💙 TRUMP 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Trump now more than ever!!
"Cringe, In a recent speech Trump claimed he has a better beach body than Joe Biden - Trump is nuts and tacky, and so unpresidential!"
She's clueless  I'm literally so scared if she wins
VANCE VANCE VANCE 2024 VP 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸❤️❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸

"I wonder how long it's gonna be before Kamala starts saying, ya nah what sayin."
Those men DEBASED themselves!!! What cringe 🤮
I don't care call Kamala Harris grew up in the middle age household I don't care
"It's odd, VP Harris reminds me of that Seinfeld episode 2 face, away from light pretty, in direct light OMG augh!"
Good old giggles
Kamala doesn't even make it up halfway on the 'Peter Principle' competency scale.
make america straight again
She just sounds like someone's boozy aunt... all the time.
JD Vance is smart 👌
Go Vance!!!!!
she just is a power grabber
She is constantly laughing. Never stops smiling then laughing again. She is bizarre.
"!!I recently sold some of my long-term position and currently sitting on about 250k, do you think Nvidia is a good buy right now or I have I missed out on a crucial buy period, any good stock recommendation on great performing stocks or Crypto will be appreciated."
She should run for Dorito queen
"How many times did she say, “Ya know”?????"
"Actually, Taco flavor Doritos were the first flavor. Nacho came later. J.S."
SHE MAKES GOOFY LOOK SMART.
Kamala confused Doritos with crack.
Hilary’s puppet Kamala cannot speak about what she does not know!  It’s time to step up and grab the reins because this is a run away government heading over a cliff!
"I am young male , I will NEVER vote for Harris !!!!"
"Hillary Clinton said some ""very bad news about Kamala"" will come out this month. She called it the ""October surprise""."
"They needed more time to train Kamala, this is a rock and this is a stick LOL"
The new silent majority will be former Trump supporting women who have soured on Trump and will secretly vote for Harris at the ballot box.  “Yeah honey I voted for Trump. -wink-“  all these MAGA dudes about to be sold out by their own spouses.
That HORRID laugh. 😖
"Inflation, inflation, inflation and she helped create it and Kamala would rather ignore it."
We can’t have her in Office 👎 keep politics away from SPORTS.  In the name of JESUS CHRIST please do not allow her as PRESIDENT. I WILL STAND BY JESUS 🙏
She’s not a smart person.
"Harris/Walz will increase the burden on the American working class tax payers by 5 Trillion dollars from ""Day One"""

Kamala  = Communism
Vote to big to rig

Again... Out of all the important and meaningful questions that could be asked... And she's having a conversation about tortilla chips... Lord help us. Trump 2024
I'm white and can talk more black than she can I grew up on the south side
She definitely does not deserve the presidency… she is woke!!😂
Why does she have to laugh about everything?  While people are dying here and in other countries. . . disgusting!
My guilty pleasure is sour diesel.
"I don’t even believe she “grew up in a middle class family”.  She even lies about this.  Can’t trust her about anything, except maybe her food likes."
"Trump says talyor swift is voting for him, how could he possibly lose,"
My 20 yr old son can’t stand her and he is hyped up to vote for Trump as his first time voting ever! Economy and secure border are his top concerns and he has actually done his homework. Trump 2024!!!
Trump 2024

Whats bothersome is her confidence- is this a plan to steal ?

Cringe
Dont trust  her vote for  mr. Trump ❤
What  is  that crazy  woman  on Trump  2o24
Those guys look like they wanna walk outa there.
She can issue some hyena crypto tokens
Fox is pretty desperate right now. <br>😂😂😂
Trump has nothing to offer to Americans.
She in way over her head
"Harris/Walz will increase the burden on the American working class tax payers by 5 Trillion dollars from ""Day One"""
So dumb
Accent check!...
Bet there were footprints on the headliner of that Seville
Those comments were hilarious 😂
She is everything to everyone. She thinks we’re stupid. We don’t like people bc they pretend to like everything we do. What is this middle school?
"One word, sick. This is as good as it gets."
I LIKE DORITOS TOO ....THATS IT....I AM VOTING FOR HER BECAUSE SHE EATS THE SAME SNACK CHIPS AS ME!!!!😢😢😢😢
My good god ....
Just watch the peoples faces who interviews her… you can see it all over their faces that she is not it
"For World Peace, American Success, Personal Wealth and a Healthy Economy I will vote President Trump and a straight Republican ticket"
Fox News is totally lost unless they are talking about butt chugging Bud Light.
Trump 2024
"They, those two man, where so uncomfortable with her not answer the questions, they laughed not naturally 😅"
"Didn't think she was that crazy, but ......"

Yuck!! 🤢 I’m sorry
Trump 2024 🇺🇲
Trump was asked how he’d make childcare more affordable and his response was tariffs. 🤦‍♂️
"She don't eat no doritoes, everyone knows you lick the powder off your fingers lmao"
What a tough interview; Trump goes on interviews where the people interviewing him hates his guts.
"With world events linning up and happening presently, young males don't feel safe of her leadership because they are the ones that will be DRAFTED"
"it does not matter what she does or says, Not a single American will vote for Kamala, they will all vote for or against Trump.."
Stacey Johnson...goofy as can be
Cringe was Trump on Aidin Ross’s weird podcast show. That was the cringe appeal to young voters lol.

"In my opinion it’s very clear to me that because she’s a celeb (and all celebs are used to push agendaz on mainstream) they got her hitched in a fake relationship (as most celebz) have to a man who will silenceHer. I think she must have really low self esteem to be with a man who’s shown signz of being controlling. I feel bad for her and anyone with that much weight because often it’s depression. MaIezlike this would be better unaIiv, it would be better for the planet and the children if they were nothere. Glad she got out ! This is not uncommon, most women deal with this sh on a daily basis that’s why we no longer talk to em on the internet and especially don’t do dating apps."

"Hey layze, I just wanted to tell you why they got married so fast, but before that the guy in the video is doing sins and it is prohibited in Islam to do such things. But the reason why Muslims get married so fast is, because in Islam  Muslims are prohibited from dating and touching the other gender (as in shaking hands and etc). So instead the guy meets the girls family and asks for her hand and they get to know each other, and after around 2-6 months or so they end up doing Nikkah (religious marriage) so that they can be married through religion and now can finally hold hands and stuff, and then 1 month to 1-2 weeks later we usually have weddings."

"I’m a dessert kind of girl too (in regards to unhealthy vices) vs salty stuff…. though if it comes to shrimp or lobster or Alaskan king crab… That is probably on my top-tier list of foods to eat besides sweets. Followed by some snickerdoodle or chocolate chip cookies, or some sour gummy candy and then a nice big bowl of berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries). Definitely not healthy stuff besides the berries and shrimp/lobster/king crab (though I love dipping those seafood dishes in butter so that’s probably not the healthiest either). Garlic butter shrimp/lobster. Nom nom!!!Anyway…"

Man this brings back horrible memories of a past relationship I was in where this man convinced me I needed to serve him as if he was God. Degraded me and I was dumb and ate that crap up. I’m sickened when I look back on it. I refuse to ever let myself into that toxicity again.

"Layze posted on my birthday, truly the ultimate gift!!"
Layne please be aware she’s an animal abuser.  She knowingly let her elderly cats claws grow into her pads.  She withheld food from the cat so the vet would be more likely to euthanize her.  She’s  pumping her current cat full of drugs so she won’t go into heat instead of getting her spayed.
"Anyone in the comments saying they feel bad for Foodie clearly doesn't know anything about her. If you did, you wouldn't feel even a shred of sympathy for her. She is quite possibly one of the most evil, psychotic, unhygienic, and abusive people on the planet. Youtube won't allow me to say what she's done to animals. Let's just say she thinks it's hilarious to play ""real life frogger"" with her car and assorted species of wildlife. And that's not even mentioning what she's done to her pets."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyJkPvzjVH8&t=64"">1:04</a> YASSSSSSSSSS SLAYYYYYYYYY"
I go to Wendy’s for their salads they are so good
"She would be funny to watch, too bad she is an animal abuser that left her senior cat to suffer all kinds of treatable sicknesses and let her claws get so long, they curled up under in her paw pads. 😔"

Why did he take video of him texting??  I dont understand
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyJkPvzjVH8&t=103"">1:43</a> idk why but i just decided to calculate how much that would be each minute<br><br>$500 for 4 hours, means that you divide 500 ÷ 4 which equals to $125. that is how much you have to pay for each hour of the flight. now take 125 and divide it by 60, which is how many minutes are in an hour. the results is a coma and a lot of numbers behind it, so how much you would need to pay is <b><i>2 dollars and a few cents</i></b> for every minute (i don't live in America so i don't really know how the currency is there). and uhh, since they've been breathing for 5 minutes, that's approximately $10"
"I eat breakfast everyday on 7am maximum, wdym 😂 I live faraway from school so I have to stomach food as early as possible (I don't skip breakfast). But well... I guess I won't eat THAT much all the time. But it's not out of the menu to have a plate of spaghetti once in while for breakfast 😋"

"'I dont know him'<br><br>Girl, you married him after a month."
all i can say is damn
Sky News needs to mind their own business instead of spreading lies. Talk about bias!
Lohistic
"Kamala is like a child, practising  the use of a new addition to her infant level vocabulary! 😅"
If she wins that will be fine end of the country
Shes lying
Oh Boy...
You can tell when kamala lies everytime she opens her mouth
I love you Sky News!!  So truthful!!
"Kamala never seems to come up with any FACTS, FIGURES, STRATEGIES and PLANS! Moreover,  WHAT  has she actually DONE  or ACHIEVED in the past 4 years? 😮"
"I have to ask and wonder, what, if anything, is going on in the space between this woman's ear? If one gave this sort of vacuous answer or reply in any interview for a job of substance, they would politely shake your hand and never contact you again. Considering she is contesting for the top job in Western democracy is beyond belief that these interviewers give her such an easy ride, and, moreover, she thinks she is capable and eligible to stand for the presidency."
"HOLISTICLY speaking , wheh 10% when BINEN WAS COHERENT was better then wordsalad ( but mind salad ) of harris .  FROM INSIDE SOURCES , DEMON RATS think TO BRING BACK BIDEN FOR MORE CHANCES"
Where did she buy her degree
"Im a democrat and I dont like this woman. She should not even be the nominee, she wasnt voted in. I thought this was a democracy."
"We have always been hard working people and now we're Seniors.   We've worked hard for our America and now She's so deep in debt that it's becoming a nightmare!   In God I trust and our America needs Trump and Vance help to save our country and lead Her back to prosperity for ""WE THE PEOPLE"" 2024! 🇺🇲❤️🙏❤️🇺🇲"
"If American people choose her to lead their country,  God bless America !"
She is only a pawn. She has to do as the elites say. Our nation is stumbling downwards. We need a leader that listens to and does as We The People need. Not what other leaders or billionaires want.
"kamalala literally slept her way to the top, she didn't need any other competence or 'policies'."
"when you go woke, the nation goes broke"
"She's hasn't raped, tried to over throw gov. Stole millions of dollars,or doesn't have  34 felons🔵🔵🔵🔵💙💙"
🤮 Kamala 😂
All lies
"Those earnings are Bluetooth,  who is she talking too"
"This is no laughing matter. <br><br>Media should be asking how on earth can a puppet like this make it this far and more importantly who is actually running things.<br><br>I get the feeling that all mainstream media is now ""in on this theatre""."
Sky news you're maga ( moroons against great America)💙💙💙🔵
Trump 2024 ❤
We never see anything but scripted or pre planned questions in debates! She is a JOKE!!
"Reno, the Marxist Dems know that voting for Kamala is a vote for Obama. He’s the one running for prez"
Embarrassing clown 🤡 Kamala 😂
The question is how long have you been using AI….
As a Brit this is kind of absolutely none of my business- I love trump his ethos and America first - this is what evry nation should be doing staying out of eachorher business - but Harris is clearly a moron and a puppet your going from one delude idealist that lives in dreamland to another
Trump 2024
Trump 2024
Kamala is a clown 🤡 <br>Bla Bla. Bla …….. Holistically 😂 Holistically 😂<br>Holistically 😢<br>Holistically 😮
No words
Lies 😢
Don't the Taxpayers  pay enough Trump all the way
"Will this election please get over with? I don't think I can stand to look at this false face another minute. Moreover, this relentless and fake news coverage that shows that she's ahead is a national disgrace. She's a liar and a fake. He sister said that ""she'll say and do anything to get her way"". I hope FOX and SKY will find that tape and release it for all to see."
""" Lets put her in this next term"". She will create a bigger media buzz than Joe ever did! That will keep the citizens entertained while we can continue to reach or objectives to ultimately have complete control. ""All swampers in favor say aye"""
She embarrassed what the Biden crime family left as a country. How much money was she paid to let the Chinese spy balloons fly over our country? She is a drunk and a lazy idiot.
"This is sad. At this point we need Trump simply to feel safe. This dumb lady drunk on power will treat the oval office like the main set of a reality tv show, spitting nonsensical philosophy like your drunk uncle."
Liberal women are the reason our founding fathers did not give women the right to vote.
What is Sky News???  These people are not reasonable!  So sad. Wow!!
So full of it..   liair Harris
"😂😂😂 this election is simple, she is awful as a vice president and has had time to start working on things and she has done nothing so why in the hell would you want her as a president lol! She is a complete fool"
Heels up Harris
Gov. is not helping storm victims!!!! Yhats your job Mr. President. You gave FEMA S MONEY TO ILLEGALS! TRUMP IS IN!!!!!
Two things ive noticed in my 63 years. One is that the government will create a huge problem . Then they will have the sollution and solve that oroblem. Which comes with orders to follow for your own saftey. <br>The second one is to announce or create a huge dilemma that everyone focuses on while the dirty deeds are happening behind the scenes to pass a law ir enforce more regulations. Only after the supposed dilemma goes away that the dirty deeds have been done are then discovered and uts too late to do anything about it.
What a liar (the CNN anchor women)
"We need to stop calling them terrorists, it confuses the smooth brains. Call them what they are, Muslim religious fanatics. To be even more specific, Shia, Muslim fanatics. This deserves distinction because the Sunni States have been behaving this time around."
Our dreams and ambitions and aspirations are all about holistic inspirations
"All Americans need food and jobs and the people of the hurricane areas need help and to let citizens in to be able to deliver items that are needed, they don’t need government standing there saying people can’t go in to help when there’s nobody from the government is helping"
To even consider her as a candidate totally blows my mind! It trully makes me question my trust in the Government. It makes me wonder if ever the tables will turn back where the people have the piwer and absolutely the government does not. That is the constitution. The constitution clearly states any goverment acting in a tyrannical order must be removed by the citizens by whatever means possible.
When she talks about her policies she shakes her head side to side shes is telling us without telling us she is a fucking bag of shit liar.
Dont care for her
Her body language gives away when she is getting ready to answer with a lie
"sick of hearing ""dreams and aspirations"" and now ""holistic"" she is stuck in a loop....she has become a robot"
"After 4 years of Joke Biden, people should be eager to vote for change."
"In the area of body language there are certain behavior patterns that indicate wether the individual is being truthful or lying. While she is speaking her head is going from side to side saying no, no no."
"She did a terrible job the last four years. Why would she do ay better the next four years? Her and Biden were a, ""perfect,"" match.  She has early onset Alzheimer syndrome."
Notice how she speaks resembles someone? The body language... I wonder if that ear piece she always wears has Obama puppeteer on the other end...
Kamala is a very scary person. Pure evil & another WEF puppet .
She’s so hard to watch
She uses the word holistically when she hates & don't worship GOD. SHE is for satan...
"BS, nothing but BS, and lies upon lies. Nothing but holistic BS."
What a dullard.
"A monster, look at what see did the last years as vice president."
A stupid Kamaleon on the loose!
Why do I have a feeling Kamala was a regular guest at them Diddy parties
waving hands like witches wands
"wht's the message behind her ""man suits"" she wears in same exact masculine style but in different color pallet. Dictatorship subliminal, but obvious to the intelligent. Trump JD Vance only, for the sake of our lives and coutry"
"Kamala may not be smart judging her very limited vocabulary. Still she has more than 12 million illegals. So, she'll win!<br>The GOP is aslept!"
"She's too dumb to even know what ""holistically"" means. Habitual liar, as well."
She just has to be 'nice' the people like her. Sheep
I'm inspired  to tell  you  to shut the hell up Kamela.
You. Need. Resign. Kamala. You. Are. Lieing. Bitch. What. You. Did. At. Border. You. Should. Be. Jail. Life. An. No. Pension. You. Look. Good. Federal. Prison. She. Às. Smart. First. Grader
Dreams ambitions and aspirations. Non stop repeat
Exactly what policies has Kamala Harris created?? The only policy Kamala Harris announced was the one she literally stole from Trump.. What a pathetic embarrassment..
Dreams - Ambitions - ????
What Plan.’ Lying again Kamala.
Weird and stupid.  She doesn’t have black grandparents - her family in Jamaica had plantations and slaves.  FACT CHECK ME.
How anybody could vote for this woman for anything is unbelievable. I wouldn’t vote for her for dogcatcher.
"You grew up in Canada,  what do you know about american dreams"
"How the hell was she ever a prosecutor ?   Who did she prosecute, Bozo???"

She should revert to old tactics and lay on her back with legs in the air and hope for the best!
I think this shows very clear neither her or Biden are the ones who have been running the country.
I hate this cgannel
"Please check out Candace Owen's. You will be amazed qt what she has found out about Kamala and her claim to be black, which she is far from."
2.1 million views and 99.9% of us see a lunatic pathological lying hyena of a woman with a scary crazy laugh thats horrifically unqualified.<br><br>TRUMP 2024
it's bad when my brother and I work 60 hours a week at twenty one dollars an hour and still struggle our dreams are just hoping to keep a roof over our heads and afford bills and groceries

If she wins we know for a fact out voting system is rigged
She can’t answer questions directly. She cannot be president
I'm so confused as to why this is a serious conversation being had in the US. It's so obvious how clueless this woman is yet I keep hearing people jeer her on like a bard in Skyrim.
She is a  jokeand her supporters are the same.before the clowns start.i dont follow Republicans or democrats.both are a joke and only care about themselves not the people's
She is stupid
What the hell did she just try to tell us??????
"I would just LOVE to watch & listen to the media Democrat Socialists if Trump wins in a landslide, both in the Electoral College AND the popular vote."
HOLISTICALLY IS A GREAT WORD...BACK OFF BITCHES
She's lie's about everything and blames it' on Trump.Her and Biden fucked up America.everybody no's that.there going to try to rig it again.and the Kennedy's voters goes to Donald trump.
"her and walz ""dumb and dumber"""
The American ppl are not Willie Brown. Don’t talk to us like we are some “JOHN” and your making your sale
"Y mira con quien se codea la kamala?? Con la Cabra de Opra ,??? Pura basura la rodea!!!"
Kamala cant even think on her feet no backbone.
Trump & Vance 2024 🙏<br>Thank you Sky News Australia 💖
Dumbest presidential candidate EVER!
Kamala is the anti christ….
She has no clue about finance  she talks  so much B S. Lies to cover their bad  management
The survival of Western Civilization lies in the fickle hands of women voters!
Im inspired  to vote  for  president  Trump  not simpieton kamula  🎉
She don't care about this country.
She don't care about this country.
🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Why would anybody  vote  for  lying  kamala  ?
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fire"">#Fire</a>-kamala"
"Biden/Harris has raided FEMA to support illegal aliens, now FEMA is broke! Your should check out her response to the hrricane damage in the southeast"
She’s dangerous
Truly clueless
"Kamala,  really??? Hard working isnt a trait of the black community. Two parent family isnt a trait of the black comunity. Raising your kids to be tax paying contributing members of society is not a trait of the black community.<br>What are traits of the current black comunity are criminal activity, laziness, no ambition, aspirations, and joy!!! Ha, sound familiar. Kamala, get out of bed on time, read your briefs, address your advisors, listen and learn!!!  You want to be black, then you are a microcosm of that by your own actions of lies and excuses!"
Holistic Cow
It's evident she knows positively nothing about anything!<br>..
"TYPICAL DEMOCRAT, LIE AND DENY"
"As a 61-year-old woman, I've seen a lot go on in this country. I would love to see a woman in office, but this woman is not the woman to put there. She lies she can't even get a sentence out without using word salads. She has no idea what's going on. She opened the border and flooded our country with illegal immigrants who are criminals who are killing our people. She's allowed more fentanyl into this country than anybody else.  Which is also killing our people. She's just not the right woman for this job. She wasn't the right woman to be Vice President. Let alone President and unfortunately, because our President is in continent right now and has absolutely no brain. Left his wife and this woman. Kamala are running our country. It's wake up America, vote Trump."
Not true you lame😅
"A lying politician, that's why Trump the business man got my vote"
There was a girl that I knew that tried to impress me by learning a new word every day.  But it only upset me more. I disliked here even more. She was once my best. But vastly grew apart.
She sounds like a teenage beauty pageant contestant
My god isnt the thick
"All I ask, is that if Kamala gets voted in, please, world, please, don't act like all Americans voted for her.  Be kind to those of us who voted against her, please. 🥺"
I hate the words holistic and aspirations.
"Dreams like religion are falicys, delusions or just that dreams. You cannot make them real no matter how much you want, try, pray. The American dream was a phrase in a book that more applied to liberty freedom opportunity to a point. But has been twisted to mean money, cars, homes status. But again it's a fictional phelosophy and a phelosophy depends on understanding, customs, religion, social status upbringing and so on. It's fluid not rigid and based on interpretation.. People need to live in reality these things are destroying humanity. Not that that's a bad thing. All perspectives"
I am supporting TRUMP HOLISTICALLY!!!😂
"D.TRUMP will be our next president AMERICA, Thank God!!!!!!!!!"
"As an Aussie, I feel for my American friends with this embarrassment of a candidate. She’s bat shit crazy 🤪 Best of luck guys 🙄❤️"
She has no answer. Period!
My closed captioning must be controlled by those 'racist' right wingers. It never did get her name correct!
She’s not saying anything wrong
Skynews for the WIN!
"Kamala belongs in the junkyard...disgusting persona , and two faced low moral decadent witch."
She is basically the president NOW and ain't doing shit and that is what she will do if elected.
Aren't we all ready to turn the page with Kamala??......   😒🤣
"stephanie, please undie your hair color, it makes you look older."
She is done she is full of crap incredibly bad policies Trump landslide
"The economy was beginning to boom during DJT's term, and things had begun to stabilize."
"""Holistically"" speaking, I am holistically underwhelmed by her holistic word-salads."
She never got one delegate …. She fell into it !
Never underestimate a democrat’s ability to lie.
Holistic she's holistically involved she's holistically involved in housing holistically taking her holistic lifestyle
Lies lies and lies. She lies.
I’m An American for my entire life but I’d leave in a heartbeat because I don’t have to put up with this hypocrisy and blatant lies and propaganda against white peoples
"I think North Carolina will be for Trump, especially after the massive failure from the gov to assist the people from the historic floods.  FEMA is confiscating goods surrounding people have sent to them and threatening arrests if anyone tries to help rescue. That’s not who we are in the Appalachian Mountains."
Still better than voting for a felon! <br>Trump's a douchebag idiot lying piece of sh*t. Can't wait for him to go to prison.
Faken UN BEE LEIV ABLE
"All those suffering from the Horrendous, hurricane need more than Dreams, ambitions, goals, aspirations and holistically to get their lives back on track <br>Biden/Harris should be ashamed of how these people have been treated ,,they are Americans but immigrants are looked after better , FEMA has run out of money due to immigration nothing left for the hurting people of the hurricane,,,,remember this and vote trump/Vance ❤❤❤"
People's I.Q's drop listening to this inarticulate & incoherent Kamel Toe speak.
She basically said you’ll do as she wants and it doesn’t matter if you want it
Shes failed upwards so much that she actually thinks she deserves to fail upwards again…
Time to DIVORCE Kamala and keep her out of the White House 😊😊
"Inspire us, by inspiring us and we continue to inspire us HOW1"
She wears the same clothes. Same earings everytime.
"“ If you’re hard working and have dreams and aspirations, you’re in my plan”. Thats terrifying. Shes coming for you!"
I have never seen a person talk so much and say absolutely so little of any value
Workd leaders will PASS HER AROUND like all sharpton did when she was his call girl back in the day al was a drug dealer and PIMP!!!
"Headboard harris is an ""ADDICT ""ALCOHOL AND DRUGS FOR DECADES NOW.WE DONT WANT YET ANOTHER ""ADDICT ""IN POWER"
Time for voter fraud to save the day!
"If she ran for mayor of Madison Wisconsin, she'd win. These brain dead morons just love her."
"the deep state needs a puppet ,what a git"
I dreamed your gone!
Opera need to be investigated
...love the background for the interview...someone's little workshop...is that made to code ?...
"...I think she caught it from Joey...she is suffering from a severe case of ""BRAIN FARTS""...<br>   and if you are smart enough to notice what she has done for the border...it is nothing short of TREASON !!!<br>   ...ILLEGAL (look it up) aliens have received housing, funding, and more benefits then American citizens...<br>   Please look up the definition of the word TREASON !, and open your eyes to what a traitor she and the<br>   administration are...they're not in it for U.S. ..."
"No way in hell would I vote for Kruelmala Harris and yes , yes I would only vote for Trump ♥️ Trump 💯"
The nanny with the broom from Tom and Jerry would be better than KH
"MSNBC is a wholly Democratic Party whitewash facility, if this bimbo suffers under their soft touch, she’s no match for even a 17 year old political debater, let alone seasoned veterans."
She cannot become president of the United States...ever!
"This is the game; <br>get her polling figures up using fake polls, then flood the ballot boxes with fake ballots and votes from illegal migrants....prevent all independent or even bipartisan scrutiny of the count and then steal another election....to be honest neither of them really represent the will of the people. Who wants  neverending wars ?"
Kamala's most important political advisor is her dental hygienist !
Happy ones like uppers
She is on drugs
Don't just look at Harris look at the 2nd Lady Walz turning pages and how she explained it. These DEMORATS NEED MENTAL HEALTH APPOINTMENTS.
"If she wins, WE ARE ALL FUCKED"
Never mind I saw her wedding ring it just doesn't have a rock on his very flat😂
And wait a minute I thought she was married where's her wedding ring
I think we all know who's gonna be president 😮‍💨
She wants you to work hard so you can pay for her illegals.
We are convinced that she is a Liar!
"I am not from USA, but hell - then you look at Roosevelt and practically every president until 80-ies, and then you look at ""this""...strange feeling"
The poll is not 🚫 the people
RITA WE LOVE YOU  YOU CAN SEE HOW CORRUPT THE DEMOCRAT PARTY ARE SO CAN I AND KARMILA HARRIS FLEW OVER THE COOKOOS NEST SHE IS A GOOD ACTRESS WITH FAKE CHARM AND VERY CRUEL SHE SHOULD BE IMPEACHED  FOR FLYING MORE ILEGAL IMAGRANTS IN BY BIG JUMBO JETS  AND BLOOD ON HER HANDS FOR DEATHS AND 325 MISSING CHILDREN DONALD TRUMP IS INNOCENT OF THOSE COURT CHARGES  SHE WAS BEHIND THEM TO GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY WAKE UP AMERICA  VOTE TRUMP VANCE ❤❤❤

She needs to word salad a little better..give it some ranch and croutons Already. She's Ignorant
Let me guess Trump paid you. Trump no better. Its a shame that America can't find a good Presidential candidate
"Firstly this woman on the news panel SHOUTS TOO MUCH. Now about Kamala, I would think she couldn't run for a bus let alone a presidency. God help the USA if this idiotic woman gets in  she's a danger because she pretends to know about government and will cause many troubles for their country. She talks but says absolutely  NOTHING except B.S. ."
How could she ever have an interview with Putin . She was once in Poland . She laughs all the time through her stupid attempt to deliver a speech .
Get your. Poses out of tRUMPS RUMP!!!
"Cannot listen to this nasa lvoice .  ,Well one can hear how she is thinking ."
"She talks nonsense, just like Biden, but he had dementia, what's her excuse.<br>Thick as a plank."
I'm not sure what she's saying
Two choices hmmmm I’m getting 2016 flashbacks. My answer will be the same as it was back then. I’m for Trump so world war 3 doesn’t happen
Lie lie lie
Dumb woman
It's crazy I have to get real news about America from Australia
This woman talks like a second grade kid just searching for words
"This is liyi g and hate speech  towards the truth sayer trump,,  she doesn't even believe her lies herself,,,WATCH HER SHAKING HER HEAD ITS ACTUALLY SAYING NO NO NO ,,IM LIYING"
Get a life. She is a wonderful job❤
I am a Democrat that will not be voting for kamala
"DONALD TRUMP IS THE ONLY PRESIDENT OF AMERICA WHO CAN HELP THE US ECONOMY<br>HEIS A GOOD BUSINESSMAN AND VERY INTELLIGENT AND KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH OTHER <a href=""http://govt.in/"">GOVT.IN</a> OTHER COUNTRY <br>D.TRUMP WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN"
"We do not need her Go Trump <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k90LSk70ckU&t=664"">11:04</a>"
"Harris should start a new career in the cartoon looney tunes  what a nut, americans"
''Empty in her fullness like a frozen pantomime''
I don't consider myself very smart n she is sooo stupid to me. I cannot how ignorant she comes across to a really intellegent person!!! So so sad. The USA is going down thanks to biden n this nit wit! My heart goes out to the hurricane victims. Bad enough with the help of fema but no fema what is going to happen?😢
Not to sure if NC will be voting blue cause no government are helping the western part of the state after Helene. People are actually seeing that. They are reporting that elon musk has given them at least star link to communicate with the outside world
the McDonald's and the fake grandmother and listening to Tupac in 88 its all a lie
Ka’Mammy Harris is a <b>LIAR</b>
"Oh wow, you should be discucted Australian media. Wow, let's let Trump run the free world😅  You bunch of grubs😢"
"Shut up Kamala you’re giving SALAD a bad name, when she opens her mouth she sprouts VERBAL VOMIT 😳"
"If Kamala was slapped each time she lied, her nose wold be on her left ear."
The problem with pathological lying is people like her actually start believing themselves as evidences by word 🥗 salads.<br>Waaaay toooooo muccch!!!🎉🎉🎉🎉😮😂😅😢😮🎉😂😮😢🎉😂😅😅😮🎉🎉😢😮😅😮🎉😂🎉😅😮😮😮😮
This brings new meaning to being drop dead dumb!!!
Apparently Willy isn’t the only one with a hand in her
"One question, isn't there an iq test and minimum iq standard to become President? I am Dutch and see Kamala Harris, for me her iq is like that of a 12 y.o. kid."
"Harris is  a train wreck vote Trump and  Vance period, save America!"
Sad
She's flairing those nostrils
How in the H3LL could anyone with a brain cell vote for this DUNCE!
Fake Republican shit.....go ahead vote for the felon
"Democrats insist on insulting the Voter. We have a memory birtch, and your the birtch we remember."
BOTH THESE 2 IDIOTS ARE ON A SCRIPT. HARRIS IS STUPID AND THE INTERVIEWER  HATES TRUMP AND ANYTHING GOES TO MAKE HARRIS LOOK GOID. WHICH FAILS MISERABLY
I sware she needs to stay out of Hunter Bidens cocaine.
Willie Brown's #2 ho'. She wasn't even his #1 ho'.
I thought she was praised for being a good speaker. Seriously?! 😂😂😂
DEI operative.
"The only People voting for Her are very weak minded, victim perpetrating, perverted, clueless idiots. No pity for those types, simply the weakest links of society"
"Ego<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/shorts/44ADUBcEWz4"">https://youtube.com/shorts/44ADUBcEWz4?si=e9hIcWs9U1PgcQ6X</a>"
Camel is useless Worthless Brain dead garbage
America - what the hell is wrong with you? How can you even contemplate supporting a nomination as President of the United States such as this ridiculous woman?
"Camel-face Harris wasn't anywhere near ""raveled"" in the first place, lol. She's got more than a few screws loose, the he/she creature. She makes Ped0 Joe look like a Mensa candidate."
TRUMP 2024 🇺🇲❤️🇺🇲❤️<br>SHE'S AN IDIOT!!!
"Holistic is not anything that im looking for in a president. She may talk ""better"" than Joe, but she sure as hell doesnt say anything smarter or  meaningful."
Word salad. 😂😅
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤LOVE USA 🇺🇸 ❤ PRESIDENT TRUMP ❤ 💙 💜 ♥ 🙌 💕 ❤ 💙 💜 ♥ 🙌 💕 ❤ 💙 💜 ♥ 🙌 💕 ❤ ❤ 💙 💜 ♥ ❤ 💙 💜 ♥ 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
She's an idiot
Population control is what Kamala is all about
Unraveling? This woman has been unraveled. She took over 1B dollars in FEMA funds and helped the migrant relief with it. Now FEMA is stating they don’t have enough funds to make it through hurricane season. Is anyone going to help NC right now. Those poor people paid into their taxes and get nothing back when disaster hits. And it’s Disney Land for all migrants. This is F**cked up!
I would love to know why her running mate's whole family is against him?
TRUMP 2024🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲👍👏🙏❤️❤️❤️
"Typical Sky News style...(cringe) like some critique of a footy match. Nothing intelligent here. Like a mob of crows tearing the eyes and entrails out of their victim. How about some comparison with Trump who is the most deceitful, evil and moronic presidential candidate ever. Think forward to how the state of the world and life in America will be 6 months after the election.... Idiots !!!"
I'm getting really goddamn tired of this stop sending my money overseas I don't see any of those other countries sending money over here stop sending my money everywhere else take care of United States first and foremost
She is holistically stupid 😂
She’s a drunk
Jow you like her face humgaryfor s🤐
BAISED NETWORK
Fox News must interview her father.
Trump 2024
We have three choices the doctor Cornel West for president of the United States in 2024 why y'all neglected to talk about Dr Cornel West y'all some ignorant ass people!
"Holistically speaking,  not a single intelligent neuron in your brain,  you are unfit  and unqualified as VP, that says all."
Kamala’s Proof-Positive that an Intracranial 100% Pure VACUUM CAN EXIST Outside a Laboratory Situation..!!!🇺🇸
Trump as inspired me to vote for Harris…. 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
She'd sell out anyone with a lie
THANK YOU FOR THESE EYE OPENING FAILURES OF KAMALA HARRIS!!  SHE IS A DESASTER FOR AMERICA!!!
She's talking out of her a$$.
Sky news making anti coporate tax propaganda do be a thing tho :D
She's spends a lot of time on word salads...nothing meaningful or substantial.
Anybody remember the tabloids?
She is a airhead
I don't like the background music. Otherwise I love Sky.
"Is so sad that people  care only about the color, gender or party and no care about brain.😢"
shut up look in 2016 thru trump look at the last 4 yrs get your head of the sand
What would Kamala know about work …She has failed in every job she ever had …the only thing she’s mastered is lying ‼️Hopefully Americans will wake-up in time to vote for Mr Trump 💯‼️🇺🇸Save our Republic 🇺🇸
😮 what is the holistic economy plan?
"Scamala is a pathological liar !!  Just believe the opposite of what she, msm, the view and all far left say!!!"
Only a foolish person who lacks ANY intelligence would vote for Kamela and the Democrats...
I think she’s holistically high as $hit! 😂
I’m so sick pig hearing her voice 😡 well and her stupidity
Thank God Great America does not respect habitual liars.<br>Tell those critics to look after their country wherein numerous countries especially Jamaica (Kamala's father is Jamaican) who have plans to make Jamaica independent of UK.<br>Look at precisely what is going on there with those leeches.
Wtf how is this on the news? Holistic is a word. A simple google and Rita would have learned that 😂
"Corporate taxes hurt local businesses, people forget that whether they have 2 employees or 2 million its a corporation, and they all get taxed at a flat rate before Trump, that was 35% Trump lowered that to be 25%. Should also say corporate taxes have 0 effect on extremely wealthy people all it does is drive up costs you dumb twit"
Reminds me of Frank Burns from MASH - It’s nice to be nice to the nice 😂😂😂
Big big liar. Typical of what we call “itik” people
Please select a person who speaks clearly and smoothly and not a liar.<br>All know Trump is also a habitual liar.<br>Why would anyone constantly interview with the absolute enemy?
And Child care is child care 😂 Australia has the worst justice system and should be more concerned abort that than our election. 😂
Sky News is obnoxious
Booba😅
The left is run by incompetent people 😮
A duh😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It is bad when CNN is calling out a democrat for being a liar😂
If She wins it will ge a testimony for Americans becoming really stupid. Too stupid to be considered as the superpower of the world..
I smell bull💩😂 CHUMP is losing again. 🗳💙
MAGA!
"The people who want to vote for Kamala Harris have every right to do so if they want to, I think they should find a toxic waste dump and all go there and live quite happily"
Let’s talk about her always wearing the SAME earrings. Let’s reveal if they are earphones and being fed what to say.
LIES LIES LIES!!!!
Why is Australia obsessed with American Politics? Go pet a kangaroo
How selfish Camila should be to participate in election👎👎👎
IM ABSOLUTELY VOTING FOR TRUMP WITHOUT QUESTION ⁉️
Scary lack of depth.
All of her stupid answers are you all you are going to get.  What psyche did she escape from?
I'm inspired to be inspired in the future to be inspired to inspire others to inspire me.
"Absolutely, Trump is a better choice for the economy."
"When you listen to her, don’t you feel like inserting  a bullet Manually?!<br>The Biggest Loon In History 😢"
IF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE DON'T VOTE FOR THIS STUPID BTCH HARRIS
I will suck a dick for a vote
Tired of this one-sided channel. No class. She could still win....
CERTIFIED NUTCASE= KAMALA KINTE
Where our tax money goes 😂😂😂😂😂😊
Another democrat / communist. Empty brain
West of time 😢😢😢😢
She just stupid 😢😢😢😢😢
Rise taxes wow
Just wait you think cereal 5 dollors it will be 10
Note how when Trump was in office the cost of living didn't change? It didn't go down but it didn't go up either.  She's just trying to weaponize that he was born into wealth to win more votes.
The only people I've met that praise her have 0 clue how anything works. <br>They think day 1 she'll legalize marijuana on a federal level and make abortion legal on a federal level. <br>Somehow these people think that everyone that didn't vote democrat is intentionally out to get them.
"No plan, no idea, clueless, kaMULA  <br>Is still very burden by what has been,"
"Tiered, of this administration! Democrats  destroyed our country .,,Trump 2O24"
Sorry but ain’t she a Marxist
I like Kamala. Not a criminal like Trump.
Kamala: darn where s obama?? !!
Please pronounce her name correctly.
Leave her along people are so bias against her cuz of her race
Unraveling she’s been a damn loser from the beginning
Do you have a video of Harris scoffing at FEMA Meeting when questioned about the Hurricane tragedy?  I can’t remember where I heard it but did she make a comment saying the red states were effected by the hurricane we’re mostly red which will effect Trumps votes?  She was boasting.  I don’t recall the exact words but the jest of it.  I wish I would have saved it when I saw it.  It enraged me at the time.  She is evil.  Watch  Candace Owens investigation on Harris’s book against the facts regarding her family. It’s in 4-5 video’s There are a lot of holes in the truth regarding her parents and family providing that she is lying about being black roots.
Lock up Kamala with Joe the joke
"If Trump wins, it won't be because his supporters outnumbered Kamala's supporters, it'll be because Kamala is so utterly dull-witted and incompetent that not even her supporters wanted to vote for her. Like srsly, even that goofy AI generated Kamala campaign ad sounded more coherent and confident than the real Kamala. <br><br>Edit: I just realized Kamala is pretty much George Bush 2.0 from how many ""Bushisms"" she's been saying... Should we rebrand them to Kamalisms or Harrisms now?"
"You can see in her eyes that she's ins a dream. Man ,it gives me chills guys 😮"
So she can tax you be hard woʻrkers
She's fake
This 😂 is a joke
TRUMPS IDIOCY IS UNPARALLELED.
Holistic BULLSHIT.
TALK ABOUT BIASED REPORTING!!
WTF 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
"Wow, even CNN fact checked her...When CNN goes against its favorite party, you know Harris is an issue... a bad word salad, with a side of lies!"
All lies KAMALA😴
TRUMP 🇺🇲VANCE🇺🇲🙏🏻🌹🙏🇺🇸
Somebody should choke on that much word salad! Puke! 🤮
"K, you little sky net muskrat looking b. Stick to your own country. No one cares about your opinions in the US."
One choice....I am voting for President Trump!! I do not believe anything ABC or NBC says or any of their lying polls!!
By the way she didn't grow up middle class.... Candace has facts. Her family had servants.
Go watch Candace. Kammy lied in her book about her family. The picture with her grandmother is fake because her grandmother died before she was born.
😂❤
"She needs to be fully scripted at all times, she cannot field questions that were not pre approved for her to answer."
Kamal is a marxist liar!
She is totally unqualified to be in politics period.
GO AND BUY A TWO DOLLAR BILL FROM TRAMP trump FOR $ 20.00  RETARDED DEGENERATE maga MONKEY'S.
LMFAO 😂😂😂
"Its odd that the Democrats want a women as prisdent when they still know what a women 😳 is . <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k90LSk70ckU&t=81"">1:21</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k90LSk70ckU&t=97"">1:37</a>"

Trumps looking at 10 years lmao

Bizarre!
Kamala Holistically kiss my Keester.

It is really sad to see the democrats couldn't come up with better candidate
No we the best till the virus
Bitch lied
Dumb as a 🧰 😂
Oh how intellectually superior you guys think to be but you call Hamas terrorists. Replication of western propaganda.What about critical thinking
"After listening to the kids in college, none of them have a brain big enough to vote. Cum On man, be real. Even after they learn that she lies about almost everything they still say, Oh yeah, I'm still not voting for Trump."
Idiot if anybody wants 4 more of this Must be an Idiot as Well !
"Shaking her head no as she is speaking is because she is fighting with her own brain to say something that is not in it. In other words, she is lying to her herself into the world. It’s very evident to see from her facial expression, her eye movement, and her body language. She’s a fake."
Idiot!!!!!!!!!!!
She is such a liar!
"Who doesn't think Kamala was going to say we (we, not her) will all have to pay more taxes? She caught herself in time, but we know what was coming."
Journo is the problem... If you vote for Kamala Harris... You are the problem! What a freaking joke she is!
I refuse to watch ANYTHING screaming Storer discusses.  😮😮😮😮
she talks and talks and doesnt really say anything
Harris the natural liar!
Does Storer have a hearing problem?
"What a joke. All she does is blame Trump for everything. Not smart enough to run this country. The media will protect her. If you trust poll numbers from the media, your an idiot."
Yes Kamala. We do have dreams and aspirations. What we need is money to fund those dreams and aspirations.
Is it not obvious. Have you not figured out yet the media is mostly owned by the left and George Soros in America. No he didn't sweet heart. You guys screwed up the country. All lies Kamala!
"Seems like every questions is "" Kamala, how do you deal with being so great?"" and every answer is :  (kackle) ""Well you know, I was born. And as I grew older, I grew larger in my middle class (not) household, unburdened by what has been"". (kay)"
Duhh
So full of crap. If you don't like trump vote for the libertarian candidate. At least he's not a complete doofus and liar. Worthless except to continue to kill Americans and give our country away!
"do you viewers not understand that Kamala Harris is the only person with a background to be president, Lawyer, AG Cali, Senator, and vice president for last four years.. Name Trumps background??"
I think the phrase ‘word salad’ entails more discernible distinct colours and shapes than what Kamala serves up.<br><br>She’s more your word meatloaf kinda of operator.<br><br>You don’t make friends with salad.
What a load of shit FOX NEWS --FOX Not News
Kamala definitely ain’t no Hola Back girl. She comes more with that ‘off brand’ wafflin’ nonsense flo.
TRUMP 🇺🇲❤🇺🇲 MAGA!!!!
I think she'll be elected. ☹
Hahaha 😝
"As I recall, Trump had the economy at its strongest since Obama's attempt to destroy America."
"A certain gender doesn't make anybody better. Male or female, integrity, honesty and real experience counts. Trump might've made some errors, fumbled horribly but wants the best for the people, and that's what counts, the people, not the past. Progression is having something to bring to the table. Trump has always said, don't let your enemies know too much, or we'll be left with too little again. Keep your mouth shut, like Trump says, and just do it when the time comes to follow through for your country. Don't hide in the basement. Or be hungover some place, speaking in word salad code..🎩😡👎"
Kamala is the biggest ‘Box Car Willie’ President-in-waiting of all time.<br><br>Her credibility in the squared circle makes Joe Biden look like Oscar De La Hoya.<br><br>…which is saying something
Idiot
Joking laughing on oprah after that parent was crying was heartless
Don’t listen to this
I think it’s unreasonable to claim that Kamala has ‘unraveled’….there’s never been any evidence she was ‘ravelled’ to begin with.
"Kamala quality is🖕, ship this fool out to a sh*thole country for good."
We did’t pay $4.00 for a docen of eggs when Trump was a president.
Y'all must be trump crash dummies 😅
That  B-I-M-B-O is going to be POTUS....   GOD HELP US...
Dumbest human I ever hears speak above 2
Well somebody must've edited this while asleep
Ugh….such vomit!
"Then you guys must be extremely concerned about Trump and his constant nonsensical word salads.  I've actually never heard her speak nonsensically so are these just snippets you've put together to sound bad?  Remember, Trump inherited a great economy and destroyed us is about 3 1/2 years.  The whole country was shut down and we've been paying for his poor decisions ever since!  Where have you people been hiding or are you just putting out mixed lies and messages to support your own agenda?"
Liar false claim loser had fact check
It’s just so sad that it’s Trump rage and not what is best for the country!!!
Sounds like Harris is just trying to be a life coach
Christians support Harris...like it or not.
Just VOTE Trump/Vance!!!!! Let’s take America back please!!!!!!!❤❤❤
Not true
"WORTH THE LONG READ...<br>THIS IS WHO KAMALA HARRIS REALLY IS!<br><br>The History of Kamala Harris<br>by Geoffrey B. Higginbotham <br>Major General, USMC (Ret.)<br>  <br>For your knowledge and interest about the Biden Vice President, Kamala Harris.  Here is a timely editorial that exposes the hidden background of Kamala Harris from the Combat Veterans for Congress Political Action Committee that is posted here with permission of the author. CVFC PAC supports the election of US military combat veterans to the US Senate and House of Representatives. The editorial begins: <br><br>Kamala Harris' father was an avowed Marxist professor in the Economics Department at Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA. Both of Harris' parents were active in the Berkeley based Afro-American Association; Fidel Castro and Che Guevara were the heroes of the Afro-American Association. <br><br>The group's leader, Donald Warden (aka Khalid al-Mansour), mentored two young Afro-American Association members, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale; they created the Maoist inspired Black Panther Party which gained strong support from Communist China; the Black Panther Party served as the model for creation of the Black Lives Matter Marxist organization Khalid al-Mansour subsequently went on to arrange financing and facilitated for Barack Hussein Obama to be accepted as a student to matriculate at Harvard Law School. <br><br>Following her graduation from college, Harris returned to California and subsequently became the mistress of the 60-year-old married Speaker of the California Assembly, Willie Brown, Jr. Brown's political campaigns were supported and funded by Dr. Carlton Goodlett, the owner of The Sun Reporter and several other pro-Communist newspapers. <br><br>Brown was elected as Mayor of San Francisco, and strongly endorsed Harris' Marxist political philosophy; he guided Harris' political rise in California politics, leading to her election as California's Attorney General. Willie Brown, Jr. was a well-known long-time Communist sympathizer. Willie Brown, Jr. was initially elected to public office with the substantial help of the Communist Party USA. <br><br>Today, Willie Brown is widely regarded as one of the Chinese Communist Party's best friends in the San Francisco Bay Area. <br><br>While serving as San Francisco District Attorney, Kamala Harris mentored a young San Francisco Radical Maoist activist, Lateefah Simon, who was a member of the STORM Revolutionary Movement; Simon currently chairs the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Board. Simon has always been close friends with the founder of Black Lives Matter Marxist Domestic Terrorists, Alicia Garza, as well as STORM member and avowed Communist, Van Jones. Harris has been openly and aggressively supporting Black Lives Matter Marxists; Kamala Harris is still closely associated with Maoist Lateefah Simon and Marxist Alicia Garza. <br><br>Kamala Harris's sister Maya Harris was a student activist at Stanford University. She was a closely associated with Steve Phillips, one of the leading Marxist-Leninists on campus and a long-time affiliate with the League of Revolutionary Struggle, a pro-Chinese Communist group. <br><br>Phillips came out of the Left, and in college he studied Marx, Mao, and Lenin, and maintained close associations with fellow Communists. Phillips married into the multibillion-dollar Sandler family of the Golden West Savings and Loan fortune. He funded many leftist political campaigns, and voter registration drives in the Southern and South Western states in order to help his friend, Barack Hussein Obama, defeat Hillary Clinton. Phillips has been a major financial sponsor for Kamala Harris's political campaigns for various California elective offices plus Cory Booker, Andrew Gillum, Stacey Abrams to name a few. <br><br>Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff works for the law firm DLA Piper, which ""boasts nearly 30 years of experience in Communist China with over 140 lawyers dedicated to its 'Communist China investment Services' branch. He was just appointed Professor at Yale to school future lawyers in the fine points of Communism.<br>When she was elected to the US Senate, Kamala Harris appointed a Pro-Communist Senate Chief of Staff, Karine Jean-Pierre. Jean-Pierre was active with the New York-based Haiti Support Network. The organization worked closely with the pro-Communist China/Communist North Korea Workers World Party and supported Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the far-left Communist former president of Haiti and the radical Lavalas movement. <br><br>Fortunately for Harris, but potentially disastrous for the Republic, elected office holders are not subject to the security clearance process. If the FBI did a Background Investigation on Kamala Harris, she never would have passed, because of her 40-year close ties with Marxists, Communists, Maoists, and Communist China. Harris would never have been approved for acceptance to any of the 5 Military Service Academies, been appointed to a US Government Sub-Cabinet position, or would have been approved to fill a sensitive position for a high security defense contractor. Yet, since Joe Biden was elected, Harris could be a heartbeat away from being President. <br><br>The US constitutional Republic is being threatened by the People's Republic of Communist China (PPC) externally, and by their very active espionage operations within the United States. The People's Republic of Communist China (PPC), with 1.4 billion people, is governed by the 90 million member Chinese Communist Party (CCP), that has been working with Russia to destroy the US Constitutional Republic for over 70 years. <br><br>If the American voters read the background information (in Trevor Loudon's article) on Kamala Harris, they would never support her election as Vice President of the United States. Joe Biden is suffering from the early onset of dementia and will continue to decline in cerebral awareness; he will never be able to fill out a four-year term of office.<br>Since Biden was elected, the Socialists, Marxists, and Communist who control Kamala Harris, are planning to enact provisions of the 25th Amendment, in order to remove Joe Biden from office, so Harris can become the first Communist President of the United States. <br><br>Since Biden was elected, because Biden would not be up to it, Kamala Harris would lead the effort to appoint very dangerous anti-American Leftist, Communist, Socialists, and Marxists to fill highly sensitive positions in the Washington Deep State Bureaucracy. She would fill all appointive positions in the US Intelligence Agencies, in the Department of Homeland Security, in the Department of Defense, in The Justice Department, the Department of State, the FBI, the CIA, most cabinet positions, the National Security Council, and in the White House Staff. <br><br>American voters must alert their fellow Americans that Kamala Harris is a very serious National Security threat to the very survival of the US Constitutional Republic; she has been a fellow traveler of Marxists, Communists, Maoists, Socialists, Progressives, and Chinese Communists for over 35 years.<br>President Trump had much more background information on Kamala Harris than we presented here, and he was correct, when he accused Kamala Harris of being a Communist subverter. <br><br>Geoffrey B. Higginbotham <br>Major General, USMC (Ret.)"
look up her videos with the Mayor back in the day... you will see how she got to capitol hill.
She is a frigging idiot !! <br>TRUMP 2024
Youd think the people of a state supporting Kammy would be too embarrassed to announce it publicly
Cumala is a  LAD
She and biden should be in prison...they are criminals!!!
"Kamala only cares about Kamala. She lives in an ivory tower. She’s not gonna help the people in North Carolina because they’re probably not gonna even be able to vote because there’s no electricity no power and it’s probably the votes would go to Trump and she doesn’t want that so she’s not gonna help them. She could sell her money out of her pocket too. This whole thing doesn’t affect her personally and it’s all about Kamala and the left-wing agenda! She doesn’t give a rats ass about the Americans. She only cares about the immigrants that stay in these palatial hotels while literary is out on the street sleeping. It’s so backwards so crazy. Reminds me of the movie China cry. She’s a damn dictator she’s the one that’s a threat to democracy, and we all know it. The American people know it!"
Is she still transporting  her fans state to state
"Shame on the U.S MARINES attached to the white house detail, I would take a DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE before showing any Respect to the TRUE DOES ENEMY!!! SHAME ON YOU WHITE HOUSE MARINES!!! DISGRACE!!"

What an idiot
"Deep state better start running, guamtomino is putting the sheets on.....😅"
She is pathetic
Go back into your play pen what a there is no words for this whatever it is 🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉
"Kamala Harris does not put herself in front of the media, her handlers tell her to stay away from the media and they work around that. The Democratic Party kept her undercover for two years because she was an embarrassment. Now she’s like the holy savior. The Democratic Party is desperate and fractured. And if people vote for her because of her color or her gender are losers to begin with.<br>We are at the brink of a Middle East war and the current  administration has done nothing to even come close to fixing it. <br>Just vote with your brains and not your ignorance."
Keep fighting Trump 🎉
Holistically  does she  know  what  that mean  rambling Bull _ _ _  _
Holistically stupid how's her grass these days is it better than her neighbors

Trump."
"They only voting for her because they hate Trump,really bad way to vote. Trump has policy's Kamala has excuses and  babbles about nonsense."
She is a idiot  😂
Ruhl is absolutely  right.<br>Kamala is NOT running for perfect.<br>She's  running for PRESIDENT.
"Yes she has dreams only for the illegal border crossers, a bit like prim minster Albanese."
Mark is angry. I would never vote for anyone sngry . Again   Dems are 😂Angry peeps!!!!😅

Damn near worse than Biden 😂 she don’t know wtf to say
Finally somebody who is being honest instead of sucking up to a super suspect puppet candidate who doesn’t even seem sure of herself
Corporations don't pay taxes WE DO!!!! TALK KAMALA.... WHATS YOUR PLAN???? AND FOR THAT REASON SHE WILL NOT GET MY VOTE
"Kamala Harris doesn't know any about being a president, she also lies about every single thing, always blaming Trump when gas prices and everything else was a lot cheaper and there was no war.  She hates America and the American people, she is a dictator and only helps the terrorists organization,  her goal is to destroy America, she worships Satan,  all her plans are going to create disaster after disaster,  is the FBI, CIA, DOJ,  HOMELAND SECURITY, BORDER PATROL, etc are these people betraying America and the Americans people on a deals that is  nothing but lies, words of a advice, don't listen to those who worship Satan, all lies to set you up.  Kamala Harris,  your children have NO future, she wants to change everything  that is a sin against God.  🙏 to God, the evilness has spread like a virus."
Such ignorance upon us.

"06:00 pm Oregon, USA...<br>I am a proud and true Republican! <br>She is an embarrassment to our country!<br>Pray for our country!"
Why is she shaking her head 'no' through the entire answer?
"When she brings up her hands,  she is very nervous, but when she brings up her hands & moves them around that way, it looks like she's tossing salad words hoping they'll form a sentence."
"Dog shit is better than Trump. But her’s a woman with a Doctorate in Jurisprudence, has decades of experience in the political sphere. Anyone voting for Trump is a fool"
Kamala what a disgrace
"How can the polls in swing states be tied and she’s even ahead in some?? Answer: Media Lies!!! She stopped herself from saying of course I’m raising taxes on the middle class, where else am I’m going to get the $ from??"
Bull shit on Sky as usual.

I will not be spending one more penny on any famous people products..YES Republican celebs too. They will not take a stand & they've seemingly forgotten they were once like us. Struggling & at the MERCY of our law makers. Vote Trump if you really care about your country, this isn't a popularity contest. This is our lives friends."

"She is like a chameleon that blends in with her audiences, and this is heard when she speaks with fake accents when speaking to certain people. She is... <br>Khameleon Harass."
She has no fucking idea what it takes to be an American a patriot or even a good person. She’s freaking stupid. She can’t carry a conversation and she can’t even make a decent sentence. God help us.
Sad that she was so little intellect.    Not a leader in any capacity.
She can't answer anything because she is a dummy!
She always looks drunk
"It’s it only sad,it’s scarey that some one so I’ll equipped for Presidency could win😈Vice Pres is not for her either! Biden was bad enough!?can’t have more of the same for 4 more years!?👁pay attention voters!!"

"The United States is the laughing stock of the world. If she is elected it will prove how stupid the American people are or prove how corrupt our voting system is. I have always been a registered Democrat, but not always voting that way. I decided 2 years ago to vote for Trump if he ran. I am so tired of being lied to by the Democratic party and really tired being lied to by the media. It takes a Australian news show to be truthful. Wake up America...we all know things were so much better when Trump was President. 🎉🎉🎉"
"Hey have built thousands of Manufacturing Warehouse’s in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Indiana.  Those Warehouses are completely EMPTY, NOT open for business….waiting for this election to fill those warehouses with SLAVE LABOR…..wake up America!  China is here and ready to roll out their “non-unión plants!"
"Look what Kamala did to California with all this crime, as attorney General she Was a failure.thats who some of you want running  this country  she will be instructed by Hilary, the legged mack daddy, and oprah"
I worked long hours every day but that dream she is taking about is long because of kamala Biden inflation it is not possible.we need president Trump for  that dream to come true
liar liar pants on fire😂
"SCAMala stated that Trump divided America. No, the Biden/Harris did. She  is single handedly making it worse. She truly tickles me when she says Donald Trump left the country in a economic disasters. She incontestably needs to STOP."
She's got to be the stupidest human I've ever seen or heard......she should be embarrassed....I damn sure won't be voting for her. Other countries are laughing at her!
I run Trump Rallies Car and Truck parades ! The amount of Trump Supports is fantastic !!  TRUMP!
The entire left is a exercise in stupidity!  The world's biggest problem is leftisim
Kamala can’t answer even a simple question .😱
But she will win along with her running mate Don Rickles
Dum dum. And people will vote for her. They can't say why.
I am a woman and I am not not voting for her!!!
"She's going to win, I hate to say it, but I believe that she the perfect person to finish what Biden started. The Dumbness must continue in order to destroy this nation and build a new government."
They had better print more money because our citizens are in trouble and this administration is the cause!
Who will elec5 her. She doesn’t know how.
"Kamala looks down when she is asked a question, shes a huge liar, try looking up, your an idot."
Lier!!!
Wow can she lie
"After the whole $750 while she sends trillions overseas the communist countries. I don’t see her when. I don’t know how those are going to vote, but they are not impressed with her whatsoever. She was passing around money. Those were our funds for disasters like this. If she gets away with this, we will all know it was rigged.  Trump’s cases are dropping because they were not just. This lady knows nothing and she is such a communist to boot."
That woman is out of her mind
Lies
She's not fit to be in any political office....lying about her race is despicable!
Life's a bitch.... Don't elect one. 🙄🤦🏼‍♀️
"Yeah, and raising corporate taxes is exactly the reason why corporations have all fled the country! Sure tax the companys that hire the people who issue the paychecks! Why do the damned left wingers think china is booming? And some other countrys? The tax on businesses should actuall be set at ""0"" and the u.s. would be booming right now! Jobs for everyone, but the taxaholic libtards just cant figure that out."
"She’s a liar, the interviewer is the worse and I’m not a smart woman but I could answer those questions way better than her😮"
She knows how to sided step the truth
"America is running for president with 4 or 5 other people, not just senile biden saying kamala is the democrats voted on pick !"
Pathetic that she was installed by the Dems
"Also Joe biden put forth that 25,000 housing grant, it gets voted down every year for 4 years !"
The only thing unraveling is this stupid YouTube channel and Donald Trump. Way to support insurrectionist traitor rapists! You're a disgrace!
She acts drunk
She lies so much she believes her lies.
Dosent the headline Trainwreck say it all.!😂
She's a liar !
She really is bad at talking she’s faking it(badly) til she tries to make it
Maybe she needs to get into bed with someone to assure the presidency...
America might have the worst president of all if Donald Trumps losses this time and the hardship will be more real this time economically because it seems like the Kamala Harris doesn't have enough experience and confidence in herself she is barely bold enough to answer some questions which are important to the Americans careful guys when voting. I am not American but I can definitely see through some worst mistakes😂😂😂
"She needs  to go back to California ,with the rest of the fruits,nuts, and flakes!"
Presidentette....<br><br>KAMALA PROPOSES TO MAKE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE...<br><br>CROSSING THE MEXICAN BORDER...<br><br>FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN AMERICA..<br><br>CREATE NEW AMERICAN DOLLAR...<br><br>COMBINE THE DOLLAR WITH THE MEXICAN peso...<br><br>CALLED THE AMERICAN peso<br><br>1 million american pesos buys 1 cigar<br>voters promising to vote for kamala<br>receives 1 million american pesos

She always get stuck on one word or another.Funny she needs help
I LOVE Sky News Australia
Please don't vote for Dingbat and Knucklehead!
I’m amazed that Kamala thinks she has the capability to be POTUS. Most people know their limitations. Kamala has no idea of how empty and incompetent she is.
"Claiming shes Black when shes not.. <br>""She was scared and it was showing, we all said Fuck you Bitch and kept going"".."
"She lies through her ass because her mouth knows better,"
Her level of disconnect is frightening. What world does she live in.
She makes me sick!! I pray she doesn’t cheat her way in like Biden did or America is in trouble! TRUMP 2024!!!
"I'm either Democrat or Republican but I can tell you this for a fact. The Democrats are out to wreck this country, the economy, and just absolutely lay waste to this great nation and if by chance and God forbid she does get into office. This everybody will see firsthand😮😢"

Too bad president job is not obtained on sexual means.
Polls are fake psyop bull to make people believe the narrative that this thing is even close. <br>ALL MEDIA ARE OWNED BY THE SAME PEOPLE.<br>What the hell is so hard to understand about that?
"Just get out there and work harder! It's magic, see!"
She is lying 🤥
That’s because she is a moron 😂
I really hate her voice!!! The most stupid woman in America!!!
"Obama: ""I need a VP dumber than me"". - picks Biden<br>Biden: ""I need a VP dumber than me"". - picks Harris<br>Harris: ""I need a VP dumber than me"". - picks Walz<br>I'm seeing a trend here.  The Democratic party kept spiraling into deeper stupidity.<br>Trump / Vance 2024."
"It doesn‘t matter how bad she is, people will still vote for her against Trump!"
"Some how they win, doesn't. Make sense"
"The Orange Buffoon and Boy Blunder are going down in the election, defeated by intelligent adults with plans for America's future. Not going back to the chaos created by the orange toddler in old man's skin.."
She always has knee pads on 😂😂😂
That’s how they fool the normies - they lie monumentally! Soft heads believe them.
We had way more money with Trump.. we are hurting now its unbelievable 🥺💜✝️🕯️🕊️

TRUMP Wins
Trump Vance 2024.
The only hard she know about work is between willie B legs
Holistic new age? Dan
HARRiS HAS PROVED HERSELF TO BE AN OBOMINATION TO AMERICA over the last 4 years.
"I grew up middle class. Our neighbors mowed their lawns. We have ambitions, dreams, and aspirations. I will create an opportunity economy....hollistically i will say it 10 more times."
Omg that msnbc lady should be fired
"Guys that word means ,holes in the entire plan.😂"
Yay! A new filler word 🙄
"sobering up is hard shes trying to quit drinking sense we called her out so much,"
LIES LIES LIES THEY NEVER TIRE OF LYING 😮
She is still winning. Unfortunately too many idiots out there
Anybody understand any of that ????
She's polling ahead in almost every poll.<br>What do you mean?<br><br>The entire premise of this video is entirely dissmissable in one google search? There's dozens of entities that poll americans and almost all show Kamala marketly ahead?
"IF democrats didn't LIE, they'd never speak. TRUMP2024 !!"
Its amazing we have to look outside of the USA for Factual News about harris
How did a law degree
"Thanks br<br>Shame on those who vote for her , may God Save Us"
"She's sneaky she's low vibrational spirit she has no empathy for humanity to be honest a lot of these politician people don't have no empathy for humanity, and for the world. There's no peace and love in this world because many people are asleep spiritually people need to start waking up and start not depending on the matrix but start depending on God love and peace. I shall say that they're still hope for this world but just have faith in God 💚  and trust nobody but God. Project inner love and healing into yourself into the world and the start making positive changes within our community"
"OMG! Please save us President Trump.  MAGA, President Trump 2024 🇺🇸🦅🇺🇸"
She is no joke!!
"After using my brain holisticly, I come to the conclusion that she's the physical embodiment of a brain fart."
Yeah right 😅
The Democrats would vote for the ham sandwich. They're that brainless
"I swear...kamala,  Freeland and Trudeau have the word salad answers down pat. Top shelf liars! Lol😊"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k90LSk70ckU&t=200"">3:20</a>"
"She is a professional whore, what do you expect? She was on her knees to get her to where she is now."
"""Unraveling"" implies that a at some point, she ""had all together,"" which she needed did.  M.L. had the excuse of being young when she..um.. got involved in politics and she GREW UP and changed up her image- eventually.  Kamala is still making her mess."
Koala Harris. lol
"Optimism is not uniquely American.  Optimism is uniquely human. Sheesh!<br><br>How much more of the giggling, waving, and empty phrases can we take?"
I've lost touch with reality and can no longer differentiate between Kamala and SNL skits of her.

"Liar, running for our President? Stop the madness. Trump 2024"
everybody is laughing at her and everybody will be laughing at us if she wins 🤦
"Did I hear her say millionaires. I guess that includes her Obama, Hillary, Pelosi, Oprah, and the rest of them I’d like to see them pay their share . They go after the working people. they can barely afford to buy food for their children. I would challenge her to live on 1200 a month. Let’s see how she would live with that amount. After you pay your rent, you don’t have no money to pay your light bill. You have no money for food and thank God I don’t have a car because I can’t afford a car payment or gas for that car or the taxes and tag. In small towns we don’t have the city bus."
America is not your dildo !!!
It's rigged. Get used to another apoplectic president.
"I cant believe that some people are STUPID ENOUGH TO VOTE FOR someone like her, SAD."
Just say no to Kammunism.
STOP your shameful LYING!
Harris is incompetent …
Kamala has an economic plan...take money from those who earn it and give it to people who didn't earn it.  It is going to be the financial rape of working people.
"Wake up, people! She's a disaster unfolding with a bunch of rich liberal billionaire elitist and liberal media babing her,  so nothing changes. Wake up, people!!! Yes, Trump has personality issues, but you know what he's saying and where he's coming from."
"Everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie! Can she please make a coherent statement just once? These conditions that we live in now didn't exist when Trump was president!!! Does she think the public is dumb? Some are loss, but most are intelligent. Never never answer questions directly. Only the simple-minded will support this nonsense"
"Dream,love, ambitions it's a shame."
"Excellent statement Rita. ""Empty platitudes"""
Why do you think china Russia and Iran want her to win?  Because she will be bulldozed by them
"massively taxing corporations and billionaires is only gonna hurt the little people because they'll just put their prices up. She really hasn't got a clue. You need to drill baby drill. But she's all about no fracking but then they buy the oil from venezuela & saudi arabia. She is just a air head. She is so racist to call herself 'Black'. I don't know why blacks can't see it. If Trump claimed to be 'Black' they'd see it. Why would they continue to enslave themselves again with the democrats. That kind of thinking makes you understand why they chose to be slaves in bygone times. It's like saying ""My thinking cap isn't working"" so ""can i please return to slavery & i'll through in my future off springs as slaves aswell"". It makes me ashamed of black. Profound !"
How did she graduate from law school ???
"Deep down inside, she's an empty vessel with no brain and bullshit in the absence of a real agenda! She and this administration have done  NOTHING for the AMERICAN PEOPLE and EVERYTHING for 20 million ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS!! VOTE TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT!!❤️🇺🇲💪"
“Let’s be inspired to think about being inspired..it’s truly inspiring “ <br>~Kamala “Salad Toss” Harris
If her and waltz are the best they can dich up after crooked Joe the only way they are going to win is steal the election like the last one I would guess.
She is such a DUMB ASS
She doesn’t know what she’s doing
"She's an idiot, holistically!"
"The Dems want her to be president, it's just a bit much for them to also demand she have all her marbles. That would be a bit... hypocritical of them."
a lot similar to wait for it ….. our Alboneasy
she need mental help
It looks like Carmela gets more and more darker in her face or I have something with my eyes?!
You are doing exactly what you say the other team is doing.
Q: What is your plan? Harris: I grew up in a middle class family. Trump: I will lower energy costs by 50% in 12 months. No comparison!!!
😂😂😂<br>Tf? Stop making sh*t up!!!!
There is no way she is close to tump number they are lying because they are going to install her no matter what. She is gonna be president. They will cheat and we need to be ready to fight
She has nothing that makes a U.S presidential candidate
Kamala Harris talks more like rat salad from Black Sabbath than word salad.
She A Clown 🤡🤡🤡
"First it was Joe Biden scaring the hell out of everybody feeling like we've just been invaded by another planet when that guy became president with the mask on the black mask and 26,000 National Guard soldiers with M60 machine guns around the Capitol building with razor wire talk about intimidating now somehow Kamala Harris is the president now and now we get to be terrified by Kamala Harris that she's going to cut our testicles off and put them in our mouth and torture us at the same time so we've been tortured by Joe Biden for 3 years now we're being tortured by Kamala Harris Fear Factor up the bunghole make us so petrified of our own shadow now that Kamala Harris is in control of everything and everybody it's like man I should just run right in front of a speeding train cringe isn't the word I don't know what the word is or the feeling but it's not good"
Welcome to fantasy island 🏝
You gotten to be a special kinda stupid to want 4 more years of this hell
Camela is DISGUSTING!!!!! She is NOT a leader!
She lies. The jobs were thriving before the pandemic. Your administration took credit for the jobs that came back.
What is sad so many still want her here no matter what she does.
God is she stupid?
Watch for her nose flare; her being vice President. That's right boys and girls she's already in the office and what has she done for us the past couple of years
The 'facts' are harris and the dems are lying communist pigs.
That bimbo
It's frightening that out of the millions & millions in the US these are the best  they come up with ffs😢
"I think the only people voting for her will be 2 groups:  there are women who plan to vote for her simply because she is a woman,  the second group will vote against Trump.  Not because they like her, but because they hate Trump.   <br>I can't fathom any other reason to vote for her. There are young women who will vote for anyone who will allow them to play around with reproduction, rather than taking the ability to reproduce as a sacred opportunity.  I heard one such young female   (NOT A LADY!) say how glad she was that she had been able to have that little life ripped from her body limb by limb.  She kept saying how she loved doing that.  I almost threw up listening to such evil come out of her mouth."
"F*ck Kamala, F*ck Biden, this election year 2024 I never voted before but I don't like any of the sh*t that has been happening in the U.S. so I'm registered to vote and I'm voting for Trump"
Why is Sky News Media so much better than our (USA) media??
Think Wisely America <br>THIS IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT <br>I VOTED FOR AT ALL A JUSE IS ALLOWED Biden A GO AHEAD WITH <br>STUDENT LOAN That's A FLUSH TO<br>HURRICANE DEAD VICTIMS ARE LYING AROUND NOT GOOD REMEMBER MAUI NOW WHERE IS THAT MONEY COMING FROM FOR STUDENT LOAN'S 🤔 PRAYER'S TO <br>HURRICANE VICTIMS RIP🙏😇🙏<br><br>🚨VOTE WISELY AMERICA 🚨
megyn kelly looks like a man !
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k90LSk70ckU&t=582"">9:42</a> she speaks exactly how I used to write my papers in college when I needed to fill the word count 😂😂"
"I am in shock that the Democrats think that K.Harris is their best example of an educated strong woman to be the leader of our nation. She is not aware that the majority of us are hard working, responsible people."
Taxing the hardworking is the end of their game with that evil party.
"That Kamala is a train wreck is an understatement. We are involved with two wars, we have a major port strike, high inflation, millions of unvetted people in the country, high prices on food, fuel, etc. and she done nothing about any of this.  <br>The one city and state she represented is a train wreck.  Highest taxes in the nations. People sleeping on the streets. Shit and needles all over the streets of SF. Businesses pulling out. Crime in all cities, but especially in SF out of control.  She has done nothing to advance her positions<br>She would be a disaster for this country."
Most public policy involves getting people to work and start paying taxes to share the load of living in a democracy.   Harris is a liar.
Idk if this Moron no's  that when you buy a house and you are a first time buyer 6mon to a year later you sell your house and buy another you are now a first time buy so this 25kfor  is going to bankrupt the country I no iam on my 3rd house and getting ready to buy my 4th in Feb and the way that you is you don't pay taxes which I have never had to pay
She is pure evil
She’s just crazy
Kamala loves that philosophical horse crap !!! That's why her answers turn into wordsalad nonsense
"She talks and talks and when she shuts up, I don’t know what she just said except “where we have been” what is that??????"
THEY KNOW THEY CAN LIE THEIR WAY INTO OFFICE WITH THE MEDIA HELPING THEM!
"Kamala and Trump are not capable of running this country. Truth is they actually don't. Kamala is certainly the lesser intelligent and educated to be the mouthpiece. Trump isn't much brighter. Again, they are just talking heads for a much bigger power."
She's only capable of being the president of the imbecile Club
LAIR Lair that is all she nos
Ooooo big words
BIDEN said WE CANNOT BE TRUSTED!! Vote ❤❤❤ TRUMP/ VANCE 2024❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Don't know why the most unpopular VP in history would win.
why do we care about what Australians think about American Politics?
Save DEMOCRACY and AMERICA from EVIL ONES!  ❤❤❤ TRUMP/VANCE 2024❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That's cause she's a fraud
I hate to watch her.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤. TRUMP/VANCE 2024❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"Ok so foreigners don't care for, and wouldn't vote for Kamala, but is America stupid enough to elect her? They were dumb enough to elect Biden"
How is those esr buds working for ya Kamala <br>Cheater!!!!!!!
"KAM 'ALA' THE HECKLER AND JIGGLIER. SHE SOUNDS LIKE THE ""JOKER"". HER INSANE LAUGHTER IS DIRECTED AT THE AMERICAN PATRIOTS! SHE'S AN IDIOT JUST LIKE JOE! SHE'S HAS NO ECONOMIC POLICIES PERIOD!👎👎👹👹"
Has anyone elese noticed she is completely  clueless.
Marxits witch stupid as the day is long
They should show her how she doesn't answers the questions and then Americans Peoples won't be fool by her. She's been Vice President for three years and didn't do nothing that's her records not very good records.
Im inspired to 🤮.
Her plan sucks!
It’s dry heaving!
I didn’t know you could catch Dementia of someone else because it looks like she’s caught it off crooked Joe
"She didn’t win the elections fair and Square. She didn’t do anything, but she just took over Biden‘s people. She didn’t have any delegates. This is one woman I do not want as my first woman president. I am a woman and I want to be proud to have a smart woman in the White House, and she’s just a little giggling girl"
Thank you for sharing that That's awesome
"""A train wreck,"" you say ?<br>Id say ,more like a <br>""train wrecker""!"
"Hey Youtube Censors.  Time for you to re-calibrate to the truth, Kamala Harris is a worthless turd.  stop trying to hide the truth you worthless stupid Fucker Youtube Censors."
I mean...maybe...but she's not a rapist which makes her the only option 🤷‍♂️
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k90LSk70ckU&t=44"">0:44</a> bit hypocritical saying she is getting a ""free run"" when the only thing sky news australia posts about are critical against the left???"
Great she wants to raise gas prices food housing which is now in New York going up as I type
Ich hasse ihr ständiges lachen
She's Just a holistic person lol 😅😊
LMAO WHAT A DISASTER!!!! FREAKING CIRCUS CLOWN HARRIS.
I holistically know that if Kamala wins she will destroy America!
"On housing,  Kamilian Harris, eyes just crushed, I can see her brain having a short circuit. To much ignorance concentrated in one brain."
"If you really want honest news we have to go out of our own country,these people are real reporters!!!!!"
You can't leave the person in charge of the problem that created the  problem  in the first place! TRUMP 2024!!!
Wants us all to be hard working s9 we can get taxed into oblivion!!!!!!
Just goes to show how uninformed the liberal pukes really are!!!!!
"Whats the point of having dreams when she doesn't know how to stop lying, Trump 2024  she can't manage the border and no good plan to grow the economy"
It's a FACT that que-mala is where she is due to special favors that started with Mr. BROWN in California.  As a woman I'm simply DISGUSTED BY HER & EVERYTHING SHE REPRESENTS.
She never had a honeymoon  with America.  It's been a FAKE narrative by msm playing cover for the political joke the American CITIZENS NEVER VOTED FOR !!!!!!!!!!!
Kamala is a Scam!!!
CAN You imagine this  word salad BS for 4 more years!!! Please vote Trump / Vance 2024!!!❤❤❤
"If she doesn't know the facts, she's telling you what's she supposed to tell you, because somebody told her to say it, because they don't like Trump, and I can tell you who Pelosi and chuck Schumer."
Corrupt communist
"😂🎉 and she's a dummy, you just don't know how to talk about this country or anything? This shows how stupid she really is. And she can't be a President."
Since the “other” relief flights are all connected to Catholic and other Christian religions Kamala is against them even if it results in hardship and/or deaths!
Please let us be unburdened by what has been .....which has been a F'n nightmare <br>the last 4 years ...... If more than half the American people can't stand Kamala Harris <br>Just imagine what World leaders might think of her....
Lol  😂   Hahaha  🤣 🤣🤣🤣
That’s a lie The Economy was booming with Trump there were Jobs. Kamala needs to answer a question and have a solution to solve the problems that she helped create with Biden administration. She has no plan on how to do any of this.
Imagine covering other countries politics
"Democrats are UNSUITABLE for giving orders, they should TAKE ORDERS (As in ""Do you want fries with that, sir?"")"
It sounds like Kamala's holistic aspiration needs some inspiration...
Her stupidity has no bounds.
"The biggest thing people can do before they vote is compare Trump and Harris and the job they have done. Kamala has completely destroyed the country claiming she will make everything better yet forgets to recognize she's the one that has caused the problems. She has allowed 425,431 unvetted illegals to freely roam the country with murder convictions,  sexual assault convictions, rape convictions, robbery convictions and assault convictions. She has also allowed 222,141 unvetted illegals to freely roam the country with pending murder charges,  pending sexual assault charges, pending rape charges,  pending robbery charges and pending assault charges. Plus 2,000,000 get aways. She signed the Inflation Reduction Act  that had nothing to do with reducing inflation and caused exorbitant inflation,  and attached to the bill was to give billions of tax payers dollars to other countries. She signed the Green New Deal which is also part of the cause of inflation as well, and again attached in that bill was to give other countries billions of taxpayers' dollars. She ripped up the sanctions Trump had on Iran in which they handed over 16 billion in taxpayers dollars which allowed them to buy ballistic missiles. When Trump was in office we had one of the most secured borders, our cost of living was tremendously lower and we had mo wars gping on. To me, it's very clear which candidate is better for the American citizens. Donald J. TRUMP."
We have complete dumbassed running this country.
How is she going to raise the money? Ask Zelensky to help you out LOL you sent him billions so his wife could spend money on expensive spending sprees and cocaine for him 🤣 maybe he's got some money left over 🤣🤣🤣
CAN'T EVEN ANSWER A QUESTION AND THE LIES TOO BOOT
"It's weird seeing a negative news report about her, which is kinda sad."
"""UHH... BUH-BUH-BUH....."" As King Carlos would say, WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP!"
Kamala better do research herself! Because she has no help she fired or the help chose to quit ! She is disgusting! Not any type of qualities for any White House position!im sure billionaires pay taxes already! She is so mindless! Let’s look at her income and her Trust fund in China ??
Never thought I’d ever see anything close to Michael Dukakis or Jimmy Carter.  Glad Carter was able to outlive his Presidential mealy mouthing whatever subject but he (they) contributed to the foolishness!
Kamala better do research herself! Because she has no help she fired or the help chose to quit ! She is disgusting! Not any type of qualities for any White House position!
she never gives answers only word salads but when she  does she LIES BIG TIME! Isn't she embarrassed? Anyone can see she lies and lies and lies! She should hide under a rock and never come out again!
Wow she has no chance in hell
Oh here we go again another Word Salad😢
Thank you for sharing this treasonous witch!
"Only short-sighted idiots refuse to understand that business taxes are a cost of doing business, and are passed on to the consumer."
She has always been a trainwreck
What a big dummy
PLEASE cut the background elevator music. it's annoying and distracting.
"IS THAT ALL VOMIT WITH NO WRETCH, O! M! G! I HAVEN'T LAUGHED SO HARD N MONTHS TY!!! OMG"
"They could have pick  really everyone else. Anyone is better then biden, but no, they choose Kamala that is worse 😅😅😅😅"
KAMALA’s HUSBAND IS JEWISH!!! SHE STANDS WITH ISREAL AND SO DOES TRUMP!
She is in the White House already lady🤣
Im inspired to vote for Trump ❤!!!
"Can you imagine her sitting down and talking with Putin? <br>And tell me why she keeps blaming everything on Trump when shes the one in office, and has been for the past 3.5 yrs. What an absolute train wreck! Democrats have caused the mess <br>we're in now."
"And then when she's talking about raising corporate taxes and making sure that the ""billionaires"" pay their fair share....... There they go again being so eat up with Donald Trump and being jealous of the fact that he's worth more money than they are and he didn't cheat to get any of it that they just can't stand it so that's all they can think about!!!!!!!!!"
We all know she's incompetent but she'll win by hook or by crook.
"kamela, MAY be ""unraveling', BUT you would NEVER know this if your only source of 'news' was from the Communist Party's ""Ministry of Truth"", and the adoring, drooling, unquestioning, propagandists of the American MEDIA.<br><br>Thankfully Sky News Australia provides an accurate, objective look at American politics, and the consequences that WILL occur should the Communists and their 'soiled doves' in  the MEDIA STEAL the election, as they did in 2020."
Look at evil Hillary with Kamala Disgusting Deep State Illuminati Blood Sucking Vampires
Just a jack ass
"Kamala Harris is just A STUPID LIAR!!  You can't fix STUPID Harris!!  The democrats have been selling out American starting with OBAMA!!!  Obama is in his THIRD TERM and DOES NOT need HIS FOURTH TERM through the microphone in Harris's ear like he did Biden's!!  The best shape the OUR county has in was when TRUMP WAS and WILL BE President!!!  Harris has NOT done ONE thing during her VP, so WHY would she be a president when she is A LAZY ASS getting paide to do ABSOLUTLY NOTHING!!  When she said ""will just HAVE to raise taxes, sounds to me a little like CHINA!!"
Kamala es mentirosa de nacimiento.😮😮
She sounds like she is high as a kite
"I wish that in America, all of our media companies weren’t gotten paid for by the same people who spew this nonsense"
The Biden administration is the problem
"Sadly it doesn't matter that she's a lying, whoring, unqualified, diversity hire that used her purple bacon to make it to the white house she's easy to control and the powers that be don't want a leader they want a puppet so unfortunately she's gonna probably gonna ""win"""
2020 was stolen by the democrats!  Stolen!!
Whoever supports Harris something wrong with your brain cells.  So brainwashed. They mush not love our country if you vote Harris.
"Clearly, Kamala has no idea what she's doing. She is NOT qualified for the presidency."
SKY NEWS.... I WILL LIKE TO SAY AMAZING JOB!!!! LOVE YOUR NEWS TEAM. MUCH LOVE FROM THE USA!!! 🇺🇸
Don’t understand why democrats thought a mentally impaired Kamala could beat Trump and  a mentally impaired Joe couldn’t
"She always say the same speech . Kamala has no policies, she has no plan. Her plan id draining the middle-class people. We are sick of Kamala."
She needs to go back to California and retire like Obama that is from Illinois and lives on the east coast cause he knows it is shit show 🎯💯💥👊🏻🇺🇸
Far worse than Joe and Gwen is a sinker!
australian reporting is ridiculous
Thank you SKY NEWS AUSTRALIA!!<br>Santa Barbara California Loves Loves Loves you !!!!!<br>Phuc you KONMALA and all who supports her!! God danm you all
This interviewer is in bed with harris and the Communists libturds
Kamala has visions that are communistic
About time!
Thanks form Houston Texas for covering this
She needs to buy the App ChatGPT 😂😂
Must have been his senility that led Biden into choosing her for VP in the first place.
She’s so phony
Learn how to say her name. Don’t you have anything interesting going on in AU?
"I hole istic lee think holistically she is , the holistic lady of holistisity."
"What a surprise that the person no one voted for when she did run for president, and no one considered for VP until she was a last minute pick by Biden, is a very poor choice for the presidency. Despite being puffed up by media."
Candence Owens made a nice research on her white/hindu family
SHE KNOWS NO FACTS! ALL SHE KNOWS IS HOW TO LIE LIKE A DIRTY DOG!
I'm from CT US and go to sky news for at least 70% of my news !!!!
"It will be a mercy to Harris to lose the election. If she wins, she will endure 4-years of relentless public exposure and humiliation. No one enjoys being a fool, especially as the first ""black"", female American president. Her disastrous example would be a tragedy for the progress of women everywhere in the public square."
Here's one thing that is not being said.<br>IF she raises taxes on the large corporations and billionaires.<br>Their taxes hikes will trickle down to higher prices on everything <br>The middle class will have to pay for everything. And that is FACT
Yeah we're going to vote for Trump can't handle four more years of what we got none of us will be alive
“May the odds always be in your favor”
The real question will Libs wake up and see this COMMIE for what she is an America Hater.
She always interviews like she's just smoked a blunt.
You raise taxes we go to poverty the people will go to Poverty If they raise any more taxes at this point in time
Why are they not held to a higher standard of behavior. If you blantantly cannot tell accurately rhen you shpuld be removed or charged. <br>Make an oath like in court. This is getting absurd.
There's no tie!!!  Trump actually is up by +20 across the board.<br>🇺🇲Trump🇺🇲 2024
"I think President Obama is who would be really running the country with her face because he cant do the job legally.  She has NO IDEA how to run this country. How could she, she cant even answer a simple question."
I can’t wait to see her reaction when she loses the election to Trump it’s going to be Hillary all over again
Fake news
Kramallah is truly an idiot
Your visa
"Kamala is the biggest liar and a corrupt politician, the worst is that the democrat even willing to commit treason to win the election.....totally dispicable, I hope all American can see that<br><br>God bless America ❤️........from Malaysia"
More bull shit from the Trumpies.  Only now with an Aussie accent.  Trump is going down the toilet and his suck up fascist wannabes know it.  😂
Sky news😲😲..you do good honest reporting..thought the elite bought you too...<br>Thank you i must say..show the real news..
That's bad when the lie factory CNN calls you put.
Oprah needs to be cancelled also
JILL STEIN 2024 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
"They will lie to get her elected like they did for biden even tho I cannot find one person that wants her and most of the comments I read even back when biden was running nobody wanted them. <br>I drove half way cross pa and didn’t see one biden sign besides 3 miles from my house rest all trump and he was winning when I went bed and somehow woke up n he biden won Pennsylvania,ya right thieves."
"Check out that $60,000 necklace she's been wearing. She went to the border wearing it."
shes high asf
They had 4 years to find a qualified candidate but we're to busy stealing from American tax payers and corruption
"The most terrible type of salad on the world is WORD SALAD! Kamala's word salad: ""Holistically""."
Dumb as a box of rocks do not let her lead this country
She's always waving her hands around becaue she needs some kind of sign language to make up for her inability to express coherent thought.
"Lies, lies, lies all based on lies, the Abortion issue is so false, anyone who lives in the ghettos & barrios,illegals since 1970’s could go to the clinics proved by Planned Parenthood’s murder factory and minority women were ENCOURAGED to have free abortions (1st hand knowledge) Trump is against a Plan Parenthood quest to rid America’s to stop minorities from ever being born, this is what Kamala supports, huge $$$$$ involved corruption all these years."
She has nothing to offer she can do nothing but lye.
Kalamama's eye's glaze over when she tries to think of something smart to say but she tries too hard to sound like Obamama but she's not intelligent enough to hide it and pull it off she also  has a little Bill Cosby she trows in for personality.
The illusion of choice.
"Only huge money can make her look half decent, half human. Black women in her circle have been verbally abused and fired just for not handing her the “r favorite pen” to sign."
The bad thing is that so many believe in her nothingness.  Such fools followers of a Pied Pipper. I feel sorry for them.
Absolute liar...no lost manufacturing jobs.
Flibertyjibbit.
Please show this to the world!
Holistic equalistic nice
Terrible person to be president
I can’t afford to live in a dream.
I'll take Kamala over Dumb Trump any day.
"She doesn't control Blackrock , vanguard, or largest corporations."
"She's nothing but a<br> hollow husk, old bag of lies...."
The term is word soup! SOUP not salad
I am so inspired to vote for Trump. How’s that for being inspired 😅
She truly makes Americans look stupid
Harris is the worst ever. My dogs are smarter
"Absolutely not qualified to run anything, what a disaster."
"Too many leftists don't care. We have an ""I want"" society. They want federal abortion rights. They don't care about the country. Socialism sounds great as long as they get free money, health care,  etc."
SHE HAS TURNED BACK ON HELPLESS FROM HURRICANE..SHE REFUSED HELP NO MONEY IN FEMA
"<b>THE INTERVIEWER'S CLOTHING AND HAIR STYLE, PRESENTS HER AS A VERY LOW ON THE PECKING ROW, OF THE SUBBASEMENT CHAMBERS</b>"
Shameful!
How can pple vote for her .she buys votes
Only one word...Pathetic. <br>Even when Helene is leaving havoc all true the US. She's out campaigning and Biden is at the beach side...<br>Donald Trump is visiting the regions that took a hit. He is the only one that does what presidents do.<br>I can't see another 5 minutes more....
Artificial intelligence for president!
Just answer the question!!! Please !! That’s it.    Unreal
Absolutely clueless and stupid!
Stupid coruption oozes from her.full demons
"😢, "" + PRAISE AND GLORY ONLY TO LORD, JESUS CHRIST.!AMEN. HALLELUJAH.!""<br><br>This Woman (Harris), totally  did somethings(substance).,<br>No thought.! Citizens  we are not ""dumb millioans.!"""
"KADINI HEMEN İNFAZ ETMEYE BAŞLADINIZ!  OBAMA’DAN BUŞH’DAN, TRUMP’DAN DAHA KUVVETLİ VİCDANI VE ÖN SEZİSİ VAR! SEÇMEN DEĞİLİM AMA, AMERİKAYA DAHA GÜVENİLİR BİR İMAJ GETİRİR DİYE DÜŞÜNÜYORUM! 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷"
Hag.she wont help americans.she knows no truth.she is a witch
Wait for the LIE after she says “ this is what I know and the facts” <br>What a stupid brainless cow
Rem pple the hurricane .she wont help no one.pple dieing no help for them suffering
"Over the significant passage of time, I have been holistically inspired to be unburdened by what has been so that the thing that can be could happen in a holistic manner. Don't you agree? Asking for a neighbor who loves his lawn, holistically speaking of coarse!!<br>🇺🇸Trump 2024🇺🇲"
We don't like Kamala.... LITERALLY at this point she's embarrassing herself we see what she did with the border 🙄 soooo Yeah 👎
shaking her head no the entire time.... she doesn't even buy it herself. lol
"Yeh she has ambition, and aspirations... TO BRING DOWN THE COUNTRY FROM WITHIN."
"Lies, lies and more holistic lies 🤥🤥🤥"
"She's basically just bluffed her way to the top, but people can now see right through it, like a window!!"
Sky news is for trump😅
"The scary thing is no matter how bad she does in interviews or on stage giving incoherent speeches, there are still a large amount of people who would still vote for her because they either hate Donald Trump or they like she's brown and female."
"Shaking of the head ""no"" while answering is a subliminal message."
"She can't do the job and the sooner she faces that the better off she'll be, so eat that Obama."
She 😅😅is a LIAR !!!
Kamala is like a teenager trying to hit a word count but didn't do the work nor read the subject matter.
"Poor Democrats have only one choice! This Kamala disaster! Even a brain dead Biden is better than this pathetic, wanna be dictator! This race is over and America’s looking at a Trump Vance landslide victory!"
The only thing shes qualified for is swallowing  a hot load.
Shut up Kamala please!!😂
Weird! Merriam-Webster-Webster just “updated” the definition of holistic on 9/22/24. 😂<br>I had never heard that word used like that until Kamala did it.
She is done
She's just imitating Trump.
The media is controlled by the Democrats it would not surprise me if they're being paid off by the Democratic Party
What a liar complete liar Lowlife our country is turning into a train wreck Trump all the way
HOASSHARRIS 👎 👎
WE AINT GOT A G G GOOD BRAIN.....
We need to be unburdened by what has been. 😖
"So many Demoncrats hate trump, and believe all the bogus charges against him, the will vote for someone who has no clue/qualifications on being president!"
This is the sign of the devil saying this 3 X just like 66+
"Inspire us, let inspire, inspire, inspire........ ? What was the question 🤔"
"Don’t worry, they will cheat again like they did with Joe Biden in 2020. Joe Biden was just as bad as her or worse. It doesn’t matter how many people vote for Donald Trump, the deep state government and the leftist Democrat Marxist will use the mail in votes, dead people votes, whatever it takes. The United States is doomed."
Kamala is a freeloader  Indian entitled Snowflake her father is a Professor shes not working class.
Once again thank you so much for supporting the United States you guys are awesome! We don’t have to ask Kamala Harris what her policies on the border the economy foreign policies are     She has shown us over the last 3 1/2 years what she supports! <br>She has proven to be nothing but a monumental liar and the United States will suffer even more under her presidency! I have to say that the thought of that is the most terrifying thing I can imagine! 🤮🤬
She does not have any good answers !!!  She lies and lies !!! Please wake up !!!! <br> Thank you for reporting the truth !!! 🇺🇸✝️🙏🦅 Trump/Vance 24
She does not have any good answers !!!  She lies and lies !!! Please wake up !!!! <br> Thank you for reporting the truth !!! 🇺🇸✝️🙏🦅 Trump/Vance 24
"Sadly, a large number of Harris supporters can name multiple Taylor Swift songs, but can't tell you a single idea or policy Kamala has to offer. They just simply support who they have been told to support and have no clue why."
"What are her real policies?<br>First time homebuyers <br>What about the people that lost their houses and homes because of Covid when they took Office? <br>They cannot afford to get into another home so they are destined to live in an apartment <br>And rents are outrageous home buying is out of control <br>Yet you forget about the people  that lost everything under you and Biden<br>Tax deduction for newborn babies but lower deduction for parents with children. Our veterans live on the street VA helps as much as they possibly can.<br>She don’t care about the war they’re making money off of it<br>They can send billions over to help other countries, but not this country<br>What a shame<br>Illegals and migrants get more and don’t do nothing for it and yet you’re out there busting your butt trying to make a living trying to eat trying to live trying to put a roof over your head and she’s doing nothing for us<br><br>God help America we need you more now than we ever did"
She is such a LIAR! I hate liars! 😠 😡
Trump pull us through covid with stimulus checks.karmala only helps Ukraine an immigration to forgot about us American
"Harris has always been considered one of the most unlikable, disliked people in politics. Even her party members and employees loathe her. One campaign employee recently quit and came forward with just how Kamala treats everyone. The female employee said unless you are an extremely high dollar donor, Kamaly will not even speak to you. She further said that Kamala has frequent staged appearances for the cameras and for show only."
Lie's from Harris
"Anyone who did not know Whore Harris is a complete MORON is also a complete MORON. Fortunately, for Whore Harris dumicrap voters vote for dumicrap politicians because they are dumicraps."
You keep using that word……. I don’t think you know what it means!
Did someone whack her in the head with a frying pan. She has nothing useful to say. Everything seems to be a joke to her. Another bubble head to try and run the country
That women  😂😂😂 worse vice presidential  candidate  ever
Trump 2024
"Cnn keep telling the truth like that CNN I might start listening. Thanks for Correcting Miss, information.well done ✔️"
Ya your dreaming 😂
liar kamala!!
"it's the same with her running mate Tim Waltz, he dont know what he is talking about!"
You can from her tone how emotionally unstable and frustrated she is
Harris is looking ahead to the mansion in Martha’s vineyard next to obamas she don’t know crap about being President
She is not qualified to be president of the United States
Harris lies ever time she speaks so she would be well of to shut up
I can't stop laughing!! I really can't!! <br>And the dribble she sprouts isn't even true!! Baaahahahahaha!!
She makes it up as she goes!
Kamala Harris is a vacuous mess and I despise every single person that supports her.
Kamala was never wound tight with real ideas to start with. The idea that anyone would vote for her is perverse at best.
She is holistic not a good candidate. Making US laughing stock of the world. She makes no sense.
Not the brightest match in the box . Surely the US has more educated people than this gibberish!
Deep state knows she won't win. As we speak? The world is at war. This is all a massive distraction
"WTF,  ?!?!"
As bad as kamala is worse than joe people will still vote for her cause shes a fake black women and cause they hate trump unbelievable. And this are the people complaining on how bad the economy is that they are leaving california.
We All know she has the ear piece in.  Same same same 😢
As my grandmother used to ask my grandfather when he upset her...When was the last time you had a 2 x 4 🪵 across you're knees...Pretty much sums up the state of Affairs in the U.S...Oh well...Boa Sorte from Portugal...🇵🇹👌😎👊
If you the people don’t like Kamala for president then just don’t like her for president. <br>Don’t dislike her because of people like this news anchor and Candace Owens. <br>These people are purposely fighting against her simply because they are for Donald Trump. <br><br>And it is very normal to slander the opposition party in politics whether truth or lies
"People aren't voting for Kamala just because of her color.  The other guy cratered the stock market, saw 1M needlessly die from disease, ballooned the trade deficit with China, completely abdicated on gun violence and climate change, and then led an armed coup against his own citizens."
😈
Stupid people will still vote for her!
“Holistically Inspired” 😂🤣
BS vote blue anyone is better than Trump
At least dopey Joe had dementia to blame what’s her excuse?
"She is so dumb it stinks to Heaven only really Idiots would fall for her, in the Bin and close the Lid quality"
"I would not let her clean my Toilet what a <a href=""http://s.um/"">s.um</a> bag calling her stubit would just  upgrade her . looking at her makes me  feel sick"
Like I say to people i understand why you don't like Trump but how on earth you can vote for these 2 useless Clints is beyond me 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
TRUMP🇺🇸❤️👍
Kabala Harris will take your money and give it to others😮
She and Joey got us trillions more dollars in DEBT!!! 21 MILLION ILLEGALS HELPED THEY MADE US SPEND FOR THAT TRAVESTY
❤❤Lets Welcome Our Former and Future President Donald J Trump and Our Beautiful First Lady Melania Back ❤️🌷❤️🌷❤️
THE ULTIMATE SOCK PUPPET FOR THE EVIL BLUE DEEP STATE WHO WANT ANOTHER 4 YEARS FOR THE OBAMA CABAL AND THE GOAL......AMERIZUELA FOR OUR NATION
I'm not voting for that Witch! She always sidesteps and avoid direct questions and answers irrelevantly. <br>She's mentally incompetent of leading the USA.
So full of 💩!
Kamala = Marxist.
One of Diddy's best friends.
Trump is a successful businessman <br>Kamala has a vagina
When 350 million choose this …..<br>Well it’s clear the world will end soon <br>I’m stunned at the stupidity listening to the nonsense comes out her mouth . <br>Truly dumbfounding.
"Love your channel, thank you for bringing honesty to us. Fox is the only honest network we have in America ❤."
OMG PRESIDENT???
I love you all in Sky News!! Thank you from the USA. 💕
When you're holistically retarded it still makes you a retard
"35 trillion dollars. Where did it go? Haitians, illegal immigrants, hotel rooms 50k in debit cards, that's where it's going."
If you vote for her you hate america
Well you asked who could be a bigger retard than Joe Biden and here she is
WE ARE NOT VOTING ON HIGHSCHOOL PROM COURT. THIS ISN'T A FEELING CONTEST. PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLDS LIVES DEPENDING ON THIS.
"That is Kamala in a nutshell, glad to tell you what she will do but no explanation on how she will do it."
The “press” are bending over backwards as they creep in the slime in their swamp
Im inspired to VOTE TRUMP THANKS
🎧🎭⚠️ ‘Ms. ‘Camela’ 🐪🐫 !!!👅🤪
"Wait until she unleashes on this strike!If you are an illegal you are in her plan but not for the real American.,Biden did not create but cut thousands!!"
Kamaller:)
Let kamala be kamala and her true colors will come out
How they have those  number?  Because a lot of us no answer any question about this.
?
If her hands was tied to her sides. She could not talk. Reminds me of a kindergarten teacher over animated hand gestures.
Great reaction from Oprah. Bewildered and lost with what she said.
If Kamala did interviews topless. Her ratings could improve but I'd still vote Trump!
"Apparently she thinks big words makes her look intelligent, wrong."
If winning the presidential election consisted of a dick sucking contest she would win without any real competition
"If taxes are raised for large companies, they will increase the costs of what they produce. The millionaires are the owners of the companies. The rest of the citizens are affected."
"Her head is shaking ""NO"" the whole time she is talking!😮"
"Miss Kelly be  HOLISTIC inspiration  ,question the that  idea work????"
"IF KAMALA has to been found to have a brain,it was borrowed,no way that woman can run AMERICA,she don't even know what color she is,don't even ask her,she'll lie"
"It doesn't matter how stupid she speaks, how bad her policies are, or how corrupt she is, the Left will vote for her because they hate Trump.  They would rather see our country fail before they vote for him.   They're voting 100% on feelings and not on policies,  track record, etc.  Our county was strong and resource independent under Trump...look at us now.   And these people will vote for 4 more years of this failed administration because they believe the garbage and lies from the left-winged media."
Is this really the best your country has to offer ?. What happened to the the America the world looked up to ? It's lost  to Hollywood standards....everyone is an  expert based  on their bank account/ or their  designer clothing.
the queen devil of evils and lies evil and lies evil and lies
she's the queen devil of evil and lies evil and lies and that's all there is to it and Facebook is for her because they block everything I put on there
Harris should never have been allowed to run for her local golf club.
She would be better to give up her ambition like Biden than to create an embarrassing firestorm into the World American leadership.
❤Trump❤ Vance❤2024❤
she keeps repeating her garbage on mic and video.

TAYLOR SWIFT IS NOT A PSYOP
"RED FLAGS REASONS FOR NOT DATING OR MARRYING WESTERN WOMAN.<br>What are the red flags a lot of WESTERN women display:<br>  1. Call herself a boss b@tch, a bad twitch, they are good for hit and run, pump and dump, and anyone who has one of them in a serious relationship needs to seek help. especially if they think about marrying them, You need to take a good look at yourself, man, if you find them okay,  DO NOT MARRY THEM, I DON'T CARE WHO THEY ARE OR WHAT THEY DO. YOU DON'T WIFE THEM. IN THE LONG RUN, THEY WILL BREAK YOU AND DESTROY EVERYTHING YOU BUILD UP, DON'T DO IT. AND REMEMBER THE STD'S.<br>  2. Always asking you to spend money on her, I mean expensive items, dinner, etc, and not willing to split the cost with you, willing to spend your money without any second thoughts.<br>  3. Men friends, he only a friend, if you fall for that, I have beachfront property on the sun, if you're not the only man in her life, outside of her father, (family) she is gonna have a side piece,  too many men are out there raising kids that is not theirs, over 30% of married men are raising a kid that they don't know that it is not his, remember that over 30%, and once you find out it's late,  and she is gone with over have of your possessions and the kids. and she not gonna give a dam. <br>  4. High body count, They will lie about it, or they don't see anything wrong with it, Most women don't grow out of this, and most will miss it, When she getting down with you she may have so many guys she is thinking about when she with you, no matter what you do, there is gonna be someone that it reminds her of. that doesn't make you special, you're just one of many.<br>  5. If you have any standards, they will say you are controlling, <br>  6. she a feminist,  run away, and she sees you as someone to dominate use, and abuse.<br>  7. If she is from the streets, if a woman that you just met, offers to sleep with you, believe me, you're not the first one or the last one she wants to do this to.  So hit it, but don't fall in love with it, it's not worth it. and could have STD, SO THINK ABOUT IF IT is WORTH THE CHANCE YOU're TAKING.<br>  8. She was not raised by a father<br>  9. Her mother is the type that thinks that a woman doesn't need a man.<br>  10. She has a degree, that will automatically make her think that she <br>is superior to you, and will throw that at you, she will use it against you. and her friends will always cut you down, telling her she deserves better.<br>  11. She makes more than you, your money is her money and her money is her money. you know the rest.<br>  12. She hides her phone, or has a second phone, and doesn't let you access it. always hiding things, and not open about her activities. <br>  13. She has kids, kids with different fathers, she will let you be the supplier of material things for the kids but not be able to input what the kids are taught, and how they are disciplined. you will have no rights over the kids. But if the woman is a widow who has kids, and the husband died of natural causes, except in a street fight with his gang friends. be very careful, the law is against you, the mother can and will make you pay support to the kids if you get too involved with them, so beware, the kid is not yours, and you most likely not be recognized or get the respect the kids love. they are to be taken on a case-by-case basis.<br>  14. She doesn't take care of herself, she is lazy<br>  15. She doesn't cook. or clean the home you are living in. You're working and she's not but expects you to clean and cook when you get home from work, and to take care of your every need when you get home from work. <br>  16. She doesn't respect you, or treat you like a man who needs to be treated, she sees you as someone to take advantage of until someone she thinks is better than you Come along, you are just someone she is using until she accomplishes her main goal.<br>  17. She is a liar if you can't trust anything she says. if she lies once, she most likely has lied to you before and will continue to lie to you, once trust is lost, it can never be totally regained.<br>  18. She dresses like she is showing off her assets for all men to see, even if you have been with her for a long time.<br>  19. You work with her, this is dangerous, if you meet someone at work, one of you must leave, because if things don't work out between you and her, she can make the job a living hell for you and get you fired. <br>  20. body weight, I don't have to say much on his one, I have a rule, if I can't carry her out of a burning building, to save her and my life, I can't date her. <br>  21. They think too highly of themselves<br>  22. They don't have an ounce of modesty.<br>  23. Stop being a simp, have high standards, and marry a woman with class, loyalty, honesty, devotion, <br>  24.  ""Haven't gone through the sIoot phase and have friends who are still in the sIoot phase"".<br>  25. TATTOOS<br>  26. believe the man is there to serve her."

"Bill Maher is actually anti-woke when it comes to the alphabet people pushing their ""values"" on kids. Yes, he's on the left, but has more of classical liberal in his values.<br>I am totally Conservative Christian and I have to be honest about what I've seen Bill Maher stand up against. I would have to see the whole episode as to why Bill was telling these girls how they might end up seeing pron while browsing the internet, and what would they do if they DID have pron show up on their browsers.<br>As we saw, she said she'd close it out real fast and he agreed. He did not say, ""Go ask your teacher what this is about"".<br>We have to be honest, even if it's someone we do not like. We cannot take that short clip of Bill and automatically go to ""he's brooming"" them without seeing everything in context. I repeat, Bill Maher is anti-alphabet group targeting the young.<br>Okay, I paused your video and found the Bill Maher show (it's a podcast). The girls brought up how they learned during covid lockdowns. They brought up how they would search the internet for what they were interested in. Bill warns them about accidentally searching for something educations (like weather), then ""storms"", then ""Stormy Daniels"", and then adult content. The girls said they already have accidentally found that. Bill was not teaching them how to find pron.<br>So, although that podcast was more trying to get the kids to hate Trump, Bill was not trying to lead them down the rabbit hole toward adult content. He had told them they really have to be careful of what they click on. That's all that part of the clip was about.<br>I think it unfair to label him as a pred toward kids based off everything he's spoken about in the past as well as that ten second clip you showed. I highly doubt Bill is brooming kids here."

I'm not saying these people are having that conversation is a reasonable manner, but the conversation with the parents needs to happen earlier than those before the Internet Age."

Well, she’s in 2nd grade now, and I look back at the past couple years and thank god my wife is smarter than me, because the school system in California is so Woke and disturbed, and my daughter is so much better for not being exposed the nonsense. She reads at an 8th grade level, uses words some adults don’t even use, and is complete girl boss. Homeschooling is the only sane alternative these days!"

"I'm not sure how the person in the first clip meant to make their point. If they meant that they demand people obtain their consent before talking to them, good luck, because that's never going to be the norm.<br><br>However, asking someone if they're in a good place for having a tough conversation before launching into the subject is like a miraculous life hack. No matter what the topic is, it gives the other person a moment to prepare themselves to hear things that might be hard to hear. It will make them feel respected. Maybe they have things going on where now is not a good time for a hard conversation, and you can negotiate with them to set a time when it will be better. <br><br>If we want to just vent our frustrations regardless of how the other person feels, then feel free to ignore this advice. But if we want to have productive conversations that may actually solve problems, starting off by asking for permission to proceed sets everyone up for success there."

Sooo.... Taylor Swift is a Psy Op huh.... weird....
Mickey mouse got assaulted?....
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=600"">10:00</a> I don't agree with you on that one. Fresh and Fit are 2 rednecks in disguise, I would laugh in their faces too if they told me they get to do whatever they want while I have to stay faithful to some wetwipe."
children are open minded......I think you mean impressionable and uninformed.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=609"">10:09</a> The thing about a lot of those women though, is that they'll end up with 6 kids and all those kids will have different dads."
"alright, so heres the thing. if were gonna criticize the left on forcing their views down peoples throats and indoctinating people, we cant do the same thing. everyone deserves to live how they want to live, as long as it doesnt impede on others"
"Didn’t the guy @ <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=1181"">19:41</a> used to be in Hill Street Blues?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=81"">1:21</a> mf sounds like that one Ronald Mcdonald video💀💀💀"
Sometimes YouTube makes me RAGE at not being able to understand what is being said. He did WHAT with his grandma's implants? I have played it about ten times and can not understand it. Subtitles go gaga over the one word and I have played it .5x speed and still have no idea coupled with why would he have her implants if they aren't in her body? A cremation would destroy them so what the oh my goodness is going on here and why did it make you age twenty years? It honestly has made me Raaaaage trying to understand this.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=16"">0:16</a> That is Andy Milonakis right there! Sad part is I wasn't sure if he was being serious or doing a skit, so I went with skit."
I can’t watch this anymore. It’s too sad to think that this is the direction we are headed.
The woke and broken make such good content.
that bouncer was NOT built like a brick house.. maybe a bouncy house
"I have a vision that one day the left will look in the mirror and ask themselves, ""what the hell I have I become?"" I digress, they will double down on ugly."
Yes thank you that are psyopped the left are a massive psyop. I have been saying this for a few months now and you are the first person I have seen saying it.
brotha ewww
"What is the name of bill maher’s production company? It is called ‘Kid Love Productions”. But I’m sure that doesn’t mean anything, right? They wouldn’t just come out and tell us how evil they are, right? Unless it was like part of their secret evil religion to tell us all of the awful things they do, or something silly like that. I’m sure it’s nothing."
"I've referred to my 3yo niece as a baby before. Every time she responds with, ""No, I'm not a baby. I'm a big girl now."" Toddlers smart enough to know the difference."
The sheep brothers.
"Where was the parents to comfort that child, oh they probably left the kids there and went across street with camera to film poor scared child."
"Birth rates are dropping, That´s the plan."
Just a friendly reminder that Bill Maher owned a company named Kid Love Production
America has lost the plot. Leaders of the Clown World.
I love the angel Moroni.
"Thats actually not an irresponsible conversation to have with YOUR child, but I mean i feel like we are missing context here.  You should be talking to your kids about these things it happens earlier because of technology and if you don't someone else is going to."
So its confusing propaganda with solidaritiy?
is there a uncensored version?
"Dang...he was too annoying even for furries, now thats impressive"
"Maher is a creep, wtf was that!"
No wife happy life
im happy that furry fought back against the hater. dont judge a book by its cover (i aint a dharmann actor bud)
"What is a Plan B, she takes?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=78"">1:18</a> <br>Not Mickey Mouse crying on the ground 💀"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=290"">4:50</a> so many pdf files smh"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=792"">13:12</a> you agree with that guy harassing those people trying to praise god in their own way is fucked up. Lost me bye."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=1080"">18:00</a> I mean might as well just keep those legs open, they obviously don’t close much anyway…"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=1082"">18:02</a> Does anyone else smell fish?"
"You've used your yearly allotment of ""botha ewwww"". Ive never seennit and im already tired of it. Ffs, my man."
Furry: <b>cries in Mickey Mouse</b>
Total nutbags....End of.
taylor swift IS a 304 psy-op
I think Talor Swift is a Psyop LOLXD!
"I can almost grantee he was upset because the ""furry"" was putting on his hand paws. Kids at that age believe costume characters are real animals. You get this exact reaction at Disneyland when a character looses their head. It's called ""disillusion"" now send your hate comments lol..."
"For the thing of the furry I read it was the man in the first place who came there and started truly arranging them, idk"
furries being unhinged what a shock lol
"some psychos out there, I have noting against gays or bisexuals, im not religious imo they are normal as they are born like that, but these furries walking around in public not evben at a con is crazy"
Democrats are Crazy 😂 😅
Monogomy is biblical bro
Jojo siwa is the most obnoxious try-hard on the planet
Nasi events = Anything NOT SUPER far left. They'll eat their own eventually.
You see how they act when the WORD of GOD is spoken? They hate and are afraid of something they don't believe in.
"I never thought Taylor Swift was a psy-op until I heard 30 journalists say ""Taylor Swift is not a psy-op"". Now I'm thinking ""Hmmm 🤔 I think Taylor Swift might be a psy-op"" lol"
Poor jo jo is so messed up from being a child actor. She is stuck in the mindset of a 9 yo girl. At this point she is pitiful and sad.
"DUUDE <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=930"">15:30</a> almost punched my monitor"
Its disgusting how the left target our children. Cuz they xant have none of their own they try to hurt ours
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=273"">4:33</a> <b>that’s exactly what the Nazis did during WWII!!!</b> They put <i>all</i> their focus on children! (Hitler Youth Program) And that’s how the Nazis party grew. The children were made to think it was “I better believe that”, or you were bad!"
frankly i think training the leftist npc to only speak when spoken to is just fine
"So... at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=60"">1:00</a> was that a Dog Pile?"
the only part of this video i disagree with is the jiu jitsu clip. men and women roll with each other very often. my daughter rolls with boys in her age group and she can crush most of them despite being smaller than them. BJJ is designed for self defense and a main point of girls/women training BJJ is to defend themself against a boy/man.
Mental illness is rampant! 😵🥴😵‍💫
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=960"">16:00</a> well im fucked that bus stop by that dumpster with the pink on in belongs to Lynx, in Orlando Florida which is where i live."
"It's time to opt out of all of this. The only move we have now is completely avoid the satanic lawless. You can't even sue these people for breaking the law, they're above the laws."
Post Modernism was devised and implemented by adults who are attracted to non adults.<br><br>That's why a stated goal is to remove fathers from the home.<br>That's why they have sixualised society - which has opened the door to sixualising kids.<br><br>Drag Queen story hour - adult themed books in schools - easily accessible sites on the internet - the promotion of promiscuity - fashions that reveal lots of skin - adult themes in kids TV shows - six education for younger and younger kids - the demonisation of men (especially fathers)...
"Furries: ""WE ARE NOT A COMMUNITY OF SEXUAL PERVERTS!!!!!""<br>Also furries: ""Hey kids! Ever seen a red rocket?"" 💀"
"""man you look like you poop everywhere"" 💀💀"
What is a psy-op? I'm old and don't live online so I have no idea what this means.
Average dudes of the world unite lol
"To chase something, it has  to have the ability to run. Nothing is chasing you."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=416"">06:56</a> Why does this wench wriggle all over the place?<br><br>UNCLEAN!"
Jojo Siwa is so desperate for attention and fame. It'll only take another 2 to 3 yrs before she hits the wall and finally ODs
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=670"">11:10</a> - That's called ""sour grapes""."
"Damn, dudes give some of the worst advice in the world to other dudes."
thats the most EWW video ive see this year
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=600"">10:00</a> - No, not the West...just AMERICA!!"
"Man I feel so bad for those people who fell for the transition lie. Those changes permanently damage your body when the truth is, you probably just don't fit the molds people think you should. It sure would be better if we could help people learn to love themselves as they are"
MY GOD WHAT HAVE WE BECOME.
"...JoJo is looking like a 16 yr old boy with stupid ICP hair.<br>I preferred when i had never heard of this poor kid who has probably been passed around at ""industry parties""."
"""accurate facts"" is such an  American thing to say. Like ""past history""..."
"If all these things were natural to us humans, why do the governments and corporations have to shove acceptance of it down our throats every single day? Makes you think."
I think I want to become Amish.. sigh..
there trying to poison children..... i have no problem calling it for want it is.......
dude hit by megaphone sounded like greased up deaf guy :')
This video was an eye workout..
It would appear there is an entire generation with zero morals shame or education being prayed upon by older perverts who stayed hidden away until they convinced the woke idiots it’s ALL ok because it has a rainbow on it!! Wow! 😂😂🤡🤡
imagine getting beaten up by a furry
I think the taylor swift thing was ai
The Entertainment Industry is a psy op
Was that Andy Kauffman making a joke
Furry on Furry violence!
"The first one makes sense, kind of. Like, ""Hey, I've been going through something, is it alright if I talk to you about it?"" Not this whole, ""Do I have your consent?"" Just have a normal conversation"
"Memes aside, I really encourage you to watch Mohammad hoblus' lecture about real men. It is not so much about dawah [Islam preaching] as it is a real lecture that every man should watch and learn from."
I remember growing up and learning the difference between acceptance and tolerance when it came to social justice type stuff. One requires the other to agree & change while the other makes space for both stances neither person being required to change. I miss those days.
I’d NEVER WALK THE GRASS of a PRIDEFUL Church! 🤮
Local news is how they keep the old people programmed. They repeat the lines from the national newsgroups. Just actors. Journalism is dead.
"I knew a long time ago that a lot of woke lefties are pedophiles, but damn, they aren't even hiding it anymore."
"Bill Maher says he hates those kids, so it's ok.  I guess."
This is where affirmative consent laws end up
"This fits perfectly with the clown statements throughout the video<br><br>To quote Funhouse by Pink <br>This used to be a fun house, but now it’s full of evil clowns <br>I suppose it you can remove evil though <br>I wouldn’t say all the people are evil per-say🤷"
The Taylor swift psyop compilation was hilarious and chilling

"""When your born into this world you get a ticket to the freak show. And if your born in America you get a front row seat."" George Carlin"
"Haha 😂 he is aloud to record im with him but, that dudes voice! Haha"
"Furrys have a rap for being pretty cringy at times, but kudos for standing up for yourself against the ashhole who was actually harassing you (and not some imagined harassment)."
dude sounded like ronald mcdonald.
"Home schooling is the dumbest thing people ever came up with. Children need to socialize and experience things, keeping them in a house all day is like putting them into prison. We need to get rid of the woke teachers not punish and hurt kids."
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=780"">13:00</a> that church was desperate for members so they had to lower their standards 😂"
Please don't give a horse under them😂😂
The video of the boy wrestling the girl was crazy he clearly had her pinned.
"I have never heard a man howl like that in my life. Bill Maher is a creep. Fat Acceptance is deadly. These students are idiots, Charlie Kirk smokes these kids all the time."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=137"">2:17</a> As a furry myself I have not yet even once heard about this, lmao. But nah they ain’t making it look any better for the rest of us."

"Thanks feminist hairy girls, you are absolutely NOT helping girls like me feel better about PCOS."
That's what they want for us to give up and move. That way they have full control of the state
That's what they want for us to give up and move. That way they have full control of the state
"Still trying to figure out Fresh/Fit/Sneako's (idk which one it is, I'm too old to figure it out) reasoning why it's ridiculous for a man to remain loyal and monogamous when he's put in the work to be successful."

"I love being from the hills of KY, we don't put up with any of this, we have had a few shooting but that's more of the meth heads going crazy."
Why is Bill Mahr questioning a child about stormy daniels...
Oh no i didn’t realize you were another jontron. I’ll just take my black ass to the unsubscribe button.
Was that furry recording itself ?
"I will never forgive GriffinMind for exposing me to that ""Brother eewww"" clip. Now, I can't stop saying it.😂"
This heresy must end.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=194"">3:14</a> stopped watching. Why? Because children with imaginary friends pretending to be men is cringe, time to grow up little fella, all gods are disproven with 100% certainty. Dont agree? Start crying, I as a grown man don't care about  the hurt feelings of a manchild🖕"
The mainstream media is a psyop! Repeated adinfinitum!
"Not surprised about Billy boy, early life history pattern recognition."
"Furry is NOT woke. Every time you bring up furries in your content, you show how narrow minded you are and totally unaccepting of anything that YOU do not agree with. Your showing you are just as bad as the leftist people. I have seen a lot of furries that are completely cringe as hell, but that doesn't make them woke or anything close to the BS you try to push. Always disappointing how badly you can bring your own content down when you start acting exactly like the people you are making fun of..."
Trump the world needs Trump fact .I mean look at this madness 😠 what the fugg?
"""Brother ewwwwww, what's that!"" That's become part of my daily dialog over the last several weeks.🤓👍"
There should be a leash law for furries. There is for dogs!
"I’ve got a question for you because I am a boomer. I don’t understand how you make money doing content. With that being said if you lost all of your followers tomorrow, what would you do because Japan’s pretty strict on foreigners living there you have to be able to speak the language to get a job, and my question is what type of job or career did you have before social media. Because if our government does what Australia did and Canada by limited free speech, you could possibly lose everything with a push of a button."
"""When they are deserving.""  no man deserves her, trust me."
The kid at the end doesn't need to have been home schooled. This is something that comes naturally to children. They only start saying otherwise when someone injects that idea into their minds.
The cool thing about fat acceptance is it ironically helps thin the population
That Bill Maher clip is so damn disturbing first of all if you're a f*<b>***</b> parent and you let your kids on any sort of device and you haven't put parental controls on it you have failed as a parent
it actuall was a good ewwwwwpisode
"bill maher (a ""jew"") talking to your kids :D"
"I love these . One part of western cultures are mentally insane and another part is pro home schooling , misogynistic idiots. Good! good ! keep fighting ."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=415"">6:55</a> Yooo, the unnatural swaying and random knowledge of words like ""Septuagint"". That woman has a demon."
"To be honest, I’m starting to see it as demonic manifestations when people attack others for preaching or quoting scripture. Pray for her, she’s willing to be violent which means she’s not doing ok 🙏"
"Your ""brotha ehhhwww"" is flawless😅"
Great work! Absolutely inspiring commentary thank you!
"It's not hard to explain to your children why there are full grown adults dressed in costumes in public. I've told me children what's up. There are mentally ill people in this world, and they like to be weird and freaks in public. They know what's up."
I can't stand my brother by blood. Nor do I know his kids. But one thing they aren't woke propaganda kids.<br>Point is the wrestling video. My ig nephew began wrestling in school.  They matched him against a Lil high-school girl.  He wouldn't wrestle her and declared the defeat. People were actually happy for her win. He took the loss. It kinda blew his motivation to rank. Idk. Sodom and Gomorrah.  It always came full circle in history.
yes brother ewwwww
I had time understanding how that dude could cry hysterically over not all that much. Then they explained he was a furry who got denied and it suddenly made perfect sense 🤣
"everyone copying Blair White's ""fat people died"" video"
wtf am i watching with bill maher
If you are dressing up like animals to play with your friends is nuts the mental health issues in this country are pretty bad is there any morals or values left in these idiots wow. As far as bill if you ever said anything like that to my kids your going to have a problem
NONE of this crap would exist if there WASN'T any social media......just sayin'............
"Bill Maher has slowly been moving to the middle, the farther the left goes, the more he moves to the middle. While this clip talking to kids about that subject IS creepy, since he isn't their parent, I just wanted to point out that a lot of his recent content over the past couple years has been pretty moderate (I think his politics are Libertarian, but not 100% on that)"

"unfortunately I saw furry few weeks ago in my hometown of Bratislava in Slovakia which is like middle/eastern europe. He or she I dont know was with his mother shopping in local grocery store and more than anything I was just angry at that woman. She striked me as a single mother and I was like why do you allow this to happend, but most of all I was horrified. I seen it only on internet from you western guys and this was first time I saw it IRL in my general location. Not even eastern europe is safe from this woke virus. Not even deeply controling CCP China is safe from this virus."

My problem with being encouraged to chase women is that that constitutes harassment under the law and if they change their mind you're f'ed if you weren't born into a den of lawyers.

I know why Democrats are allowing all this insanity in blue states. They want to drive out the democrats who won’t change their voting habits to red states until they control all states then to stop the insanity they created they will enact martial law and with no guns we won’t be able to stop them.
"Ladies, you can be strong-willed and feminine. They are not inherent contradictions."
i never see someone nailing brotha ewwwww!! you got talent bro
Crazy that someone would wear a fur suit to the beach...
"Sorry, man.  I'm bailing with 10 minutes to go.  Have a great day."
"Your impression of ""brotha uuuuhh."" is almost perfect. Well done."
Society is why I do not want children. Treated me like garbage why would I have my child go through it.
FURRIE fury. A hair ball of contentment.

"Dudes in a fishnet wife beater and the waist band of his under wear is showing. If you really left the house thinking that was attractive, maybe don't reproduce please, then again, those types usually don't aim to reproduce anyway... Thank god."
"I can't hate on Jojo for getting wrecked on her 21st.  It's that one day that everyone does that, ya know.  But if it was all the time, then no."
Ay griffin if you rlly want a safe place with safe community I really recommend you looking at Islam and how it makes senses I really hope you check it out and it give it a try fr man
Furries literally run the entirety of the IT industry we'd be severely crippled without them 😅
That guy voice bount 1.30 is definitely the muffins man 😅😅😊
"I actually do appreciate someone letting me know when they want to discuss something heavy instead of just lobbing it at me unexpected. It lets me get into the right headspace or let them know that I'm not available right now for whatever reason and to do it later. Really, I appreciate it when someone asks ""hey, got a minute?"" or something to that equivalent before getting into it with whatever subject they want to address. This has nothing to do with trauma or anything and is more about respect for each other."
How do live with yourself after wailing like a girl because you got lynched by scooby doo??

Trying to eat breakfast while watching this vid wasn't the best idea...  🤮
Yep he trying to get in their knickers lol such a lame tactic this makes u a loser lol just like the yes men
Taylor who?
The sad thing about that girl on the podcast talking about how much she takes plan b is that other young girls are going to see that and think because shes seemed fine in that video that its ok for them to do it to and the crazy thing is shes proud and laughing about it... imagine how stupid shes gonna feel when she has some sort of physical repercussion from doing that
2 brain cells fighting for 3rd place is the best way to describe these clips.
So Taylor Swift is a psych op.
Only time ive kneeled was for my fallen troops
"Woke people all have a look that is a tell. You know exactly what I mean. It's a common trait, weakness, defeatism and self victimization as well as an angry and begrudging acceptance of what they see as global or universal victimization. They all look like they are being abused and the likely culprit in every case is them. I don't spend my days hating on people but something is endlessly frustrating about this crowd. Not one of them has ever even begun to realize their real power instead they are all about dragging all of us into their own self involved sub realities based upon their weaknesses. I'm sorry but the time to cut the chord never doesn't arrive. Wokeness is an extension of very wrong and very childlike assumptions that those of low mental capacity seem to absorb through the open air. Let's bring some independence, some adultness, and some hope for a better future into this next election. Not one of us, no matter our differences, is going sit comfortably over the next 10 years of life knowing that we didn't do so."
OHHHHH MY GOD taylor swift IS A PHUKING PSY-OPpppp😳
I was taking a drink of coffee when that kid put those implants in his mouth.  The taste instantly soured.

"That poor young kiddo, just screaming in terror. Fleeing the establishment, and sobbing uncontrollably when encountering one of those Furry people.<br><br>I hear ya, buddy. I hear ya. They confuse us too."

"""That revolution brings out instincts of primordial barbarism, the sinister forces of envy, greed, and hatred—this even its contemporaries could see all too well. They paid a terrible enough price for the mass psychosis of the day, when merely moderate behavior, or even the perception of such, already appeared to be a crime. But the twentieth century has done especially much to tarnish the romantic luster of revolution which still prevailed in the eighteenth century. As half-centuries and centuries have passed, people have learned from their own misfortunes that revolutions demolish the organic structures of society, disrupt the natural flow of life, destroy the best elements of the population and give free rein to the worst; that a revolution never brings prosperity to a nation, but benefits only a few shameless opportunists, while to the country as a whole it heralds countless deaths, widespread impoverishment, and, in the gravest cases, a long-lasting degeneration of the people.""-Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn"
They have been saying we are coming for your children and now parents are delivering them via their marches.

Amen.<br><br>Too bad this philosophy (anti-woke) is a minority in my country, because I totally agree with Griffin. <br>You see here (the Netherlands) that libelalism has taking a manifestation of all our eductions, my generation and the one following, etc. It saddens me to see that we are way to busy to listen how to adress a man and a woman and that we are not even allowed to call them that. <br><br>Where has basic knowledge gone to? Why do we listen to woke minority so much? Why am lectured by my own government about acceptance and liberalism? Why am I shamed for being a conservative and not a liberalist?<br><br>I swear, as soon as I have enough, I’m out of here to a more traditional country."

"Strong women are not inherently bad. Me and my wife have 4 kids. When my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years ago she continued to work, care for our kids and kept a stiff upper lip for them. When it was just me and her she could be small, weak and scared. When they took her right breast she was strong again and showed me the result even though she was afraid I'd leave her but we kept going."
This world is puzzling at times. Wowza
How do you know what is under the Furry costume? Do you look to the bulge like a hunter does before engaging a deer. Some guy is going to accidentally hurt a woman or child wearing a costume because they think they are an actual wolf

Imagine getting floored by a furry and then crying about it.
