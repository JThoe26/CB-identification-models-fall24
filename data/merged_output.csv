“they never told me I couldn’t sing” what in the ariana grande from victorious
“THEY DIDNT SAY I COULDNT SIIINGGGGG!” -kat from victorious that one episode
You’re very brave for having the comment section on
i didn’t know what her response would be but i never could’ve imagined this.
This is so insulting to the victims.........
I had a feeling Colleen would come back and do something like this
I actually can&#39;t believe this is real. The sad thing is that it is clear she put a bunch of effort into this song.
"Well, I have to hand it to her. This is the most original apology video I’ve seen."
Be so for real Colleen. Make a real apology and take accountability for your actions.
“ The only thing I’ve ever groomed🪒 is my two Persian cats🐈🐈‍⬛ Not a groomer👧 Just a loser🫵” goes hardddd🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥🔥
zero days without nonsense
i fucking love the internet so much
This response was a choice
i need a break from 2023
Idk if there&#39;s a NOT creepy way to be messaging young fans lol...
I saw this on Tik Tok and refused to believe it was real. I can’t believe it 💀
keep in mind this is a grown ass woman
We are witnessing history rn 🫡
She only feels sorry for herself. What about the affected children?! Not an ounce of accountability in this „apology“ video…
This is the wildest thing I’ve ever seen on this app
this cant be real
😧 &lt;- me this entire video
I guess she gets points for singing and creativity?
Girl.
The allegations are on film girl
"erm, there’s literally mounts of screenshots and evidence lol"
HE DIDNT SAYYYY I COULDNT SIIIIIIIIIIIINGGG
Bruh.
Life isn&#39;t real 😭
Not a fucking ukulele lmfao
I can&#39;t believe this is real omg
All I can think about is the victims watching this.... I can&#39;t believe this
girl how is it lies and misinformation there is a plethora of truth 😭
"Colleen, this apology video is very well done. Your singing is simply sublime. I especially liked the fact that you played your ukelele in A Minor, you played it very professionally."
Are you kidding me
Colleen you cant be serious with this
this going straight to the playlist 🔥
girl whens this dropping on spotify?
The hook low key slaps
GIRL there’s so much evidence bsfr
Most creative youtuber apology video ever
this is weird as hell lol.
2023 is weird
DELETE THIS WHILE YOU CANNNNN LIKE WHATTTT
this is NOT REAL LMAOOOO
no way 😭
I admire your courage for keeping the comments on.
"People aren’t “having fun” with these “rumors” they are speaking out about trauma you caused. It’s not fun for them to do so. It’s traumatic. But you made it all about you, sorry you feel like shit."
&quot;HE DIDN&#39;T SAY I COULD&#39;T SIIIING!&quot; - Cat Valentine
This is...something
Oof. This ain’t it.
Its giving that vegan teacher
"finally! i can feel bad for you and not the victims. amazing, thank you Colleen."
"Instead of listening to your team, you come out with this tone deaf song. There&#39;s videos of you talking about inappropriate things with CHILDREN! I&#39;m saying this as someone who said and did manipulative shit to others and I thank goodness I had friends who chewed me out. I am telling you now, Collen, you are the wrong. You should not have been talking to children and you&#39;re not taking accountability. You did this video where you sing about how you feel horrible and then you stopped to talking about how people are toxic and how they don&#39;t care about your apologies. It comes off as high and mighty, manipulative as well as flippant. You would have been better not saying anything because now you&#39;ve made sure that everyone knows you don&#39;t care and aren&#39;t taking it seriously."
"Yes, im disappointed in your song. I thought you wuld be an adult for once and take accountability for your actions Colleen."
Vampire by Olivia Rodrigo or Toxic Gossip Train by Colleen Ballinger? Which is the song of the summer
Okay I must say this is creative
Wow this girl is literally playing the victim right now 💀✋🏼 I can’t even
this is the most entertaining app
bro really pulled out the musical instrument lmaooo
GIRL-😭😭😭😭
Im going to quote this for the rest of my life
Horrified looks from everyone in the room… 😳
beyond disrepectful. i feel so bad for the victims.
the chorus lowk goes hard
this is the best youtube apology ever made
Wow…Girl you just seem mad and bitter.
YO WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS LMFAOOOO
🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️🧍🏽‍♀️
"Colleen, be strong in who you are. We know your heart, and we too can see through the lies.  This response was spot on, gutsy, and true!"
what accountability did you take??🤨
what a banger
Oh this is quirky
You are loved. You are valued. We know you are only human. Don&#39;t let them dim your light.
I feel bad for the victims. This video was probably a slap across the face
THIS CANNOT BE EFFING REAL
THIS CAN&#39;T BE REAL
THE ENDING😭😭
she’s pulling cat’s “he didn’t say i couldn’t sing” omg
This can’t be happening in real time 😩
Catchy though
What in the millennial
it’s giving cat valentine ‘ they didn’t say i couldn’t sing ‘ but from a horrible person .
She really doesn’t care abt this situation at all bc what the fuck is this💀
What is this
LMAOOOOOOOO
This was.... interesting?
Chat is this REAL???? Girl what are you doing????
this is embarrisng
This is catchy 😭
Yikes. Let&#39;s keep the uke out of apology videos.
Like this if your watching in 2024
girl......be fr
Honestly hun you are brave to have comments on 😂😂😂<br><br>She wants that last pay check frfr
Making a situation this serious into a jokey song is just so tone deaf? Yikes
idk what i was expecting from her apology video but NOT THIS 😃
Why is this catchy though
yo this kinda a bop😜😍
cornball
every few weeks i remebrr this exists and i love watching it over and over
"You are really skilled at deflecting!! Go off all the way to accountability town, big yikes."
"this is definitely an odd way of apologizing, but it seems genuine and i feel bad for her"
Y&#39;all need Jesus
steven universe ass response 😭😭
Stay Strong. Don’t let the ohio edgers fanum tax you
This is so 2020.😆😐
it DOESNT matter what your intention is once your actions already hurt others
the beginning is giving cat from victorious singing “they didn’t say i couldn’t singgggg”😭😭😭
I’m sorry that you are going through this. I still believe in you even if no one else does
&quot;he didn&#39;t say i couldn&#39;t sing&quot;
i&#39;m crying what is this 😭😭😭
Geez…
"This song is taken as insensitive , but knowing Colleen it’s her way of showing that she cares."
they didn’t say i couldn’t sing is giving that one episode of victorious where cat can’t talk
This might be the most iconic video of 2023.
girl i never said i was perfect but i do leave kids alone SO ..
I don’t think people understand this video.  It’s very serious.  She’s showing us she isn’t doing well.  Art and music is her way of processing it.  She’s definitely not taking anything lightly. If you know Colleen you know what I mean.
that was… definitely a video!
no fucking way LMAOOO
Girl you could have saved yourself...
"Lmao, Genius 😂"
This is the most unhinged thing I have ever seen. Stop playing the victim when there are actual victims???
Am I in a fever dream….. this can’t really be your response
This was so manipulative “she didn’t deserve to d!e” “she didn’t survive the crash” as if your saying if something happened to you it would be because of everyone calling you out on your bad mistakes? Idkk.
"honestly, i respect the game"
This wasn’t a good idea Colleen 🤦🏻‍♀️
This is such weird behaviour... and creepy.
Way to take this seriously. Smh
I DONT GET HOW ANYONE COULDNT LIKE COLLEEN LIKE SHES SO ICONIC FOR THIS
"gabbie hanna 2.0, she’s finally lost it 💀"
Need an apology video for this video. Immediately. No ukulele or song next time
Bruh
"i cant say how sorry i am that this is all happening to you colleen. just know that the people that really love and support you always will, and people make mistakes because were all human just as you said. we still love you colleen!! im so sorry youre getting these horrifying rumors about you spread all over."
actually no way
this doesn’t look genuine at all omg
girl bye.
this song is a banger tho
Are you kidding me
You took time off and this is what you thought would be the appropriate response? Perhaps more time off is necessary because what is this?
So we’re calling screenshots rumors now?
People these days are so mean and hateful. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone is human. Yeah I&#39;m probably gonna get hate for this..I don&#39;t care I&#39;m still gonna be fan and support her. Take care of yourself Colleen❤
I don’t think ANYONE is having fun.
Yaaaas queen! Give us nothing 🥰
wow she really was homeschooled huh
I believe Colleen..and I believe she is not a bad person.
Most apology of all time
"smh,take account for it instead of whatever is this"
"Shame on you, Colleen. Any small chance you may have had at redemption is long gone."
Girl glad you’re okay. Been waiting for any update from you. Take your time and this too shall pass❤
This can’t be real???
Girl😭
Wait the beginning part is giving cat in victorious saying “ BUT THEY DIDNT SAYY I COULDNT SIIIINGGGGGGG”💀💀💀
So when is this on spotify?
LMAOOO WHAT IS THIS?!?!?!
?
It’s the way you THOUGHT you ate that
I fucking love you Colleen
Wow this is worse than watching micheal scott giving laptop batteries to the kids 😭😭........
oh hell no
Aww thanks but we don&#39;t forgive you ❤❤❤
"❤ as someone who’s your age and found you when we were both already moms, thank you for who you are now. Thank you for the example of a mother you are. I miss your vlogs and your family. Take care of yourself through this storm - know many of us care about you and miss you, it may just not be as loud as some other voices right now ❤"
Woah. Don’t think this was the move you thought it was. 👀 EWWW. Listen to her victims.
Bro not her pulling a cat valentine from victorious &quot;they didn&#39;t say I couldn&#39;t sing&quot; PLEASEEEE
GIRLBYEEEE😭😭
"You have helped me through so so so much, ignore everybody else and listen to me. You are amazing and if some things were pulled from your past that were said wrong, who cares! You have done more good than anybody I have ever met in my whole life. If all of the top comments are mean I hope that you find just this one and you get off your device knowing that you are an amazing human that so many humans love and adore SOOOO much! I hope that one day when you are more comfortable that you will continue to make yt videos because they help me so so so much! I am so glad you made this video, I love you."
girl
what part of the song is about when u killed ur dog
i think staying quite would have been better than this honestly.. making it into a corny song when the allegations have to do with kids.
Absolutely not.
I love you girly ❤ keep your head up.
haha sorry what😂😂 this was not on my list of apologies she was gonna do
A good person wouldn&#39;t make this video
ummm...
Y’all need to let her handle stuff the way she wants. It’s her life
Oh that’s not…
this is so disrespectful to the victims smh
ain&#39;t no way....
I have missed you so much! Sending you giant hugs ❤😞
i didnt think youtube apology videos could get any worse..
did she even say sorry? or like... she says mistake singular
"her PR team told her not to speak on the issue, so she sang about it instead!"
"I support you in this. You already apologized and addressed the things you did wrong years ago, so why should you apologize again for that, and additional things you don&#39;t believe you did? I&#39;m glad to see you aren&#39;t letting cancel culture win and bowing to their demands. Please stay strong against it and don&#39;t cave and delete this or apologize when an apology is not deserved."
I don’t know what to think anymore
Come on here to take accountability? Good one! Hahah you are indeed a comedian.
Girl…. 🤦🏽‍♀️
"Look, people are never going to be happy with any apology she gives no matter what format. If you forgive her, do it. If you don’t, then you’re no better trying to tear someone down day after day."
Gabbie Hanna is that you?
i want to laugh at how ridiculous and embarassing this is for a grown woman to be doing but then i remember the victims and suddenly it ain&#39;t funny anymore
r u serious rn
KEEP YOUR HEAD UP ❤YOUR DOING A GREAT JOB ❤
okay Cat Valentine “he didn’t say I couldn’t siiinnnggg.”<br><br>This is horrific.
Girl what is this response.
How did you make this last ten awful minutes
Honestly if u guys were/ are a fan of Colleen you would be supporting her not trying to tear her down
That was nothing really 😅
When is this dropping on spotify
Wow. Just wow.
We still believe in you Colleen! Stay strong 🩷
ok this just feels like mocking the victims😭
Colleen… you can not be serious. This was the wrong move anything would be better then this.
Ain’t no way 💀💀💀💀
This is a WILD response
I&#39;M YELLING CAUSE EVERYONE ELSE IS YELLING!
Omg.. no way it&#39;s real.. •-•
girl bffr
This is in bad taste
This shit is heat colleen 🙌
This is the only video I&#39;ve seen by you.  I don&#39;t know all the details of this controversy so I&#39;m not going to accuse you of anything.  All I&#39;m saying is that you went about the complete wrong way of addressing it.
girl BFFR.
is accountability in the room
Ain&#39;t even gonna lie this song if fire 🔥
This is so weird.
ok
Hi
I’m glad you responded like this. People have been hating on you so hard for a misunderstanding
Be so fucking for real right now
girl bye
Girl...
Sending you a big hug - Remember that there are still so much love towards you in this fandom &lt;3<br>Love you &lt;3
No. Just no.
What about your brother ?? Umm ok
This is awful. Take it down. It’s really cruel to the victims.
I’ve watched you for 10 years and I’m not going anywhere. I love you and I hope you are okay 😢❤
I’m uh-
seek help
Dropping on Spotify?
Does she do birthday parties?
lmaaoooooooooo no way
HE DIDN&#39;T SAYYYYYY I COULDN&#39;T SINNNGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!
it’s giving cat valentine ‘ they didn’t say i couldn’t sing ‘ but weird..
You really can sing!!!
THEY DIDN’T SAY I COULDN’T SINGGGGG
oh no babe
No…way. Absolutely no way. Wow
"I don’t understand these people or this world anymore. Colleen, you’ve been nothing but an amazing positive influence on my life. You got me through two horrible pregnancies and my babies NICU stay. My daughter and Flynn are months apart, Flynn in two months younger. My NICU girl was born on the same day, one year after your twins and I sat and rewatched your videos crying through the pain with you. You will always hold a special place in my heart and so many others. Thank you for being you and bringing a light to my life for so many years. 🖤"
LOL
This randomly came up and i don&#39;t have any context ...
what the hell girl
I’m proud of you for sticking up for yourself. I don’t think anyone deserves to be persecuted and have their livelihood completely taken away because of past mistakes they have already owned up to and learned from.
"You did change my mind, for the worse. Listen to your team."
What 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
THIS IS AWFUL
You are loved Colleen!
BOO BOOO 🍅🍅🍅🍅
When will this drop on Spotify
Oh no! Colleen this was not better then talking this was worse
&quot;They didn&#39;t say I couldn&#39;t sing&quot;
B IF YOU DONT- 😂😂😂😂😭😭😭😭😭💀💀💀💀💀
Taking notes from cat valentine. “He didn’t say I couldn’t siiiiing” 😭
THEY DIDNT SAY I COULDNT SIIINNNGGGGGGGG
"I appreciate you Colleen.<br><br>I understand what you’re going through and have been through similar life ruining slander and betrayal myself.<br><br>Appreciate your art piece here and the message is wonderful.<br><br>Thankyou for expressing, persisting and overall existing,<br><br>Much love❤"
"oh baby, no."
So Colleen decided to completely end her whole career with this video. Even if there was a sliver of a chance she could come back... not after this!
this is so fucking weird😭
When is it dropping on Spotify🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
“They never said I couldn’t SIIIINNGGG” - Cat Valentine
goodnight
👁️👄👁️
Im sorry colleen i know how it feels when it seems no matter what youre still in the wrong. Haters will always hate and they never seem to let the past go no matter how much you have grown since them. I hope you get through this!
Omg Song of the summer?!!!😜
"DIDNT DESERVE TO DIE WHAT,,,,,,"
GIRL BFFR
Girl I love you !!! I wish people understand you are human! I made mistakes that I full regret. Keep strong!!❤❤❤❤
I was here 4:20pm june 28
What a sad excuse of a response💀
this cannot be real life
"I love Colleen, believing everything in the internet from years ago isn&#39;t something I&#39;ll do, I miss you, Flinn, and the twins so much!!"
oop. girl this is... wow😭😭
…
The internet is a magical thing
They didnt say i couldn&#39;t Ssiiiiiingggg
This cannot be real right now
….
.....no
Cancel culture is so weird
girl fr
Are we on the subway??? What the fuck!
You’re kidding
Girl please don’t let these people get to you!!! Your true fans love you and will always stand up for you! We know you and what people are say is not you. Sending the biggest hug!!!❤
No way.
Oh no
"oof. I&#39;ve never seen a Miranda yt vid. I saw you on Comedians in Cars...I couldn&#39;t finish it because I didn&#39;t get the shtick. I did see your pregnancy story videos, tho. This &quot;apology&quot; is pretty abysmal. As a mom and big-time content creator, don&#39;t be sorry, be proactive. Create a commitee of creators to make regulations to protect children on and off all platforms. YT is the wild west. This was a waste of your time."
"Let it out, girl ❤"
girl?
🍅🍅🍅🍅
LOL girl please
Well it changed my mind about you ❤❤❤
it&#39;s... original!
oh my GOD shes weird
wow
ok maybe this is just a starter apology and she&#39;ll make another one
HE DIDN&#39;T SAY I COULDN&#39;T SIIIING!!
That was…..weird.
LMAOOOO??????
Sounds like a hit to me. Can you make a radio edit?
THEY DIDN&#39;T SAY I COULDN&#39;T SINGGGGGG
😂😂This is funny.
SMH
people say this is a bad apologize but I don&#39;t think she is trying to even apologize lol<br>just a way to say she&#39;s fed up?
Girl.
Ooooooooof
girl …. lmao 👎
"You’re human my love, nobody but you and those involved knows the true facts behind everything that happened, its nobodies business. It’s not normal to have a bunch of teenagers constantly messaging you, you reacted in the only way you thought was right at the time, we know your intentions were pure. I’m sorry this has happened, i’m sorry you are being bullied, you still have fans that love you. Look after yourself my love ❤"
NO WAY LMAO
LMAO HUH
O.o
"Please everyone think before you say things as it&#39;s so easy to jump to conclusions.<br>Even if she made mistakes she isn&#39;t the same person she is now.<br>Don&#39;t hold things against her because she made fart jokes.<br>Overall just please be kind ♥"
Non of this seemed genuine at all
girl ikyfl
<b>Lmao get bent</b>
<b>honestly thought this was kinda genius. why people hate for no reason.</b> 😅
this was odd...
GIRL BE FFR!!
What woow
I love you so much colleen this storm shall pass and I hope you are doing okay! Don&#39;t let this get you down and spend some time with family and friends! It&#39;s gonna be okay!
"Colleen! I genuinely hope you read this because you were such an amazing person and unfortunately in the day and age we live in now people are insecure and get bored and like to pray on peoples downfalls and bring up past events just for an ounce of entertainment. You truly do not deserve any of the hate you’re receiving, please continue to keep your head up and stand up for what you think is right! My friends and I love you and look up to you so much! We will always support you❤️"
Im still here colleen ❤️
“They diddnnnntt sayyyy I couldn’t singggggg!”
You actually have my respect for not turning off the comments
This is awesome.
Ok regardless of the real intentions behind this video…the song is good and she is very talented. We can’t deny that
this is fye bro🔥🔥 cant wait for the next track! 🫶🏽
"I LOVE YOU COLLEEN! Everyone makes mistakes, you’re just on the internet where the whole world can judge you. You matter and you’ve helped many people, including me. Keep going 🤍"
still a catchy lil tune that is stuck in my head for the last 3 months and happy to say I know all the words!!
Is this dropping on Spotify???
Im happy to see your face Colleen! I will forever be a fan
SLAY 💅🏽
What a banger
I love you!! I love you!! I love you!! I miss your vlogs!! Be safe and keep healing!!
Love and miss you! People act like they’ve never made mistakes in their lives.  I’ve been so amazed by how you call yourself out and own any mistakes you believe you’ve made even when none appear to be present.  Constantly learning and growing. Please show yourself the grace you so often show for other people.  I have always and will always cheer you on!
I love you so much Colleen! Keep on going because you are so much better than the things that are being said abt you
Also stop hating on her she will post another video just wait
"i’m on your side colleen, please don’t feel like you’re going through this alone cuz you’re not💕💕hope you’re doing well"
Anyone here in December 2023 <br>👇🏻
Is anyone else just tired of cancel culture???
"Can&#39;t cancel Colleen, she&#39;s a genius and wanted to be in touch and cool with her fans. Everyone relax."
if you guys know her she always makes songs to like talk about her emotions i think this was her way of at least saying something until she is allowed to make a sit down video and actually talk about everything in depth
I’m sorry Colleen. I still support you ❤️
points for creativity?
"Few days ago I had no idea who you are but wow, iconic"
Is this on Spotify?
and the song isn’t even good .. girl
My most streamed Spotify song of the year
This is the most random but creative apology ever.
this is a bop
"I don&#39;t really know the story, but that&#39;s a catchy song."
Me realizing that the last day of 2023 is 123123 proof 12/31/23
SHE APOLOGISED AND TOOK ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESE THINGS YEARS AGO!!!! Leave her alone. I support Colleen 100%
I honestly hate to think that people are trying to cancel her. Cancel culture is horrible. There is no way that she is a groomer she has children herself. I dont get it
"I’m with u girl, ur good, we r all people"
Love you Colleen!
On Spotify when
WHEN THE ALBUM??
"I love you Colleen, you are such an amazing soul. people will spread so much about good people. it’s gonna be okay girl. &lt;3"
&quot;HE DIDN&#39;T SAY I COULDN&#39;T SIIINNNNGGGGGG&quot;
The haters who are talking trash …. Who have wantched her for years now have watched her grow … mistakes happen . She’s human and she’s admitting how she feels . She’s a person too just like me and you …and everyone else on the internet …. She’s still an amazing person . In my books . I love you and your content . Your one of the fair actual genuine person . Seems genuine people are rare in 2023 now … i still support you Colleen . Your true fans and friends and family  will always stand by you . *hugs *
"I want to say to everyone here;  I wish you all good things, and overload of LOVE! Give or get a hug today ❤"
i loved this
"Shine on, you’ve got this💗"
I’m here for you!!!❤
I mean the chorus is kind of catchy though
HE DIDNT SAY I COULDNT SINGGG
IS THIS ON SPOTIFY
Love it!❤
SONG OF THE SUMMER JUST DROPPED!! 🔥🔥
Ngl the song is pretty catchy
This is low-key incredible
You are awesome love you Colleen you have inspired me so much 🎉❤❤❤❤❤
I mean...  As cringe as this is. She&#39;s not wrong about cancel culture.
"Colleen,  YouTube is a harsh place to put your life on.  I’ve watched you for years and every day since the start of Covid!  I just want you to remember and know you are loved.  You are going through a very difficult situation and I know from experience in my life that when something you love and something that defines who you are as a person gets ripped from you because of a mistake or rumors or hateful people it can be so overwhelming and feel so awful that you start to question who you are as a person and what is your purpose for being here.  Let me tell you in case you haven’t heard it from anyone but the people closest to you,  you are worthy of forgiveness for your mistakes!  You are worthy of love and not just from those closest to you right now.  You have touched many people and done so much good.  Don’t let other people’s agendas and need for gossip define who you are right now!  Let “them” cancel you!  You don’t exist to make “them” happy!  I feel like from being a part of your life for the past few years that the mistakes made in the past are just that, the past!  I’m still rooting for you and your family and I know I’m not the only one!"
Your voice is so amazing❤️
i cannot believe the things these people are saying colleen has always tried her best to be genuine and authentic even when she was going through shit or happiest ever she has made the choice to always be open  and share her life.. y&#39;all are acting like you have never even said a bad word or shit even dropped a drink on carpet! she&#39;s a human being who makes mistakes and has feelings she is a real person trying to live with her family in this fucked up world(which y&#39;all are quite literally making it worse) what&#39;s the point of taking time out of your day to type a hateful comment ab sb past or mistake they ever made what is the point let&#39;s bsffr what joy does it bring you???!!!?
Colleen I truly LOVE you and I know you might not read this but I hope you know that just cause you made a mistake however many years ago I believe you have tried you’re hardest to redeem yourself
I love you Colleen
Is this on spotify
You need to move on.  Just start. Vloging again .Don&#39;t let them win they are just jealous.   Move on for your kids vlog vlog vlog.
"❤❤❤ I love this! Stay strong, I love you 😢"
"Uhh Colleen, I don’t think this is the best way to respond… I was a fan and now I don’t know if I can still like you"
Yo this is fire 🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️💯💯💯
I’m sorry but she’s right….. I’m not saying what she did is correct or incorrect because I don’t know what is true or untrue but now a days society is so ready to jump and destroy people’s lives with things that happened in the past or mistakes they have made. It’s not fair. People change and make mistakes. It’s not fair to hold it over their head forever
girl keep strong and dont let them rizz your gyat! keep it up! 🥹🥹❤️‍🩹
"To be fair, stan culture was different then. If I was in a groupchat with Dan and Phil and they actually messaged me back in 2016, I would’ve shit my pants. Idk man it seems like it’s just a bunch of young kids who weren’t actually older teens in 2016, they just don’t understand how different the internet was then."
What even happened? 😮
ALL ABOARDDDD
🎶🕺🏼The TOXIC GOSSIP TRAIN ‼️🎶
Say what you want but she can sing
This song is a banger
Genius ❤
Colleen you still have people that love you! Please know that! ❤
So musically… this ate
i’m not giving any type of opinion or picking any sides.. but yall notice everybody getting “canceled” is from the same era of the internet? 😐
this made me giggle
Can’t imagine the people that don’t listen to you! You are shining!
I absolutely loved this.
why am i living lowkey
this song is lowkey fire tho
"For what it&#39;s worth Colleen, people who&#39;ve watched and loved you consistently for years will see that this is how you genuinely get your feelings out safely-you use music!! You always have! And anyone who has watched you consistently for years knows your heart, because you wear it on your sleeve. I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;ve been misinterpreted to a new generation. I hope you&#39;re able to get some pockets of peace soon."
"Colleen, I’m sorry you have to go through this nonsense.   😓<br>I still love you Colleen.  ❤<br>This all so ridiculous.  <br>I’m confused."
This on Spotify?
"If what she did was sooo terrible, then why have charges not been filed against her?  It&#39;s been, what, five years since this happened?  There has been PLENTY of time to get her in court.  That has not happened, why?  There is nothing here.  You think you have all this evidence with screenshots. There are two sides to a story.  Quit judging her without knowing all the facts.  Does she deserve to lose her job over this?  If so, why didn&#39;t that happen 3 to 5 years ago?  Why now???"
I love this 😂😂
"things will get better ❤, people make mistakes, &amp; sometimes things go over ppls heads , thanks for doing this"
Points for creativity
this is fucking great lol!
"People complaining this is not an apology, dude she did it 3 years ago..."
"I mean to be fair she did already apologize years ago. It just saddens me to see how people are so quick to attack when no one knows the full story or intentions of anyone. I just think, she has 3 beautiful babies at home that are probably sensing something is wrong with their momma. Everyone has a life outside of social media guys. Most of us don&#39;t even know the half of it."
You are an amazing person and please dont let these fucking no lifes ruin your life with something they dont know about you are an amazing person and made my childhood Amazing 🥰😍😍
You have been missed and are loved! ❤
Only seeing this although checking in frequently.<br>You are light! Be you ❤️
My prayers go out to you and the family Colleen 🙏
i just want to know how Applesauce is doing 🐔🥚🎭
Hi
GIRLSJDKDH
HE DIDNT SAYYY I COULDNT SINGGGG
This was perfect.
Stay strong ❤❤❤ You are a human at the end of the day and are allowed to grow
I love you Colleen! Hope you&#39;re well ❤️
THEYYYY DIDNT SAY I COULDNT SIIIING
No cuz why is the song actually fire💀😭
"Hear me out, she does make some good points. Nothing really to help her case because she never apologizes. And yes I know singing this song was probably the worst decision she made. but in the lyrics she does make some good points."
ok but the song kinda slapped.
Stay strong Colleen! I know you wont let them fanum tax your gyatt and ohio rizz you ❤
Don’t let the haters be Ohio rizz to you. Stay strong and keep going ❤
Iconic I love it
"Even if she does apologize, y&#39;all would still be on her ass just like a dozen other content creators out there who have tried to perfect and protect their image by &quot;taking accountability&quot; when in actuality you want them off the internet for good. don&#39;t try to play nice smh 😑"
My hero! Thank you for the song!
I’m so sorry you are going through this. We are all human and unfortunately you can’t take back what you did in the past.  These people have worse things they did and are trying to make themselves feel better by ruining someone’s life they don’t even know. Anyway happy to see you but sad for the reason❤
Yess collen! ❤
what
Such a banger
"yes girl. sending love your way, so happy to see your face 💕 please know you have so many adults out here seeing you and wishing you and your little family well."
Damn ok
y’all are weak i stg. this happened how long ago?? the fucking internet is a crazy place frfr y’all bashing on her isnt gonna do anything lmao keep doin u colleen. we &lt;3 u
BANGER ALERT!
Not gonna lie she sing better that the most singer i know
DELIVEREDDD VOCALS ❤❤
Low key a bop
Is this an ITYSL sketch?
PERIOD
Stay strong Colleen! We&#39;re here for you ❤
Stay strong and keep your head up high ❤
So glad to see you!!!  I have missed your vlogs!!! Praying for you!!! ❤
"This is tragic on both sides. Fans who got hurt and a performer who was monetized on YouTube and sold tickets with all these stage performances recorded and never said anything about it until now and the very thing ppl were entertained by is now evidence against them.. what does that make ppl who paid to  watch it, volunteered to be on stage? The whole thing is twisted on every side and sad and even worse forever connected to her name for her kids to see later.  Humans are a complicated creature and fame is fickle..  u can be entertainment until later its decided its perverse... I hope everyone can find healing on both sides eventually"
Yooooo she got bars tho!!! let’s gooooooo
"I haven&#39;t watched the video yet, but she has already spoken about this YEARS ago. Somehow, it resurfaced. Leave the poor lady alone. She&#39;s a great mom and is thriving."
Number 1 billboard coming
"Haters gonna hate and people gonna judge but lettt them girlll, if you guys don&#39;t want to se colleen then unsubscribe because I won&#39;t. We love you Colleen I understand there&#39;s small minded people out there living only to bring others down like they are perfect <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23get"">#get</a> a life , <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23loveyoucolleen"">#loveyouColleen</a>❤️"
🎵the toxic gossip train 🎵
"No cap, Im a little drunk and I could cry right now"
loved it. love you. miss you and your family so much!! ready for your regular content again
All I want to say is… all I NEED to say is….. 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗 I miss you
Loved you forever and always will!! you are 100% right
"This was genius. I love you, and I hope your vlogs come back soon ❤"
"Omg. Just leave her alone. No one needs thousands of people saying the same negative stuff about them. No human can handle this amount of hate. Let it go and mind your own business. She has three innocent children to be a mother to, and your words are not helping. She didn&#39;t commit a crime; otherwise, she would be convicted of one, but you all act like she raped or killed young children. Im not a Colleen super fan and I&#39;m not invested in this, but I&#39;m old enough to know that all this hate will just break Colleen and her family will be greatly impacted. If you Don&#39;t like her, unfollow her and take your negativity else where."
this made me cry
LMAOOOO
her vocals are actually very nice
"Although this might not be the best way to come back and apologize, if you actually listen to what she’s saying. She is saying sorry and she is apologizing. And although this is a little strange, and I don’t fully understand the situation. I feel like she went into detail and is actually trying to apologize and tell the truth. Y’all will just ignore and make jokes and not actually listen to her, and then call her out for being a bad person. Maybe listen, you might actually see that she is trying."
"Colleen, you’re a real person and this whole thing is such a non-issue for so many of us. I wouldn’t even address it at this point if I were you. You’re beyond all of this. You may lose a few followers in the short term. Let ‘em go. Your talent will give you new ones to replace them. So. Please stop all this nonsense - it’s beneath you to participate. I can’t wait for your next “normal” video… please don’t make us wait too long :) Saw you in St Albert with my niece and sister. We loved it. Your show is fantastic"
"I miss you. I know you&#39;re not doing well right now. Nobody would be thriving in your shoes. What you&#39;re going through is difficult AF. I feel like you probably aren&#39;t reading comments anymore because the hate really overpowers everything else right now, but I did want to break up some of the hate and judgement with positivity. I wonder if this pain is motivating you to be more creative, I know that&#39;s what happens to me. To me, you singing with your uke is genuine and very creative - you turned your pain into art. I don&#39;t like your lyric about you not surviving the crash though... you will survive this. It won&#39;t be easy, but you will survive this!<br><br>You are surviving this."
I was here before everyone else was.
"Alright, I personally think this was very well said. I do think that some specific addressing needs to be done but her message about taking the proof and receipts and adding to them to gain more views and ruin her reputation was LOUD and CLEAR. Also why does everything need to be shown on this platform?: To gain more views… it’s disgusting and unnecessary to have this drama out for the whole world to see."
😂😂😂😂
"I honestly feel bad because we all know whatever she dose to make up for it, it will never be enough for you guys I honestly believe her. She’s a human we all make mistakes even if they really really bad!! She only human after all let her live."
SUCH A BOP
Can everyone stop pretending they would forgive her if she did her video any other 9 ways she could have. 😂
"Well, she is undeniably talented..."
Oh Colleen :s
I love you Colleen!!! Hang in there ❤
You look annoyed angry and frustrated and I enjoyed watching that immensely. Good on you girl!  👍🏻😁 I like seeing this side of you.
"Everyone needs to sit down and take a second. If she would have sat there and made like a 25min video apologizing, you guys would call her a liar, say you don&#39;t care and say &quot;she&#39;s only responding because she got caught&quot;. If she never responded, you guys would say she&#39;s guilty. If she completely stuck up for herself, you guys would also say she&#39;s a liar and say that you&#39;ve already seen the facts. So now she gives you a response, not meant as an apology, just kind of saying &quot;don&#39;t believe everything you see&quot; because guess what, there&#39;s two sides to everything. I have been a fan for years, and yes what I have seen is really sickening and it makes me really sad, but I&#39;m not going to bash her before I&#39;ve even heard her side. This whole cancel culture shit is really fucking annoying, I swear people aren&#39;t even fans of her and are bashing on her. Chill tf out."
Please don’t stop your videos!!!😭
I liked your song ❤
Kinda legendary
ok
I don&#39;t like this mob mentality and ruining someone&#39;s life based on gossip. It&#39;s disgusting how weak and stupid the younger generation has become.
This is brilliant!
"Colleen, you&#39;re amazing. Sorry, you&#39;re going through this. The way you&#39;re responding to this nonsense has us (the fam) loving you all the more."
"I love you and your whole family, and I miss your videos! I&#39;m sorry for what you are going through, sorry. God bless you."
Just wow!!!😮
Ok but at least she said sorry
"colleen, I’m so sorry this happened to u. You don’t deserve this whatsoever. I love you girly stay strong❤."
Guess what everyone. It wouldn&#39;t have mattered how or what she said. It wouldn&#39;t have mattered if she apologized the way you or anyone else wanted. Shes absolutely correct. No one is going to care what she has to say. They wont believe it anyway. So why not do it however she damn well pleases
"Seems like people forget there are two sides to every story...<br>Whether you have a platform or not, NO ONE deserves the amount of hate both sides have received. <br>People can heal from trauma privately instead of making it the entire internet&#39;s business. Getting revenge &amp; trying to tear someone&#39;s life &amp; reputation apart from someone who hurt you DOESN&#39;T provide long term healing. Instant gratification, yes. But not healing. <br>If you&#39;ve suffered from any sort of trauma &amp; expect everyone to feel for you, yet you turn around &amp; hurt the person who hurt you back, you are just as guilty of the person who caused you harm. <br>Everyone is responsible for their own healing. <br>And everyone deserves to move on &amp; gain healing.<br>Leave Colleen alone.<br>Leave those affected by Colleen&#39;s mistakes alone.<br>Stick around for her content, or leave if she upsets you.<br>Just quit spreading hate.<br>And actually have the strength to walk away from what brings you down instead of arming yourselves with pitchforks.<br>Whether you&#39;ve made horrible mistakes or not, you deserve healing.<br>And you deserve peace. <br>But no one can give you peace.<br>That&#39;s YOUR responsibility. <br>Not anyone else&#39;s."
love u colleennnn
Girl let the haters back off please make more vlogs you make my day so much better watching your videos. I have pretty much all your videos. I hope you are doing okay you made mistakes but we are all human.
Iconic.
I’m so glad to see your beautiful face. I’ve missed you❤❤❤
ok why this lowkey ate…
"Please ignore all the bullshit and come back to YouTube , I miss watching you daily. 😢"
People saying this the worst apology this rlly isn’t an apology this is her explaining her point of view….
It says PG-13 on the website - so true what you are saying!
What do you guys want?! She literally said she didn&#39;t have any bad intentions!!! Come on she is a mother of 3...you are all ridiculous ppl behind a screen!!
You rock ❤
"this is the most disappointing comment section I&#39;ve ever seen lol y&#39;all gotta get outta here. internet culture is so weird. she&#39;s responding the only way she knows how, singing. Singing is her thing. Y&#39;all would&#39;ve said these things not matter how she resonded."
"I vote this the BEST APOLOGY VIDEO of all time, this is a future Youtube CLASSIC in real time... <br>But i&#39;m a sucker for musicals and i don&#39;t know what the fuck happened or care to find out beyond this video"
"Having just heard of her and not looking at all into the allegations, she sounds pretty reasonable.. sure, it&#39;s snarky and a non apology, but she&#39;s right.. cancel culture is BS.  Defining someone entirely by a mistake they made.. BUT cancel culture s the reality, so you have to deal with it."
"💖This is great! I was never a fan of Colleen but I&#39;m so glad Colleen made this video, it&#39;s perfect! Well done, for calling out the toxicity of all these chronically online bored people!"
"No one is perfect, we all make mistakes. You aren&#39;t evil for making mistakes, even really bad mistakes. Being 20, 25, 30 doesn&#39;t make you immune to mistakes."
YOOO THIS IS COLD DROP THIS ON STREAMING SERVICES
Best video of 2023
Love you Colleen. F the haterz
y’all fr needa hop off her back. She was just trying to be a good person.. like grow up and quit spreading bs lies. I’ve followed colleen for a good 7 years and she’s has been nothing but kind. So hop off her back and worry about your own damn problems
"I don’t understand why you are receiving backlash for posting this. Why people feel this wasn’t enough. I don’t understand why there is so much toxicity and hate. Anyone who really knows you would know you would never do the things they accuse you of doing. No matter what know there are those who stood by you and will continue to stand with you no matter what. Hate will not prevail! Thank you for posting this! Know that this will only solidify who you are as a person not define you, this will strengthen you and lead you forward. You got this Colleen!!! We love and support you!!!<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23stopthehate"">#Stopthehate</a>"
"There’s be little to no internet drama for so long, sorry you had to be the one that had to feed peoples desire for toxicity"
❤❤❤❤❤ You can survive this! You will survive this!! Context is everything. I missed you. Ignore the hate. It will disappear eventually. Ive missed your videos.
"BRAVA, BEAUTIFUL SOUL! I am sorry for the torment you are experiencing. <br><br>There are those who will never truly understand how harmful throwing horrible words like “p€%@“ around and others will suffer due to this. <br><br>Miranda is a character based on humor of the 90s and if people don’t understand her, that’s on them. Personally, it’s a genius character and I hope to see you on stage soon. <br><br>Thank you for this perfect reply. I look forward to seeing you vlog every day again. 💜"
I support you.❤️
Kinda iconic tho
I think you have addressed this and should just go back to doing your normal content now like nothing happened.   Don&#39;t read the comments.  The people who will watch will watch and eventually the attacks will subside.  There is no accountability that would be enough for the people who are angry.
Awe Colleen!! This is so sweet! I’m not sure what the rumors are exactly but keep your head high!
"look, fan from the get go, and always will be a fan,  I would personally would like to extend my friendship to you, really wish these things didn&#39;t happen, but it does, believe me when I say you will recover cause the reality is that you and all of us are human, this too shall pass. love you chica."
I’m sorry but this was gold
youn need to rrealease this song 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍love the runs
Ngl this kinda fire 🔥
I still love this song 🎶
your awesome
Incredibly disappointed in you. You had us all fooled that you were a good person. I guess this proves you are not. Sad.
This is very Colleen
Love this
"Ok I’m done. Leave Colleen alone. Everyone in entitled to their own opinions, I get that. Her Miranda character is supposed to make strange comments..THATS HER JOB. Her content is for adults. Anyways, the rumors are sad..if the rumors that are being spread didn’t come from her or you don’t have concrete proof that she did ANY of that..I’m with her. I have been watching Colleen for almost 4 years. So stop holding her to her past. NOBODY IS PERFECT. How would you like it if someone were to go and TEAR apart your past. Colleen, I am so sorry for these rumors that are not even being told as the truth. I truly love you and your content. Some people..aren’t meant for your content. I love you ❤️"
I mean song kinda slaps though
"These comments my god. Listen to her, it would be so easy to just say sorry and let it all blow over but she’s sticking to her truth and being strong in the path that she never did anything intentionally to hurt anyone. People are so mean and run with anything they hear, also that was then and this is now obviously we have ALL grown to know what is right and what is wrong. Back then so many things were accepted that aren’t now but we still drag things up from the past for absolutely no reason? These are real people with feelings in a messy situation it’s none of our business to determine who’s right and who’s wrong in this, they all need to move on and heal."
Hi<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Hi
Love u and miss u!
Not bad song though
I support you 100% Colleen!!!! I hope people will get past all these lies and things you &quot;did&quot; in the past and you can start posting again! This video made me want to cry with how hurt I know you feel. You are a comedian and make jokes. if there was a problem with a joke that was made in the past maybe people could of said something then instead of now with all the made up crap.
So glad to see you hopefully back! I completely have your back. I’ll be sending you a letter and some gifts for you and your kids soon. Love you and I’ve been praying for you every night. 💜💕🦋
She’s got some good points though…
I can see how hurt you are through this song - there is always three sides to every story - i have loved watching you and your family thankyou for sharing your life thus far
i love you
This made me cry
the song kinda slaps tho ngl…
"Oh girl, I just wanna hug you so bad right now.. stay strong 🤍🤍"
Y’all are so dramatic she’s not any of those bad things. LOVE HER
Love you Colleen.
It is sad how everything she’s worked for her life is crumbling down. People make mistakes and it sad that some are publicized
"Toxic Gossip Train, sounds Great.   Hope all is great."
"I genuinely do not understand why y’all are so angry at her? Humor (in her own way) is literally how she handles bad things?? Have y’all learned nothing over the past 15 years of seeing her??? I don’t get it, she’s very visibly hurt and trying to cope with it. Get over yourself"
She’s made an apology video years ago for all of this stuff. Why is it all coming to the forefront again? I applaud her for taking another route. Sure it’s cheesy but at least it’s something different.
😀
iconic
"i think she got her punishment for what people are saying. her career, as it was, is over.  we don&#39;t need to bully her into su*cidal thoughts. that is not right. just unsubscribe, stop watching and stop supporting if you really don&#39;t want her on youtube."
Love You! ❤
🫶🏻🫶🏻youre human queen
"Just wanted to let you know that the whole internet might be in rage about this song and the whole situation but you are still someone I look up to as a strong af and truly loving momma. I followed your vlogs for the past two years while I became a Mom myself, Never really commenting but now I felt the need to… because everyone deserves love and support as a human being and you might have screwed up in your online past but you do so much in your personal Life for your children and Family and that‘s worth so much if Not even more. You might not be welcomed back in the online community for a while but I wish you only the best and all the love from your close Family and friends and you as a Human being are okay Just the way you are - with all your flaws and mistakes. Cause let‘s Not forget: we‘ve all got them. Difference is, ours are not presented and talked about all around the world… best wishes and cuddle the kiddos - M. ❤"
i mean.. it’s catchy ig…
Colleen hasn’t used her music because she is trying not be disrespectful if you have watched her it’s how she gets her feelings out through her music! I’m so sorry people have a past but the only thing different between you and her is you don’t film your entire life so people can’t point out everything you did wrong!!!
"Don&#39;t get me wrong, she kinda ate the song HEAVY on kinda but I&#39;m not gonna say nothing bad. I&#39;m not like that"
Y’all aren’t listening to a word of this and it shows
"I will admit my bias because I’ve been watching Colleens YouTube videos for almost 6 years now for context I never really liked Miranda Sings. I’ve frankly never watched Miranda sings content unless it was for Colleen because I liked Colleen. I always loved their family’s channels and I watched Rachel, Colleen, and sometimes Chris. The whole Ballinger family that’s what I grew up with. Only recently had I started watching Colleens Vlogs less consistently Because I’ve been busy with college. However, when all of this came out about Colleen a few years ago, I remember believing the person that said it and when Colleen originally addressed it everyone universally came to the understanding that she had made a mistake. The irony is all of this drama that’s coming back up is it is the same thing that people tried to cancel her with years ago. Now, by no means, am I trying to justify any of her actions, but what I’m saying is for this video specifically, I appreciated the apology. I have grown up, feeling like I’ve known Colleen and known her personality, and she always turns to art when she doesn’t know how else to express herself. that’s some thing I quite liked about her because I end up doing the same thing in my personal life. The point I’m trying to make here is this apology is perfect for her in my opinion because this is an example of who Colleen is and how she deals with problems. I think it’s beautiful frankly, when an artist pours their heart into their work. I know some are saying that they would prefer for her to have been more professional in this video, but contrary to popular belief, when all of this came up years ago, she did address all of this and made a formal apology years ago. So now when people are bringing up the past again and trying to cancel her with the same old thing, I think this is a perfect way to respond and I understand if you disagree that’s all right. I could be wrong, and I could be blinded by my own nostalgia but it’s my opinion. Colleen if you happen to see this comment, just know that one of your fans has forgiven you, and still loves you.❤<br><br><br>Also, just bring a little bit more perspective into this. I really don’t appreciate you guys calling her a pedophile because I am a sexual assault victim. I was raped by a 30 year old man when I was six years old he was a pedophile. Colleen making a few out of taste jokes and weird comments does not make her a pedophile. Please don’t label people with such horrific terms when they haven’t done anything to deserve it."
points for creativity
why is this kind of a bop
I love you COLLEEEN💓 stay strong
Haters back off 👄
What do y’all want from this woman? She said she made a mistake😂 Honestly though what do y’all want her to do?
"Colleen I hope you’re doing ok. Just know you do have people out there who still want the best for you. You have made me laugh for years, gave me happiness as a depressed tween with no friends, helped others in their journeys to stardom, are accepting of the loser kids and gay kids and weird theater and art kids, outcasted kids, poured your heart into your work, prioritized your fans over your own health many times, you’re talented, and seemingly a wonderful mother, sister, daughter and wife. The way people have berated you, threatened you, and body shammed you over this is so vile and toxic. If the goal for this was accountability, all of those other things didn’t have to happen. This was a smear campaign. I don’t argue with there being inappropriate jokes made, I don’t want to diminish other people feelings about their experiences. This whole situation to me has been more about hurting and humiliating you and tearing apart your character with irreversible allegations that aren’t always presented in a truthful way. Calling someone’s groomer is a very serious and legally punishable thing and implies sexual abuse/relationships or other illegal activity with underage people. It’s not just talking to, joking, interacting with and being friendly with young people or every celebrity, Daily vlogger, YouTuber, Tiktoker, influencer would be considered a groomer. The YouTube community was really just beginning in 2012 and most of these YouTubers we know now had ever had experience on the platform or even much with the internet/social media altogether. MySpace was the first real “social media” and it was very common for larger accounts to communicate with ‘fans’ of all ages in groups and messages and pen pals with younger people like an older/younger sister type relationship. That was how this generation of YouTubers grew up on the internet. Having boundaries with internet followers wasn’t something they knew they needed until they blew up enough that they had probably already crossed the boundaries most have in place today. How are you supposed to know the limitations as an internet famous person if no one had ever been internet famous before? The jokes Colleen/Miranda have made are sometimes inappropriate or even bad taste but never with ill intent never with the intention to coerce, manipulate, or groom."
Honestly preach
"Colleen I know you wouldn’t see this but I wanted to spread some love with all this hate your getting. I believe you and understand what your saying. Your admitting to the things you have done and have admitted you didn’t think what you were doing was wrong at the time. No body is perfect and everyone is just trying in this world. You just wanted people/ your fans to like you and didn’t know the right way to go about it at the time. You were young and made mistakes we all do. Everyone who attends your shows and watch’s your videos need to understand what they are getting themselves into you have always made it clear what they are about and that it is inappropriate and all jokes. <br><br>I just want you to know that I support you,  love you and have missed seeing your videos because I think of you as my friend. I wish you all the best and hope you can still see the positive messages you are getting through the hate ❤❤❤"
kinda a jam tho
Fire song ngl
"So your telling me, she has been online for 15+ years and all the sudden these things start coming up? I mean ok believe what you want"
"Ya’ll can’t be mad that she didn’t apologize when you’d just make fun of her for that too. I don’t think you REALIZE how much things like this can ruin a persons life in almost every aspect. I’ve been a fan of Colleen’s for almost 10 years and have even met her. She’s genuinely the sweetest human I have ever met. She agreed that what she did in the past was weird and you have to keep in mind that she was very young herself when she started Miranda Sings. She has grown so much and learned so much, as we all do. Please think about how this is affecting her and her mental health. She has said all that she feels she wanted to or could to defend herself, it’s not right to make fun of her for defending herself. She’s not just some youtuber that everyone wants off the internet. She’s a wife and mother. Think not only about her, but her family."
"I mean... Tbh... I don&#39;t know much about the situation, but everything she says here seems extremely genuine. That&#39;s just my take on it. It seems like everyone is just shitting on her for just doing this in music form, when in reality, it&#39;s much mote genuine than 90% of any Youtuber&#39;s apology/explanation video."
Look y’all need to calm down 😂😂😂
"Not me in my head playing that office gif of Michael screaming “omg it’s happening, everybody calm down. CALM TF DOWN!!” 😂 But you have no idea how EXCITED I AM TO SEE AND HEAR YOUR VOICE QUEEN. It’s like that feeling when your friend has been grounded for 3 weeks and then they finally get to come back out and hang out with you again. Everything in your song is what your army has been saying all along. We love ya weird auntie, bff, cousin, sister, all the things you are to us 💞 Also, the ending literally made me throw my head back and cackle laugh. ILYSM ❤️‍🩹"
Guys YN she is a comedian it’s her job to make videos like this and try r thing with her sending stuff to fans she’s a comedian and like tf is she supposed to do idc what the internet is we’re all humans and if she did do bad stuff it’s in the future everyone makes mistakes and although people make bigger ones It’s sad to think of people who see her that way bc I still love Colleen
I’m kinda half and half on if Colleen allegations are real but one thing I do want to say is why didn’t she post this video on her main channel this channel has been like her safe place and she just introduced it to almost all of her haters and doesn’t she want more people to like know her opinion on this matter
thank you so much you are so brave
hello
Wow
I will say:<br><br>We don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening behind closed doors. We don&#39;t know how things played out. All we can do is trust our instincts that there are trustworthy people out there
It&#39;s sad that some people feel they need to put others down in order to get ahead. You are a kind and generous person Coleen. I enjoy watching your videos and seeing your beautiful family. Wishing you love and strength during this difficult time.
There have been some terrible comments on your video but just know your fans love you!❤
Honestly best response ever
"I know you guys are all against this style of apology video but honestly I like the unique take lol. She’s not entirely wrong with what she says in this..but yeah she was a loser with zero boundaries, let the women live jeez"
hi i guess
QUEEN
I would of made a video like this too. None of them really know you they can think what they want but only you know the truth there are real problems in the world and gossip is what their worried about don’t let them tear you down BACK OFF HATERS!!
Hahah this is awesome
Been thinking of you 🤍
"Idk…. I remember when she spoke about this somewhere a few years back, I like her attitude 🤷‍♀️"
nice song
Could&#39;ve just said this without the ukulele and singing...
"Jeez, all these people commenting, get over yourselves , leave her alone 🤍"
You obviously care a lot.
Yayyy!! She’s back
I&#39;ve been watching colleen and stopped but still sometimes watched her videos but if you people actually watched colleen and Miranda yall would know colleen anit like that cause now the Genz is so sensitive and snowflakes because 1 person did a mistake and all these things were back then in the 2010&#39;s and the humor and status were different then like people could take jokes and the thing with Adam if u watched the stream he SPECIFICALLY asked for the panties because she was unboxing random things and was giving it away and with the girl who was &quot;exposed&quot; on stage she wanted to get called up for the corn challenge but got called up for yoga and she could&#39;ve denied it and didn&#39;t go up but she did so its basically her fault for going on stage knowing her outfit was revealing and with the kid and cheeseballs he could&#39;ve said he didn&#39;t but that was all an innocent act u can hear the parents and children laughing in the crowd so all this is absolutely bogus because when something comes out and you realize colleen was right and innocent yall gonna look real dumb and if those people were victim&#39;s I&#39;m sorry but everyone should not be jumping on colleen like this cause yall loved her and now all of sudden hate her make it make sense because if you were a fan you&#39;d defend her and not accuse her so what is this like all these people are so invested in someone else&#39;s life and making a big deal out of it and now that technology is advanced there&#39;s things that can be fake and generated so yall shouldn&#39;t be riding colleen like its the toxic gossip train so yall really need to calm down with all this she made an apology and you guys are upset about it this is wildddd
YES COLLEEN I LOVE YOU FOR THIS I LITERALLY LOVE YOU SO MUCH MAN
I&#39;ve seen you grow and go to therapy and try to be a better person for the past few years and I wonder what people are really waiting for. Feels like they just want the end of your career and nothing else will satisfy them. I stand by you.
👑
🥴
Slayy
..she kinda right
Your family is what&#39;s most important 🩷
This is kind of catchy
I wish I could give you a big hug right now. :(
your not wrong
IDC YOU SLAYEDT
"None of you actually know her as a person, and only listen to what lies are going on online"
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"I reckon just go back to posting vlogs, those that will be there will be there."
I hate cancel culture so much😩 she’s corny but she’s not a bad person… i don’t understand why people today feel so entitled and feel like the world owes them something. Every vid that came out about her was such a fucking reach.
Missed you so much. I love you Colleen.🫶🏼
Seriously NOT a loser! And definitely NOT a groomer!
I love you
Stay strong queen. We know who you are. You will get through these lies. Love you so much ❤️❤️
They’re things wrong that’s happened. Say sorry. You really need to say sorry. No your not a horrible person. You’re an awesome person actually
dont worry colleen this happened to Haley Bieber and now everyone is in her comments saying they love her after bullying her relentlessly just wait for the light at the end of the tunnel ❤❤
"Colleen I’m so sorry this is happening to you,you are a beautiful wife,incredible mother and these are the things l see,bless you,🙏❤️🙏❤️"
"I completely unrelated to what was going on remembered watching Miranda sings and your personal blogs back around 2015 and I remembered how much your content made my loser days a little bit better dealing with the hell hole that was public middle school. Thank you for sharing your life and thoughts online, it made me feel less alone then and it does now. We carry on with our heads up ❤"
Everyone is just picking this apart without actually listening and thinking about what was said. Which kind of is her whole point with the video. People want to pick apart every little thing and not actually put things in perspective. She did admit her mistakes and feels awful about it. But people only want to see the bad and can’t look through one side of things
"everyone&#39;s making fun of her for &quot;singing an apology&quot;.. but honestly, if you just read the lyrics as it is, it makes lotsa sense.<br>.<br>all i can say is.. who am i to judge 😳"
"Colleen, it will pass, you just have to wait"
I miss you. You are a positive vibe
I love the song
"I love that this is her response. People are blowing this out of proportion. Enough with cancel culture! She apologized years ago… get the fuck over it! <br>There are real criminals out there and you are canceling a woman who apologized for this in the past, supports kids with cancer every year on her birthday, makes lighthearted videos about her sweet family. Give me a break! Y’all need therapy."
"I&#39;m trying to understand this timeline of events...<br>Three years ago she was accused of inappropriate contact with underage fans. One in particular came out and made a video. She took accountability and apologized for her inappropriate choices and has grown and changed since then. <br>Meanwhile the person who made a video was doxed, bullied and harassed.<br>Now more corroborating evidence about her inappropriate contact has come to light and people want her to apologize again? I don&#39;t understand that. She has already apologized. If anything it&#39;s the people who bullied that one person who came out with the allegations that should apologize. <br><br>I think that maybe singing this wasn&#39;t the best move, but she is a human and people are emotional and flawed and that&#39;s kinda ok. I don&#39;t know what glowing saint person you want to see on here, but I always felt like she was honest about her missteps and mistakes and took strides to learn from them.<br><br>I&#39;m 40 and it would kill me if people still judged me based on who I was 15 years ago. Anyways. That&#39;s my two cents."
"I am so sorry Colleen you are going through this. It must be really hard. You are a mom, a wife, a sister, a daughter, a niece, etc. At the end of the day we all mean well. There&#39;s so much stuff and I really hope one day you vlog. I have always enjoyed seeing your videos and vlog about your life."
Haha. the Internet is so cool.
"what she’s saying low key makes sense, y’all don’t want her to apologize you want her off the internet for good, and probably wouldn’t be happy unless she was put in jail. any apology she could make wouldn’t satisfy people. Glancing at you @penguinz0 ."
"You guys don&#39;t understand, she took accountability... in private. Which explains why the fans that called her out with screenshots, powerpoint presentations, video clips, written accounts with a timeline ... never referenced this &#39;accountability&#39;. Because it was in private.<br><br>I bet you all feel silly. Not silly enough to go against your managing team that apparently told Colleen to not respond at all [wonder why that is]. And certainly not silly enough to pick up a uke and construct a song that seems more practiced than an apology directly to the people who brought this to light to begin with.<br><br>I bet you all feel very silly."
You are a star ⭐️ and you shine ✨ as bright as day
"colleen, i have been watching you for 10 years and i have not been on social media for the past 5 years (other than youtube) because i just realized that life can be lived without it. i have seen a lot of what has been said on youtube, and to me  i completely understand that you did not recognize in the moment that you were crossing boundaries because you really do make your viewers feel like we are your friend and that is what we love you for. i can also see that you recognize now that it was doing harm to some and you want to make it right. just regardless of what is happening on the internet, remember that in the end you are a great person and have an amazing family who love and support you, and your kids have an amazing mom that they are looking up to. love you girl 🫶🏼"
This just looks like a mental breakdown to me imagine having millions of people express their opinion on you on a daily basis it’s going to get to you which it clearly has her
"Even if all the gossip were true, you&#39;re still not a bad person and deserve some basic respect. I feel so bad for all of the unwarranted distain aimed your way. Hang in there, I hope you have some support around you, you will always have me as a fan at least."
"I pray you are not in agony right now, because we all know how hard you take things and how much you overthink. There are still people out here who love you Colleen. I&#39;m praying for you and your family. Everything will come out in the wash. Stay strong and please eat something ❤"
and don&#39;t forget nothing is all white or all black... and this is true for everybody
❤️ 💕 💗
obsessed!!!!!!!!
WE LOVE YOU ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤Hope Youre okay ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Yes! Get MAD!! More people love you than hate you! ❤ F*** the trolls!!!
"She is completely true, people have made rumours about stuff she has done. Yes, she has made mistakes, but that was in her past, we all have made mistakes in our past. Being mean and saying things that are not nice will not fix anything. She has children now, she would never do anything like that, stop making up lies. If you believe those lies and don’t like what she ‘did’. Then leave. She is trying to make videos doing what she currently loves, we know her intention, she is simply trying to make us happy. Showing us her lives, her kids growing up, giggling, laughing, singing, living her life. Just because she is famous does not mean people should be angry at her. If you haven’t made a mistake on your life then there must be something wrong with you. And if you made a mistake years ago, how would you feel to have millions of people going after you, saying mean things, making up lies. Be real people, think how you would feel and start being real! Now if you don’t like Colleen anymore, leave. That is fine with her I am sure, probably better. Go."
This is genuinely a good song tho😂
this is so slay
Since I’m with God I’ma forgive u💕
❤ hi
Thank you Colleen I have never seen anyone handle this cancel culture with more honesty and grace you are an inspiration ❤
"Seeing your face on my feed today just made my little girl&#39;s entire summer. We love and miss you so much, Colleen. <br>Stay strong!"
I LOVE YOU ❤
I missed you Colleen 🫶🏽
❤❤❤
"All this hate is so unnecessary, i hate this woke generation."
she has apologized multiple times and you guys aren’t satisfied so this is the best she can do to satisfy all parties. Love you Colleen stay strong 🫶🫶🫶
Always take your time!
I love you so much. ❤
Why’d everyone just start coming at her 😪 but I love her singing voice tho it’s actually good 😺
always will love you
you ate this girl ❤
"People, are you serious! This is something that happened years ago when she was just learning about the YouTube world. I don’t personally know Colleen but I feel like I have been her best friend for years. everyone learns, grows, and MATURES over time why are y’all trying to hold this over her head so hard. If anyone has ever really watched her videos and paid attention to the kind, sweet, loving, caring personality that shines from her beautiful soul y’all would see and understand that yeah she made a mistake years ago but is not that person anymore you will see and understand that she has grown so much and only says and does with the best intentions to her knowledge. No matter what kind of hate your getting online Colleen, your true fans, like me, will always be on your side to lift you up when needed. Love you and your amazing family! ❤"
I hope ur doin good Collen 💕 i literally love Miranda and i hope she comes back soon 💕
Test
Where are the lyrics?
"You guys are all so fucking brutal. She made MANY mistakes. She was inappropriate, but I believe in my heart she didn’t try to groom children. Like it’s a stretch. She’s unwell clearly; and y’all wanna see her suffer until she’s gone for good. So fucked up this cancel culture. How did James Charles survive but Coleen got lit right up?"
"i have never in my life expected colleen to ever be attacked and harassed like this or “canceled” ever ever ever. everyone is making fun of her for making a song out of the situation but if you actually knew her, she’s a singer, she sings for EVERYTHING, that’s who she is. she’s always made songs for everything. her actual, genuine, supporters know this. im not trying to account for her mistakes, but she is addressing it in the way she felt most comfortable. idk, i have been supporting her for more than 10 years and still love her, she’s a good person. with a huge heart. who has made mistakes. but so has the rest of the world."
COLLEEN I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUUU. FUCK THESE PEOPLE. YOU CANT SAY IT SO I WILL. FUCK EM. KEEP DOING YOU AND MAKING PEOPLE LIKE ME SMILE AND HAPPY ! I lOVE YOU SO MUCH.
I have been around since the Josh era. I have essentially grown up WITH u...im 36. I do know theres a huge difference from what we SEE on youtube vs &quot;real life&quot;. But i have watched u go thru so much. We have been pregnant together. Cried together. U have cried far more than i have lol but when Flynn was born i balled my eyes out. When u posted ur pregnancy announcements and ur old house tour after u bought ur new home i cried with u. Most recently the death of ur chickens. U cant FAKE being a good person. We all make really shitty mistakes. When i first heard about this drama i started watching one of those videos and i stopped almost immediately. I just wanted to know what was happening. I simply didnt believe and i still dont that u harmed anyone intentionally. I hope u make it thru cuz u are one of the only people i still watch faithfully and it breaks my heart. Mostly cuz i feel like i know u and i know how much this is hurting u. I can only imagine the anxiety and stress this is causing. Ur poor fingers must be worn raw. Chin up friend. ❤
Genius
I hope you&#39;re ok Colleen! Been a fan since the start and saw/met you at your shows. You are always so lovely and kind to your fans. Its so upsetting to see you like this! And I hate the cancel culture thats picking up so much more these days. I wish people wouldn&#39;t spread fake rumours. Get the truth before kicking off!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I can’t believe you’re back. Please don’t ever leave YouTube. We love you Colleen ❤
courage girl .. courage .. you rock
I believe that she didn&#39;t have any bad intentions I mean she did some weird stuff but I don&#39;t believe that by heart she&#39;s bad person
We love you ❤
"Love you, girl be strong! People can make mistakes and people doesn’t have to be literally so cruel for it. I never read the comments but boyy people are mean. I actually think that their making mistakes. Whatever happens i support you! ❤❤"
am i the only one who thinks its decent
"Cancel culture sucks! Everyone makes dumb mistakes in their lives. Unfortunately, for people well known, it ends up being smeared everywhere. Yes, she made a few silly mistakes but it was very clear she was never &quot;grooming&quot; Adam and didn&#39;t have any sexual interest in him whatsoever. The only people that can throw a dagger in Colleen&#39;s direction are those who have never made a stupid mistake before and I&#39;m sorry to burst your bubble but that&#39;s no one!!"
I LOVE YOU
Y is this kinda good
"Colleen, sending you and your family so much love. The internet has really shown what a nasty place it can be here recently. <br>I know you are a kind, compassionate woman and mama. I hope your family and friends are wrapping you in love and support in this time.<br>We’re all human and it seems so many people have forgotten that. I hope to see you in this space in some capacity in the future but if not, I’m wishing you the best.❤"
Stay strong colleen! People just dont understand❤❤❤❤
COMING TO SPOTIFY WHEN!?!<br><br>Also here’s a frog 🐸
"Colleen i’ve been watching you since elementary school, I’m 25 now and i still completely and utterly support you. I think you are an amazing soul and you’ve always made me laugh and smile with your content. You will always have true supporters and fans like me that will stand beside you! Never give up, you have a beautiful family and a beautiful life that you’ve worked your ass off for. You should be proud of all you’ve accomplished and i wish you the very best always. ❤️❤️❤️"
I believe you... My past was pretty blah...<br>I miss you and your videos!
"I honestly don&#39;t believe colleen would do that I can see the miranda persona being strange at points, but she isn&#39;t a pedophile."
colleen. just keep on keeping on in spite of the storm. float above the noise. embrace the turbulence
Love you Colleen. So sorry you are going through this
"I mean we all gotta calm down. She chose to expose herself but no one is perfect. I really think she’s changed, people change and try to be better. We should all try and be better than yesterday, seriously who are we to judge people by their past??"
colleen u slayed this
Hey..don&#39;t believe any of the mean comments...I believe you and everyone make mistakes...I hope you keep posting videos soon 😊
Omg I know she mad some mistakes but she regrets her mistakes and she didn’t mean anything bad by it. I love Colleen and I miss her daily vlogs with the chickens and tortilla talk and everything she did in her vlogs. I wish you guys would stop being mean and here her side of the story.
"y’all clearly didn’t watch this video through and are just paying attention to the singing part, listen to the words, she’s genuinely sorry"
"I support you Colleen, people do make mistakes"
Let’s be honest… no matter what she said or did in this video she was going to get ripped apart for it anyway. All everyone wants to do is cancel her anyway without realizing people change.
Ngl she would be great in a play 😭
So glad to see you hopefully back! I completely have your back. I’ll be sending you a letter and some gifts for you and your kids soon. Love you and I’ve been praying for you every night. 💜💕🦋
I support you and am here for you.... Stop pandering to this weak-minded woke mentality.
"i loved this, i’m so over cancel culture. Ppl are overreacting for sure"
Colleen just hang in there people do make mistakes ❤
"Colleen, you are an absolutely amazing human being period and I adore you for this! I&#39;m so glad you spoke out about this stupid toxicity on the internet!!"
Guys she sang the song because it looks like she couldn’t get the words out otherwise. She’s clearly distraught and doesn’t deserve this. Nobody is perfect but we’re not on show for the world.
"For what it&#39;s worth, I do not think you&#39;re malicious."
No one is perfect. All of the allegations are from 10+ years ago. Move on and mind your own business.   I don’t think she owes everyone on the internet an apology. The only apology owed is to the ones that what has happened proteins to. So for the love of all that is good get off her back and find someone worse to attack
lol everyone in this comment section is mad because she called you out for having nothing better to do with your lives than dig up stuff people did YEARS ago and hold it against them
i love u colleen
I have been so worried about you. I may get attacked for this but I believe you didn&#39;t have any bad intentions and we are all human and I don&#39;t think you deserve all this. I may get attacked but idc i still love you
what she did was not ok but maybe the only way she can apologize is through music. so instead of being mad at the apologized through a ukulele be grateful that she apologize at all
Love you so much and always will!
Absolutely brilliant !!!
Bro y’all thought all the shit she was doing years ago was funny but now everyone’s upset bc we live in a social media world of cancel culture… y’all are wack 😂
I love you Colleen. The internet is a scary place and I can’t imagine having it has my job. I have missed seeing you and the kids. Stay strong
"I love you colleen, I don&#39;t care about what people are saying, you are amazing and keep your head up high gurl. ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
"Yall are really just looking for someone on the internet to be upset with.. go get involved in your local communities and get mad at the people/politicians who are actually hurting humanity. No one should be this distraught by an internet personality who, in the grand scheme of life, isn&#39;t really a monster."
"No apology would be good enough for them. Good for you for not putting up with this. All of these allegations were already dealt with 3 years ago and you apologized. People need to move on. People make mistakes, people change and you’re real fans will be here when you get back"
This is amazing I love you Colleen ❤
YESSSS
The “fuck me right” at the end hurt bc Colleen you are my childhood and ilysm so don’t give up ❤😢
I LOVE YOU FOR THIS
"Look, I understand that there have been more than small mistakes made in the past and that Colleen should take a little more accountability for that. However, as she said, people make mistakes at the end of the day, and I don&#39;t think it is on the public to constantly scrutinise her about it.<br><br>If you don&#39;t like it, simply don&#39;t watch. <br><br>Her actions with fans in the past went over the line; however, that doesn&#39;t mean that she is a terrible mother; I have watched her vlogs since she got pregnant with the twins and didn&#39;t have any doubt about her love and devotion for them. Sure, they are displayed in videos, but what person online doesn&#39;t do that? It&#39;s not only her, and it&#39;s something to look back at for memories.<br><br>Again I say if you dislike it, don&#39;t watch it. I will never understand how people think that it is ok to harass others. She is well aware of her mistakes and leaving harassing comments won&#39;t change that."
Well this was iconic! Everyone wanted her to speak and there you go 🤷‍♀️...I like her.
Good for you for talking and defending yiurself!<br>Love you so much PERIOD.
I love you so much and i will always support you you help me through so much.❤
were all human!! I still love you
I LOVE THIS IM SORRY COLEEEN!
honestly the most real response to drama iv ever seen. always here for you for colleen! ❤
"At the very beginning of collen&#39;s yt career, she has been sharing with us how introvert, shy,loner  little girl or even up to now she is. This yt thing and popularity is not even her intention why she is making yt videos up until now. So if we come and think of it, she is not used to having a lot of attention from anyone. We should all be understanding and give everyone a chance to grow from their mistakes. Our generation is far different from their&#39;s, it is nice to see that young people are making a change, but we should not shame anyone for making something wrong especially if it&#39;s the past and that person is trying to have a life and change for the better."
"I love you, although the singing wasn’t the right way to approach it I’m on your side."
I keep singing this song in my head i love it
You need to read THESE comments and not the HATERS comments!<br>They are just making videos for views and clout.
"i’m reading comments and some of you definitely came here to just hate. she said her team do not want her to speak about it, they never said she can’t sing it. she obviously wants to say her part, but her team is stopping it, which is why she turned it into a song. i’m not justifying what she has done, or what others in this situation have done, but you all seem to pick and choose what you want to hear."
Awww hugs 😢❤
I missed u Colleen stay strong!!!!!♥️
Brave and Strong.
i love this Colleen hope you come back !
sending positive thoughts your way.  You will get through this difficult time with the support of your family..
This is the best response ever.<br>I miss your vlogs so much and i hope you are coming back!
I actually love this song!
I still Love YOU ❤
"Love you, Colleen!  ❤"
I miss you Colleen!
Colleen I know it’s hard to ignore the internet trolls. No one is perfect and everyone makes mistakes. I know you left this in the past and pray the bullying can stop. You are a great mother and wife and this too shall pass! Sending prayers! ❤
IDK WHAT YALL SAYING SHE ATE
I love you colleen
Y’all are just hating still no matter how she presented an apology or explanation. You consent to going to her shows watching her and continue to do so so
stop why did u eat
I love you so much and this song
if people dont like you thats on them and it doesnt matter if they dont because there are still people who love you
Coleen i support you ❤ Don&#39;t let these bullies try and make lies about you.
"Ignore everyone, keep doing your thing"
Don&#39;t let anyone shit on you.  Great singing voice.  Subscribed
"Just do you, turn off comments and keep posting"
im with you
"Honestly, 10/10 song"
I&#39;VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH😭😭😭😭
"Colleen did take accountability for what happened in the past and explaining the show is PG-13. Apparently everyone is tone deaf because she is explaining everything she has done was wrong and how she fucked up. I’m not making a excuses for her because honestly she is a great person, but shit everyone does wrong especially really hurting people. Nobody is perfect. She is not manipulating no one."
I still luv you Colleen🫶🫶
"Look around you Colleen, there is more support for you than you think. Supporters aren’t as loud as the jealous zealots. Look after yourself and your family first. ❤"
Hey Colleen. This is just a moment and it may feel like torture that it will never go away. Focus on your family and yourself. This too shall past.
❤
this is actually kind of awesome
I&#39;ve missed your beautiful face I&#39;m so sorry you are going through this! People can be so heartless 💔  I hope to see you back 🙏
I still love her fr
"not her saying exactly what y’all would say, everyone makes mistakes &amp; if you are attacking her for her past.. u are bored with your own life."
This slaps
"People suck, its ok. Keep your head up"
Sending so much love ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"She has some good points but she is a mom so I do think she is going through it. I’m so sorry Colleen, hopefully you take time for your mental health, and you have been on the internet for so many years so a break is good for you. And I hope you do reach out to the people that felt abused in this situation. The internet is a scary place but hope everyone gets there peace. ❤"
Is nobody realizing all this stuff that she “did” was in the past. EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES!!!!!!!!
I love you Colleen. I miss you videos I watched every single one since before Flynn was born. I hope you come back.
hi.
"even if she would cried and fell to the floor and said sorry a million times y’all would of still said “ she’s gaslighting us” she is still a horrible person” and she every possible thing to keep on just HATING, she’s changed and either way little kids shouldn’t be in her shows since u can clearly tell her character is for older audiences NOT 7-8 yrs olds!! so if the parents take them to her show they shouldn’t get mad since everything she does is part of her ACT"
Omg she made some mistakes in her past. I bet everyone who is calling her namea never made mistakes to and haven’t taken accountability for it. Think as if this is happening to you won’t be funny if it did. Leave her alone
"I don&#39;t know the entire story with what kind of messages she sent to fans. But what I do know is it was forever ago. There&#39;s way worse well-known people still out there. Idk why this apology is hated when she could have listen to her team and not acknowledged anything, but she felt as if she needed to. She&#39;s come so far from where she started, she helps more then she&#39;s &quot;hurt&quot; since then. Like she said people say things and everyone feels like they want to be part of something by hating her. Your not just hurting her but the family she&#39;s grown and the loved ones that have to see her in distress. It&#39;s really sad, and I&#39;m not trying to validate anything that she has done. But I&#39;m sure u guys have forgiven friends and family that&#39;s done more then just text people trying to be funny in an inappropriate way. Sorry ur going through this love, I hope u come out on the other side and u have the strength to carry on despite. The internet is a cruel maze of funhouse mirrors. It&#39;s hard to navigate when everything so distorted. But it&#39;s easy to follow somebody else&#39;s lead when they think they know what&#39;s real. Just carry on and you&#39;ll find ur way out of this mess. 🩷🩶You still have fans🩷🩶"
Colleen you don’t need to apologize. Anyone that thinks you’ve done something horrible I can bet if we looked through that persons phone they too could have something taken out of context. I would think people would be very careful with accusations now say as we know a lawsuit will punish those that are lying. Im so sorry Colleen ❤
She still ate!!
🤟
"colleen, the ones who know, know. I love you"
I cried on seeing you! I love you Colleen and always will.. Your vlogs helped me so much during my rough days! Thank you for all of it. ❤
❤❤I Still Love You ❤❤always will and I miss seeing you on
colleen I still love you!!! please stay positive
She doesn’t need to apologize that dude took that information and ran with it clout…just get over it… I don’t believe anything that anyone says about her or her family…
I FUCKING TOOK HOURS TO READ EVERY FUCKING ASS COMMENT AND 99% OF THEM WERE HATE COMMENTS AND THAT JUST MADE ME CRY
"You can&#39;t change the past, but you can do better moving forward"
You will never be terrible.<br>You have changed!
"Hi Colleen❤️ and who ever else will read this! <br>I am so glad you made this video and I think you need it to. I have always been a silent fan. I rarely comment, but I watch every single one of your videos not exaggerating. I started watching what other people were saying about you and I began to question if it was true, but then I would see some wild things. For example, one creator made a video about you, and he had never even watched you assuming you are a family vlogger when you have said, explicitly you are not. Videos of your past of you saying not so kind things have resurfaced. What irritates me is people refuse to see your growth and the fact that you are an advocate for so many people. You are a best friend to strangers on the Internet who need you when they have nobody else, you’re a mom who reminds other moms that they are strong too, you have have mental health issues and advocate for the fans you love to accept their mental health issues as well and everybody who watches you knows they’re not alone. What people fail to realize is that your fan following is not a cult, we are people who have made mistakes too and admire your willingness to grow as a person and learn new things about life that you once didn’t know. You teach others to open their minds, just as you have learned to. Please never quit posting.

I missed you! I know music is your way of coping. Keep your head up!
Okay slay I love you colleen
👏👏👏 i love this response
Team colleen❤❤❤❤❤
low key worked on me
I love this ❤️ you are a beautiful person inside and out. ❤❤
"i love u and i will always will❤ u shouldnt have to apologize again, your amazing im sorry ur going through this again bb, u dont deserve this"
Literally could not have responded in any better way
This might not be the way to handle it BUT FOR ONCE YOU ARE STICKING UP FOR YOURSELF  and being YOU! Good for you!
😍😍😍😍😍😍
"Honestly I LOVE THIS I always have these thoughts when old videos or things resurface of celebrities from 10+ years ago. Like,,, tell me YOURE still the same person you were back then.  Oh youve changed??? Yeah, so have they. <br><br>You go Colleen!!!  You’re the only one that’s actually explaining, and being serious, instead of crying and just saying sorry."
"You are a bright spot in my days and an astoundingly beautiful soul. I’m so happy to see your face again, girl. Sending all the positive vibes in the world to you. Hope they wrap around you like a blanket. Rest. Breathe deeply. Tomorrow is a new day, and there are millions of people who love you and stand in your corner. Actual millions! Let that sink in. You are so incredibly loved…for exactly who you are. <br><br>You’ve got this ❤❤❤"
Honestly she’s so real and true for this
You’ve changed my mind! 💛
Colllllleeeeeennn I freaking love the crap out of you... this makes me sad that your sad I hateeeee it...
"All the comments about &quot;this is a terrible apology, this is not an apology.&quot; NO, IT&#39;S NOT MEANT TO BE. She&#39;s standing up against cancel culture.  It&#39;s the bravest move she&#39;s ever made.  Good on her."
"I have no idea what’s going on here, but…my heart! This was a great video. I love the words and the music. It’s all so good.  I hope you get through whatever you’re going through ❤"
I love you so much. Always have always will
Colleen. I love you so much.<br>What you did was wrong BUT a you HAVE CHANGED!!<br>I’m Amman from your Thousand Oaks show.<br>You are amazing and I will always appreciate you.
People are going to criticize your response no matter how you say it. I think this was a perfect representation of who you are and I’m so proud of you for finally standing up for yourself. Those of us that watch you religiously have seen you grow as a person and know who you are to your core- a good person who may have made some mistakes in the past… JUST LIKE THE REST OF US. love you forever queen 💜💜💜
Love you Colleen
"y’all are so annoying. she’s a person too. anything can be screenshotted and take out of context. she could have handled the situation better but she is right, she has changed her ways. and she is openly admitting that it wasn’t appropriate to say to her fans. if this was a man, everyone would be over this within a day. y’all are so bored with your own lives that you involve yourselves in someone else’s."
"I’m so sorry this is happening to you right now ❤ Please take care of yourself 💕 Things will get better. Your babies need you to be happy, healthy, and strong. Unfortunately the internet sucks and people jump on the hate train. Just remember that you have a ton of amazing people in your life that love you and know the real you. Just focus on the beauty in your life and let the negativity wash away. Sending positive vibes to you and yours❤"
"Idc what people say, I still fully support, things have been twisted"
this is so smart
nice
Oh.😇
"I wouldn&#39;t listen to all the bull crap that they were posting.  I have been waiting for you to come back knowing it would take a bit.  Hang in there.  Sorry, this is happening.  Hope your family is doing alright and I hope you are alright as well."
"I love colleen, I grew up watching her. I don’t think she is a groomer or predator. She has always been my favorite person, I like that she has made this into a song, I get bored watching people apologize for 30 minutes and not mean a thing. She has turned this accountability and song into something else that will take the pain away for her and makes it a little light hearted. She has talked to her fans, but a lot of tubers call their fans their “best friends” and Colleen actually made initiative to talk to them. I see where she is coming from with that, Colleen is just the aunt that is trying to be there for the kids so they have someone safe to talk to. I love and support Colleen❤ always have and always will."
this was a slay
"I&#39;m literally balling I&#39;m so sorry colleen, I love you no matter what"
I’m standing here with you Colleen! 🫶🏻
Guys she made a video taking accountability when this was brought up YEARS AGO.
❤
COLLEEN I LOVE YOU
This is perfect i love you Colleen sending you love and hugs 🫂💌
Why do people bring up stuff that happened in her past. This is clearly not what she is doing now. I am sure many of us have done or said things in our past that we don&#39;t do now. Would you like others to keep holding your mistakes against you?
Colleen I love you so much I honestly don’t understand why people keep bringing this up after you already addressed it so many times and it’s in the past so that’s where it should stay love you girly it was so good to see your face again❤
stay strong ❤❤❤❤❤
The cancel culture bullshit needs to stop. She&#39;s only human at the end of the day. People make mistakes. You shouldn&#39;t have to answer to haters. Appaled at people&#39;s judgement. 2020 and onwards the years of cancel culture. Ridiculous.
She ate this
"Colleen, I LOVE YOU!!! I’ve never commented on a YouTube video EVER, but I have followed you for almost 10 years and you deserve SUPPORT!🤍🤍🤍 You are a hardworking, passionate person who is devoted to connecting with her fans. People grow and change, and if there’s anyone who recognizes that and takes accounts for it on social media it’s YOU, queen! It’s wrong for people to tear your life apart over a silly mistake and lies. I stand with you and you haven’t lost a fan here🤍"
I missed Colleen!
Thank you for standing up for yourself and not giving into bullies.  Your fans are proud of you! ❤❤❤❤
I love you Colleen I’m sorry about this ❤
Ive missed you!!
"Colleeeeennn, I’VE BEEN SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU. <br><br>my heart is with you.  And I believe in you."
"I know you&#39;re a good person . People just need something or someone to bitch about. I&#39;ve been watching you since 2019, and you showed nothing, but being a nice person and a great Mom❤"
I feel so bad for her 😢
Colleen stay strong people make mistakes and thats ok. Love u and its good to see u again on our screens we&#39;ve missed u
Love you Colleen ❤️
The fact that you can here that she is trying not to cry talking about this is what you need to here she is taking accountability and realizing her actions she hasn’t done them in the longest time and that was never her freaking intention so if you’ve been a fan for a long time you should know that.
❤️
"I feel so bad for her. Can’t even interact with fans without people trying to make it out to be something it clearly wasn’t. But low lives &amp; weirdos on the internet don’t care about the facts. They’ll make up shit &amp; just run with it. Y’all need to go touch grass, &amp; stop starting rumors like middle schoolers. We get it, your life is miserable &amp; pathetic, but you don’t have to put that misery onto others 💯"
People are just hating for more views!<br>We all love you 🥰
I hope you see this comment and know that I’m completely on your side for this. Everything being said is so ridiculous! Bunch of lies and rumors. <br><br>Rooting for you Colleen🩷🩷🩷🩷
Love you.
"Colleen I will always love you for the laughter, the chance to spend time with your beautiful family who also brought me lots of laughter &amp; joy.  You are a human just like me &amp; everyone else.  We are all accountable when we reach the age of adulthood to take accountability for ourself &amp; seek help, recognize it &amp; apologize. You did all those years thing.  Others should do that too!  I will always love you Colleen because when you know better, you did better.  Everything will be ok.  Love the beautiful family you were blessed  with.  If you chose not to come back online I will miss you dearly.  God loves you.  So does your family.  It will be OKAY hugs"
I’m proud of you Colleen and hey I miss you so much
"It&#39;s so so obvious that you guys aren&#39;t even watching this video. Please LISTEN to her, please listen to this video. It isn&#39;t just a song, she&#39;s addressing and taking accountability for her actions. She&#39;s giving you WHAT YOU WANT!"
Walk away move forward in life every one love colleen family kids husband are number one vlogs
I do not care. Just keep putting out content. Let that beautiful voice sing.
❤️
I’ve missed seeing you. I know ur not but hope you’re keeping ok. Sending love and support to you xx❤xx
You’ll never win with the internet trolls. It really is so reflective of THEM and NOT YOU that they are destroying everything you have built for your family. Keep on keeping on girl. ❤️❤️
Went onstage with you Thoysand Oaks (Amman)<br>And I will ALWAYS love you because…<br>YOU HAVE CHANGED YOU QUEEN.<br>YOU NEED 20K TIARAS AND CROWNS 👑 <br><br>LOVE YOU LIKE THE WORLD BESTIE.
So sad…. I don’t believe the crap they are saying about you….. the world turned to shit because of the internet….
I’m only three minutes into this at the moment and Colleen speaking to you as a mom and have been watching you for a very long time. I just want to give you a hug and to let you know that you are loved. And I respect the hell out of you and I think you’re truly an absolutely amazing person and I’m sorry that you’re going through this.
Colleen...hugs to you and your family...your great and such a wonderful mom and wife and friend...now I only know you by watching your videos and things...but your such a sweet talented woman...thank you for making us smile and happy..this will pass...just hold on to your loved ones and stay strong....I am truly sorry people are mean and how people are so quick to judge..I loved to see that you posted...I have been hoping to see you soon...love u take care and love yourself and enjoy your friends and family❤
"Colleen if you see this, I see you and I hear you. I am so sorry you&#39;re hurting and that your safe place turned violent. This will die down. You will survive this &quot;crash&quot; and those that love and care about you will be there for you as you land. <br>P!nk&#39;s song &quot;Turbulence&quot; is one of my favourite songs right now, I hope you listen to it on repeat. &quot;When it hits, don&#39;t forget as scary as it gets It&#39;s just turbulence...&quot; One hell of a M*th** F**king bought of turbulence, and it may feel like the plane is going to crash...it&#39;s just turbulence...this too shall pass. Also a really good song for any anxiety sufferer btw. <br>❤❤❤"
glad you&#39;re back  I&#39;ve been worried about you!
very well said.
❤
You still have fans that love and support you.
"We love you Colleen, all of the people saying these things are just chronically online teenagers who overanalyse and want to hurt good people❤️"
DONT LISTEN TO THEM COLLEEN I LOVE YOU ❤❤❤❤❤
Don’t worry Colleen your gonna get through this keep strong and don’t listen to the negativity social media is a toxic and horrible place keep your head up
"Couldn’t listen because the format is pretty cringey, but read the transcript and think there is validity to the commentary (and some clever turn of phrase)."
"I hope you’re doing okay, I’ve been a fan for years and know how hard all of this has been on you. Remember that some people still love and support you. Cancel culture will do anything to get somebody down until it moves on to the next person. Keep yourself and those babies safe and healthy ❤️❤️"
Colleen I’m so happy you’re back. I’ve missed you. Behind a comedian is hard now and I just want you to know I’m always by your side. I’ve watched you for 10 years and I’ve seen SO MUCH WONDERFUL GROWTH IN YOU. keep on loving yourself
Don’t let the little bitter people dull your light. It’s jealousy on a next level.
sending support and love your way! &lt;3
I can’t wait for this all to end. I miss your vlogs and want it to go back to normal!!!
We ALL make mistakes ❤
"Good for you!! I love this very much. No matter what you say, how you say it, when to say it. Good for you Colleen"
"Not everyone believes the ugly stuff!!! Not anyone in this world is free from life mistakes! I know it doesn’t feel like it, but this will pass and the haters will move onto the next victim!!! I know it feels like it, but you aren’t alone! I know you may never see this, but I hope somehow you feel those of us wishing you good things and believing in you! ❤"
"Don&#39;t worry girl, I love you😢"
I love you so much Colleen! You&#39;re so strong and I love that you have made it this far without giving up. Be you and stay amazing!
Like get it queen!
💜💜💜💜
Good for you Colleen!!! This BS will die down eventually.  💕
"I Hounestly wish people could really see what she’s saying like she’s gone a strange way about it but it draws attention to a valid point , if everyone was world famous on the internet for most their life, there would be things from everyones past that could be dug up to cancel them , people are so quick to be vile on the Internet and it adds up , all hate and facism is wrong but poorly made jokes in a time where no one called people out for these things dosnt mean these celebrity’s need to kill themselves to equal justice"
"Spot on. Cancel culture is so dumb, just a bunch of people getting high on hating together😂 <br><br>I truly enjoy your content as one of the last youtubers that still dares to share as much as you do. And as an awkward person myself, its so sad and scary how people gang up and prescribe intent behind other peoples actions, and defense seems futile =\<br><br>I hope that hate wont win this time❤"
"leave her alone. <br>this should be discussed and dealt with her lawyers/agent she doesn’t need to apologize to anyone, we all make mistakes and we are all humans. nobody is perfect. <br>stop commenting nasty comments on her video, that isn’t good for her mental health and you don’t know what that can do to her."
COLLEEN I LOVE YOU EVEN MORE! Keep it up! I agree!!!
"Colleen. I feel you. I  am shook at how little people research their gossip. We know you. We love you. Forget all these trolls. They will be gone soon enough from your comments. And we, your fans will still be here. ❤❤"
Omg Colleen I freaking love u so damn much. Know that I stick up for u everywhere and I’m sure im not the only one. I’m so glad u r back. I am so so damn sorry u r going through this. U r the best person ever imo. Ppl ruin every and anything good… omg I’m so damn sorry Colleen. I can’t imagine what this feels like
"Colleen I will stand in front, behind you, to your left and right and above. I&#39;ve really missed you."
Colleen pls know I’m still here to support you. You will get through this. ⭐️🩷⭐️🩷⭐️🩷⭐️🩷⭐️
"I believe you did nothing wrong Colleen. You may have been naive perhaps, but you’ve earned your successes and deserve to be heard. It’s so unfair what is happening to you with people who haven’t followed or known you making those decisions. Those of us who have know you would never intentionally hurt or use people. Chin up Colleen. Some of us still love and adore you."
I love you colleen miss the vlogs like I miss a dear friend.
"Didn&#39;t she play a ukulele in some other videos? I have watched on and off for years and I remember her doing that at some point, maybe about haters or pregnancy or something like that.. i can&#39;t remember."
Don’t pay attention to any of these haters! I absolutely loved the song and agree with the words in it! It was so nice to see your face! Stay strong! You know the real fans and the real people who aren’t herd followers support you and wish you the best! <br>Waiting for you to come back and miss your vlogs! ❤
Haters back off!!!!
Omg colleen we love  you so much and ignore what they are saying if they are lies. And I know you love to volg so do what you love and we understand that you made mistakes but you have grown so much. Any way I miss you and your kids and chickens and hearing about your life. I love you  so much and I hope this helps
"Love this. People are bored. You got this. People are bored with their lives and just tryna fit in. You will always have support from me and you loyal fans. Everyone messes up in life, if people brought up with I did 10 years ago I would also be cancelled. Everyone would. So much love to you and your family ❤❤❤❤"
❤
"You guys are really tearing this human to shreds. Yes she made mistakes. Like she was saying we all have! The only difference is hers are on display for the world to see. She’s still a HUMAN. You never know what someone is going through. Do you really want to be her OR ANYONES 13th reason? Yes she is playing victim. Because she is a victim!! From everyone’s attacks online telling her horrible horrible things you would never wish on yourself. Colleen, I’m praying for you. Despite the wrongs, I know you’re not a “bad person”"
❤
this is the besttttttt.
Um I have no words at this point. Idk all that happened and I feel that we shouldn’t judge what happened bc we don’t rly know all that happened.
I love you Colleen omg
Keep your head up girl.. all of this is a reach…
"I am so sorry you are caught up in this toxic energy that is floating around right now, and it is just making me so sad for you and your beautiful family. Love and Light and Healing Energy to you all."
❤
You are so loved ❤
I misss u … don’t let them win!!!
Y’all really got nothing better to do. If I see the word victim one more time I’m gonna puke. Grow up. Get a life. Leave the girl alone.<br><br>Hang tight Coleen. The world is your oyster and they want the pearl you hold. Everyone just looking for a cash out. Re route. Re focus. 💜💜
"we all wanted for you to post anything, we all missed you and love you… you true fans and the people that can use their critical thinking❤️ You don’t deserve and it is sad that today’s reality is NOT based on facts but perception🫠 i love you, always have always will❤️"
No bc she is actually making a point and you people are saying it is cringy when she&#39;s trying to apologize even tho she did nothing wrong
OK SONG WRITER!!!
"Judge not lest ye be judged. Yes she has done stuff in her past that she will never do again, everyone has done stuff they regret in their lives, the only difference is ours isn&#39;t online for all to see, so we can hide ours. Colleen I hope you will read this, because I see you need some support, for someone to listen to your words, and accept them, and move on from this toxicity. I know people will not agree with my supporting you. I don&#39;t care. Colleen you have a beautiful heart, your kind, you are human ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
Try to hang in there Colleen! There are a lot of people who have watched you for years and can see both sides and know your heart. You’ve already apologized for this years ago and have changed your behavior. It’s not fair that it’s blown up like this. Come back when you’re ready ❤and your true fans will be here waiting.
Idc what y’all say she ate
i forgive you miranda<br>Hope it gets better
💕💕💕💕💕
Colleen is a really good person at heart and I know she would never do anything that was meant to hurt anyone or offend anyone! Everyone makes mistakes and they usually learn from them! I love you Colleen❤ Please keep posting and be strong for your mental health and kids and family and supports that love you!!!
"I teared up when I saw you had posted! ❤ My mind is not changed about you. Not your video and not any of the s**t I&#39;ve seen in the last few weeks. You are just a human like everyone of us. Careing, loveing, funny, smart, strong.. With and without mistakes... I&#39;m so so so sorry you have to go through this! Sending love and hugs your way.  Stay strong, Colleen. You don&#39;t deserve this..❤❤❤"
I Honestly don&#39;t know certain people anymore. None of us are perfect. Leave her alone. Are you fffff perfect.
I don&#39;t like commenting on videos but YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT I MISS UR CUTE LITTLE VLOGS &lt;3 everyone needs to just touch some grass
"this is the best response to anything i&#39;ve ever seen. i am obsessed with this response LMAO i love you so fuckin much dude i am ,laughing so hard at these comments"
"Colleen I know there is coming to be a loot of hate comments on here but I hope you see this one: I will never judge anyone on their past even if it was bad, people can and will make mistakes but people can also change. I know it’s not a tun there ARE people including me that actually care about you and won’t believe anything bad people will say about you. I am so glad you made this video because I was so worried about you and just know to take as much time as you need. I love you Colleen you did nothing wrong in my eyes ❤️❤️❤️ and the only ones that really matter is your family and people who actually care about you. Don’t apologize to people who won’t except it. Love ya 🫶🏻"
Stay strong❤
"PSA FOR EVERYONE COMMENTING<br>if you don’t like her, if you think she is a bad person. Then why are you watching this vid? I hope you all know commenting and watching this video is MAKING HER MONEY AND PAYING HER BILLS."
I LOVE YOU COLLEENNN THIS WAS AMAZING !
Love you Colleen! Please hang in there.
yes you are a human and we all make mistakes. I&#39;m seeing you in boise so im excited &lt;3
So happy to see this from you. You need to keep posting because that is the only way to reclaim this narrative. Things got as out of control as they did because you were too quiet. I love you Colleen. Please be well and take care of yourself
I love you ❤
❤❤❤❤
i love you forever colleen im not even going to try to figure out why you got cancelled or why you&#39;re apologizing but i love you and thats all that matters i dont care what your past has to tell us.
"I just wanted you to know although i wasnt there for this guys claim days and havent really watched miranda, i have watch you throughout all three kids and enjoy your channel. I cant see the side of you they are trying to put out and even so i can tell even if some parts you admitted were mistakes and you owned up to it. You are only human colleen. You are not who you were and even then i do not think you were like they are trying to insinuate: people grow and learn at any rate and you are no difference and do not deserve to be torn apart. Pleas do not let them destroy you and although its hard when it seems like everyone is against you- they arent. Im not and i do not think you are horrible. I dont know what happened in the past but it is the past. One thing i know is you have three beautiful children that need their mommy. Show them your strength and how you persevere through troubled times. Please keep your head up."
"Colleen, you seem really genuine and sweet. Our world has nothing better to do than get power by tearing people down. Its other peoples insecurities that cause them to reach so far for anything to hurt someone. Keep your head up doll, I may be some faceless words on a screen but the joy you bring by just being you has helped my anxiety and depression, I am sure I am not the only one. Keep bringing your light to the world. You are impactful in the most positive way. ❤❤❤"
Keep going Colleen I believe in you still
EVIL PEOPLE IN THE COMMENTS! DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR AND DONT WATCH HER  AND KEEP IT MOVING! UNSUBSCRIBE AND WATCH WHO YOU LIKE! SO MANY NASTY PEOPLE ON HERE!
Gosh I love her for this ❤❤❤
"To the people who are attacking her “ grow the hell up”, it’s not her fault. She just wanted to connect with her fans, and to the people who feel “trauma”, you shouldn’t have responded or even dm’ed her . To the people who feel “trauma” grow the hell up and admit you shouldn’t have done that like a crazy fan. This cancel culture’s is the stupidest thing ever. Why can’t people make mistakes like what humans are supposed to do. To the people who don’t make mistakes, your parents must of had y’all on a chain and the belt in there hand."
stay strong!
Love you !
This is 10 minutes of spitting facts 💯 <br>where is the song available on spotify? I wanna listen over and over again. I love you Colleen.

❤
y’all cut her some slack pls 😭 she made some mistakes but haven’t we all omfg. y’all are talking about stuff that happened years ago AND had NOTHING to do with most of you 😭😭 y’all saying hurtful things is just as bad. she’s not a bad person and you can tell her intentions weren’t bad either. accept the apology and move on. find something positive to obsess over pls 😭😭
Colleen we all are here for you the things they are saying about you is awful and bang out of order and it’s not fair to you but we love you girl and your amazing xxxxx❤❤❤
"Love you, believe you."
"Hey colleen, please try and remember that people are always quick to share negativity and the ones who are seeing this whole situation for what it is are just a lot less likely to show support. But they do support you. Keep fighting x"
You can all be mad idc but I agree with Collen with everything she sings in this. You should really look into yourselves...are you all perfect? Some of you should put all this energy into your own lives and your environment.
"Colleen, stay strong, you have fans and always will, i have always stuck by your side, and i will keep doing it as i find everything very weird and unbelievable, people are so so mean, people make mistakes, and terrible ones , but like you said, you changed. I hope you come back soon, i miss you and your family ♥️♥️"
I’m on ur side girl u got tgis
"Colleen, I&#39;ll always support you i&#39;m not disappointed in you or mad at you i love you🥰"
Poor girl wish I could give her a big hug

"Hey<br>Just wanted to say everything’s gonna be okay soon.❤People,well mostly children who are dramatizing this situation will just forget about this in a week or two like it always happens. Idk maybe some things were true but how i see it  just some people trying to get views and make some money and of course get attention with making you look bad🤦‍♀️<br>Hope you’re being strong and won’t give up cuz I’m still waiting for those everyday vlogs, Miss you💕"
People make mistakes.
Team Colleen 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
I mean she has a point.
I stand by Colleen lol
got ur back colleen idc ❤️ people nowadays are so desperate for online drama to try and make their boring lives more interesting
"Hi Colleen, I don&#39;t know what happend this past couple of days/weeks, but I hope you know that people who cares about you are out there. Take care &lt;3"
I have always seen some hate comments and felt very sorry for the creator who is receiving the message but this is infuriating me. i have watched you since i was very very young and i know you think a lot about what you put on the internet and you are always very careful. i do not believe these rumors are true and i love you! stay strong❤️
"❤Colleen, I really hope you&#39;ll see this among all the bullshit. I&#39;ve been watching you forever and don&#39;t give a flying f about the alleged &quot;proof&quot; or &quot;screenshots&quot; - you could never do what these morons are accusing you of, and anyone with a brain can see that. Wish you strength and hope one day you will look back and feel grateful for the experience that made you even stronger. Sending love ❤"
"I love Colleen and I stand by her. I know she did already made a video and explained. When people tries to get clouts by destroying others reputation, that is when I draw the line. <br>She made her mistakes, she did account for them years ago but the need if some to get their 15 min of fame, and likes, and new subscribers under slander and messing up someone&#39;s life, carreer and mental health... I cannot agree. I will continue to support her. <br>Colleen, I senserely hope that you are getting mental help that you need at this moment. Be safe 🙌🏻💪🏻 be strong!!"
Keep making videos my love were with you f the ones that ain’t
🥰
"You take a whole bunch of mistakes over many years and call her a bad person… we all have made mistakes. Colleen is so kind hearted and would never intentionally hurt another. She has apologized and explained herself over and over for these things over time… enough is enough. Colleen is right that it’s all for clout and views. If you don’t like Colleen, please leave. This was a special place for the rest of us before all this."
she didn&#39;t deserve this :(
Honestly you ate queen
F*@! them little trolls!  You rock!! ❤
HIIIII IM YOUR BIGGEST FAN IGNORE THESE AWFUL PEOPLE THAT ARE MAKING RUMORSS🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼
i love you colleen
WOW🤩
"At this point you have nothing to hate about your just halting on mistakes everyone learns from and makes. Making a song and apologizing  and explaining yourself is super smart and mabye easier for coolen, give her a break please. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone has a heart and feelings.❤ sending love to you coolen and the person who is reading this"
💗💖💞❤
"I don’t think you’re a bad person at all. I had tears in my eyes listening to your song, and I am so sad you’re going through this. I truly feel like you said it perfectly, in that people are just having fun trying to ruin you. The comments on this video continue to prove that. I support you, and I don’t believe these false accusations. People make mistakes, including the ones trying to hurt you. ❤you!"
"i honestly think this is a fair apology, people communicate their emotions in different ways, this was hers<br>she took apology and said what she did was wrong and she didn’t understand that<br>and for the rest, she can’t necessarily just take accountability for smth she didn’t do LMAO"
❤❤❤
"Colleen, I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;re going through this. I know people are going to think you&#39;re mocking, but I see the pain in your face and your voice. You know you can&#39;t convince anybody so you do what you do best during a hard time. I&#39;m still standing by you as a 33 year old mama who has always loved COLLEEN! I was never here for miranda, always you!"
"Oh sweetie,  I hate that you&#39;re going through such a hard time,  the world would be a perfect place if there were no people in it,  but sadly we have to put up with the crap things wordishes out,  I wish I could put my arms around you and take away the pain,  I&#39;m a Nana who loves your videos and your family,  you just do what you do best,  keep moving forward ❤️"
"As a long time viewer of Colleen, music is therapy to her and she’s made a bunch of ‘reading mean comments’ video on her channel and I think that’s the idea and vibe she went for. It backfired because people judged her based on this one video (instead of analysing/ knowing her behaviour for years as a subscriber) and a narcissistic boy on the internet (who gets way less views on his personal content lol). <br>Anyway, we have all made mistakes in life as humans, they may not be as public as celebrities go through. Forgive don’t forget and continue living life! The sooner you get out of your bubble of ‘life should be fair’, it isn’t so move on.<br>Glad you’re back Colleen ❤"
Its ok we forgive you 😢
"We came to your Indianapolis show, it was amazing! The kids (5 &amp; 3) had the best time. You are so strong for being able to perform &amp; put a happy face on when terrible people are trying to destroy your life. Stay strong girlie, this won’t last forever! Thank you for not canceling your shows!!"
Idc I love her ❤😊
Love Colleen!
"I enjoyed the song and it is built to the brim with truths about our society. A lot of people, from my experience, likes to formulate a thought based on information they learned without grabbing the concept that all information received isn&#39;t 100% revealed. As time progresses, incremental information will be discovered if the individual is vigilant and ready to absorb the information they are oblivious of noticing from their previous experience. Most people, like myself, prefer not to wait and would rather be noticed now versus being noticed some time in the future. People who put contemplative thought with the content they create (e.g. books, movies, etc.) release their media weeks, months, and maybe a year before they release their content for public viewing; yet people without the experience of being patient and will reply based on their current life situation and hopefully learn from their actions if it is a mistake. Their are two common phrases I&#39;m feeling is relatable with my perception trying to gain fame and/or notoriety (clout): &quot;players going to play&quot; and &quot;any publicity is good publicity&quot;."
People these days are never happy and find a problem with everything she has a good point and everything she said is valid
Colleen I love you so much I&#39;ve been watching you for years and to be fair it feels like we&#39;re friends (not in a weird way) I hope you come back I miss the vlogs. People will always hate but there&#39;s a point where they take it too far 😕
"Poor girl. I know everyone has their opinions, but I understand where she is comming from and no one should feel alone. I love you colleen❤"
We love you so much Colleen! Some people have very different opinions. But some people will still love you! Stay strong! We all make mistakes. ❤❤
💜💜💜💜💜
I miss you Colleen. I am so so sorry you are going through this.  I support you 100% and KNOW that you are a wonderful human in the line of toxic fire ... it&#39;s so unfair.
❤️
Love you girl. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re unapologetic because you didn&#39;t do anything wrong.  Don&#39;t let people&#39;s perceptions of your past dictate your present or future xx
"I love you darling, stay safe please"
literally ur the best
I thought I&#39;d check in and make a funny observation. Since I posted this video based on something a Daily Wire host said NONE of them have really mentioned the idea that Dylan is a comic genius. Why? Because they will never give anyone on the &quot;LEFT&quot; side credit for being clever or smart.
One person made more people stop drinking then AA has for 88 years.
This will go down in history as a &quot;not knowing who your target audience is&quot; event
The most expensive beer commercial of all time
Dylan Mulvaney stopped more alcoholics than prohibition 😂
The face that brought down an empire.
As a gay man this shit makes me wanna date real women again.
"In 50 seconds Dylan managed to offend men, women, and lose a company billions of dollars.<br>Very impressive."
Thank you Dylan for making many people realize they were drinking piss water
"Who on earth thought &quot;this is the way to boost our sales, use the person that 99%of our customers hate as a spokesperson&quot;? Great marketing"
"How to destroy a beer company. Dylan, “hold my beer”."
I’ve never met a woman that acted that way
How to lose your company $27 billion in 50 seconds.
I had to see the straw that broke the camels back 😂
Bro single handily destroyed a billion dollar company 😂
Mixing booze with hormone blockers? Dylan’s erratic behavior actually makes a lot of sense now
"25 billion dollar commercial, that also caused more people to stop drinking than all the treatment centers and AA combined. Unbelievable, what were they thinking?! 😂"
"This dude went from a long way from dumb videos to taking down a entire corporation, its impressive actually."
I asked my mom who doesn’t care for basketball what March Madness was and she said college basketball 😂 You did this to yourselves Budweiser.
Bud…. The queen of beers
"It’s not about trans hate. It’s about making the world realize that an imaginary gender change isn’t an achievement. It’s not worthy of anything, especially brand endorsement that put money in your pocket. People need to understand that changing your gender doesn’t make you special and you can’t force the world to comply."
49 seconds. Efficient destruction.
"Marketing Exec:  “Hey I have an idea, let’s give our core customer base the middle finger.”<br>CEO:  “Hmm?  What’s that?  Sure, whatever.  I’m busy golfing.”"
Leaving aside all the Dylan controversy... How can someone promote a beer for Marchmadness not knowing what that is or even what sport it&#39;s for? This ad looks like a HS project for a marketing class :/
Thanks to this man I have finally stayed sober for weeks and quit my addiction
"I’m not Bud Light’s target audience (as I think this stuff tastes like toilet water, and when I want to drink beer it’s not as a substitute for water), but I have friends / workers I’ve employed who are.  Let me tell you about the people who drink this stuff by the gallon. They drive Dodge Ram pickup trucks, motorcycles, watch sports as if it’s going out of style, wake up at 5 AM to go fishing, etc.  What were they thinking?  Wow!!!"
every time you watch a video of this guy it’s like a submitted audition tape. What a world we live in
Pass the Coors..
Let this be a lesson to multi million dollar companies. Don&#39;t let a hated person endorse your product.
This ad was definitely not made by bud light drinkers😂😂😂
Well there goes bud light 💀
"The Marketing Executive genius that commissioned this is now working on an advert for pilgrimage to Mecca starring some bacon farmers. Inclusivity matters, folks."
The fact that they doubled down by insulting women&#39;s knowledge of sports. 🤦🏻
"Bud light is undrinkable, once you get use to craft beers bud light taste like pothole water"
God that face is the same face my cat makes when i pick him up by the scruff of his neck
I got sober in 2009 but I started drinking again just so I could drink something else.
"Did anyone even take the time to test this in front of a test audience?  it’s stupid, insulting, cringey, nauseating."
The video that SINGLE HANDEDLY killed an entire corporation. 😂
even my wife who watches no sports at all knows what march madness is
Sometimes I regret leaving America…then I see this and remind myself I made the right decision 😂
Every alcoholic in my family has quit drinking thank you and Anheuser Busch
Can anyone say &quot;it&#39;s Miller time!&quot;? 🤣
Dude is making fun of women and that&#39;s the person they want on their beers. That&#39;s fucking hilarious.
Never drinking  this beer again😔
"Now it is official, the Americans have gone bonkers. Greetings from Holland."
Drank Budweiser for decades..no more
"I love the complete hilarity of this whole thing. So this commercial is the two of you &quot;celebrating&quot; him being a trans for 1 year, okay..?? And he doesn&#39;t even look like he is enjoying the beer, or even drinking it. And the look of his face on the beer can is something special, like even if you knew nothing about this whole situation, his face being like that on the can is extremely unappealing. And his whole &quot;go sports&quot; and his complete disconnected spiel of &quot;go enjoy...whatever it is you&#39;re doing. lol. all that matters is i&#39;m getting this sponsorship. So make sure to buy more beer with my face on it!&quot;.<br><br>I feel like this whole scenario is born out of a GTA game. The hilarity of it all is too surreal. How could ANYONE at Bud ever thought this was a good idea?"
"I felt a great disturbance in the force, as if millions of pot bellied middle aged white American males suddenly cried out in anger.- Obi Wan"
Gays and trans have been drinking bud light for years and yall mad now? 😂
"As Al Bundy said, &quot;Pretty women make us buy beer; ugly women make us drink beer.&quot;<br>In the case of Bud light, it looks like neither of these will happen that much now.<br>What a &quot;genius&quot; marketing move . . ."
"Please be the spokesperson for Monster energy, Fortnite and Vaping :)"
&quot;Bud light!  F--- that s---!  PABST BLUE RIBBON!&quot;  <br><br>-Frank Booth
"Budweiser might as well have licked every Bud Light can in America and said, “here, enjoy”."
Epic Fail for Bud Light. What the hell were they thinking?
I was very sceptical about social media influencers actually having any influence on consumers but in this case it seems to be working. After 20 consecutive years Bud Light is no longer the best selling beer in the US.
"So... Are people boycotting just because she&#39;s trans? &quot;We can&#39;t have no fake girls drinkin&#39; our beer, herp derp&quot; lol"
Demonic
Who in the marketing department thought this was a good idea 😂
This is what made conservatives so butt hurt lmao
"The damage one little twerp, can cause, is amazing!"
This is a generation raised by Disney
"Correct me if I am wrong. Anorexia, Schizophrenia both are said to have delusional characteristics &amp; have a place in the DSM 5. But a man with male parts but thinks &quot;he&quot; is a woman is not seen as delusional?"
"Love the sound of empty cans,"
"This man, I mean woman has quite the superpower taking down big corporations"
This is what has all the republicans crying over 😂🤣
"It’s time to boycott bigotry, and people that are homophobic and transphobic.   Get over it."
Haha loving watching Bud fail all the way from Australia.<br>- Adult human female 👌🏽
"&quot;Hi. My name is Dylan, and I&#39;m here to ruin your business.&quot; 😂"
Man we live in an absolute crazy world. Years ago this person would be in a padded room and today we put there face on beer.
I know all them exec&#39;s at A.B. are over there with the warm &quot;bout to shit yourself&quot; gut feeling losing all that money and careers.😂😂😂
Two takeaways from the Dylan Disaster:<br>1. Real men don&#39;t party with fake ladies.<br>2. Real men don&#39;t drink light beer.
"Bud should have stuck with the Clydesdale horses.  Those ads were endearing and left everyone feeling good.<br>This new ad is not only poorly written/acted, it did not target the groups who spent their dollars endorsing the product.  What the hell were they thinking???"
If I was a woman I’d be very offended. He’s making a mockery of them implying they’re a bunch of airheads that don’t know what March madness is or what sport it would be tied to. Taking the stereotypes to their unrealistic extremes
"My god , what a world… I have two kids, for crying out loud…"
"Oh boi, this will be taught in marketing classes on how NOT to run an ad campaign. At least this company will be remembered for something."
"Didn&#39;t bud have &quot;real men of genius&quot; commercials?? Bring those dudes back, we all need new beer inspired inventions for the tech world."
How many Bud Lights would you need to get excited for  Dylan?
The guy in the commercial be littled sports fans and Bud Light drinkers. Looked creepy too.
"The fact that he’s counting the number of days he’s been in ‘womanhood’ 😂 I’ve never heard a women need to say this, because, they are women. They don’t need to justify it. Get this dude some help."
Imagine being the person who brings down an empire in just 50 seconds xD
What I’ve learned: If you dress up as and act out stereotypes of a group of people you can get your mug on a beer can and it’s completely acceptable.<br><br>Following the same concept; if I paint myself black and act out black American stereotypes that’ll be completely acceptable and I too would get massive support and my face on a beer can.😜<br><br>This is the world we live in; everything is okay now. To all of the woke-minded people or “insert pronouns here” out there. 🎉 Congratulations you’re a “winner”!
It costed $400 million dollars to make this ad.....
"Bud light: “we need an idea that will connect with or main demographic, hard working middle age MEN”<br>Also Bud Light: this garbage"
"Lol Bud totally deserves all of this, god damn"
"This was almost hard to find unedited or without commentary, thanks for posting"
why is this thing still alive????
The biggest decline in drinking since prohibition.
"ive been struggling to find the original ad, thank you"
That literally took a lot of balls
Most expensive ad of all time <br>😂😂😂
"Buttweiser, King of Queers!"
I can’t believe someone at Budweiser thought this was a good idea.
I always love seeing people trying so hard to advertise me a product that can be consumed and yet in that advertisement they just barely drink (or eat) from said product.
"A commercial that will live on in infamy. Gotta go, it’s Miller time."
RIP Spuds Mackenzie
Holy shit my friends told me about this commercial. I laughed about it and kept on. I just watched it. My brother walked out and handed me an IPA with a bud light in his hand. Might be a sign.
More powerful than a AA meeting 😂
"Worse mistake, a beer company could make"
I saw a Bud Light delivery truck and someone had spray painted across the back &quot;I brake for chicks with dick&#39;s&quot; 😂
The face that sank 1000 bottles of beer...
Bud light gave all new meaning to pounding a tall boy 🤣
"I swear, people can&#39;t take a joke anymore."
I will never drink BUD again .
30 billion dollars commercial 😂😂😂
"By just making this commercial, this man not only got people to quit their alcohol addiction, but also this man even crashed a big corporation that used to make billions of dollars.<br>Edit: Edit"
this makes me want to rethink my life
This is what got yall&#39;s panties in a bunch? 😂 Not even a minute long
"I mean, seriously, even if you gave no issue with Trans, this is a terrible ad campaign. <br><br>So tone def to the market too"
<b>HOW TO RUIN A REPUTATION 101</b>
It takes balls to do this video
"Thank you for posting this. Some people were offended by this ad and others not. The people who are not offended by the ad were offended by bud light not standing behind their decision to make this ad.<br><br>The end result is Bud Light ticked everyone off. They could’ve done a stronger ad in support of LGBT issues, however, the ad doesn’t appear to strongly address that either."
Bro doesn’t even know march madness is about basketball but tries to act relatable
Wait... this was the commercial that everyone was so upset about? There is like... nothing scandalous about this.
How Fake do you want to be?<br>Dylan: Yes!
"NGL, this ad was so much tamer than I expected given the backlash 😂"
How can you in fact MAKE a Bud LIGHT? I mean the original Bud tastes like water... adding water to water is STILL just water...
And now so many are facing the unemployment line.
It&#39;s straight liquor from here on out!
What did they think was going to happen???<br>They insulted their consumer base!
"Everything else aside, I resent being called Fratty and out of touch. Miller Light is actually pretty good! 😋 I’m done with AB products."
"I don&#39;t see why there was so much commotion about this commercial.  I would guess everyone is so sensitive and defensive and easily loses their cool.<br>Not everyone is a sports fan but that&#39;s no reason to make a big deal.  Back in the day people knew not to go off the deep end over a little humor.  I get it, it&#39;s not intentional disrespect and so you shouldn&#39;t take your sports too religiously.  Lighten up.  I don&#39;t even take religion religiously, but I take beer important and celebrate all the time like her.  FYI, actually giving it up, for now at least.  ✌️💙"
49 seconds to destroy a shitty beer empire.
Good to see the world hasn’t gone completely insane
I honestly thought this was an SCTV parity. I did not think they were serious.
"Wow, giving middle fingers to all basketball fans while dividing half of your customers. Even Thanos couldn’t do that"
This add would have cost next to nothing to make. But didnt it cost them millions 🤣🤣
"This is a guy just putting on a dress and being like &quot;Women be petty and ignorant AF, yo!&quot;<br>It&#39;s really misogynist.   And actually traditional."
"wait i don&#39;t get it, I saw Millers and it was stupid as hell but can someone explain to me what&#39;s wrong with this one? (Also guys don&#39;t flame me but I aint a sports guy either so idk what March Madness means, you literally have to jingle keys at my face for me to understand)...."
Is it possible to fire the person who came up with this idea one thousand times?
That man never drank duff in his life.
"Never drank budlight in my life,I always drink Coors light now all my buddies are drinking it too 🤣🤣🤣🤣"
"I actually kinda feel sorry for dylan. I watched this promo fifty times &#39; and thoroughly dissected it. And i find that it was the company&#39;s fault for making him include the phrase womanhood&#39; that kinda insulted a sane persons common sense. Other than that , i thought he was funny actually. The other beer companys have gotten a hands on spanking on what not to do. Js"
Beer = Big gut. Don&#39;t drink the stuff :)
I had one budweiser at a bar about a month ago. Never again.
HE&#39;S my pick in the Deadpool every year now!
"I just recently learned about this ad, and I gotta say that I can kind of see why people think the way that they do. If anything the marketing team was just too politicized and incompetent.<br><br>Look, I can see that the goal was to target sexual minorities to sell expand the customer base, but the large part of the customer base was probably ticked off by the focus being on someone’s celebration of their transition and this advertisement being, in a half-assed way, linked to march madness. Some people also say that this person (Dylan is her name?) has an audience which includes a decent amount of minors. It is highly inappropriate to do advertising via her channel in that case.<br><br>So, whether right or wrong, a company has a customer base, and ideally, they should respect that customer base. Some people disliked the advertisement. Alright, so stop taking that advertisement route and do it in a more honest and less provocative manner next time (after a long while). Apologize and do advertisement strategies that appeal to everyone or most people.<br><br>And this is the issue: if bud light’s marketing team was honest about doing their work, they would do the above and actually submit to their customer base looking to continue to increase their company’s sales. A wrong thing to do would be to proceed to say that your customers are out of touch. That’s not marketing. That’s politicization, and a bitter aggression against the majority of your consumer base for not being politically brainwashed into accepting anything that is pro-gayism.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with gay people. However, there is something wrong about expecting everyone to feel the same way about gay people being promoted as gay people and leaving the beer as a secondary promotion while the collaboration should be secondary to the product.<br><br>Some people will like the ad, some people will dislike the ad, and some people don’t care either way. It’s disgusting to expect everyone to think the same way. It just doesn’t make sense, and it would be biased to say anything else other than “Anheuser-Busch’s marketing team is bad at marketing and political maniacs.”<br><br>By the way, I would say this if it went the other way, but there’s usually a “progressive” skew to these advertisement regressions. Companies should respect their customers or crumble. They exist only because the people work hard (most of the time) and spend their money on said products. Customers are venerable. And companies can only have a little bit of that venerability if they acknowledge that."
This is the new face of sobriety.
We&#39;re living in a Mike Judge movie.
This dude tanked a whole company . That&#39;s wild.
"AND Because of this man dressed as an embarrasing clown with an embarrasing message,there goes the entire Bud Light Company. You can&#39;t make this crap up! LOL"
Okay so this person saying hey I&#39;m an alcoholic I want a drink for any reason.
Miller lite is laughing all the way to the bank…..😂
The most expensive ad of all time
"hey dude,mam,sir,Mis,boy,girl,bro  whatever your smile looks totally fake,"
"If you were drinking Bud Light before this whole debacle, your opinions on social issues are not valid."
She broke the legs of every Clydesdale.
This year’s #1 Halloween costumes
I can’t believe that people let this trigger them so much.  This just proves that we have a nation of emotionally immature people.  🤷🏻‍♂️🙄🤦🏻‍♂️
"The lesson here is, too much Bud Light might make you think this is a woman"
I’ll take Miller light
Down goes Bud Light 😂
Wow!! Never drinking Bud again!!
GO SPORTS BALL TEAM! <br><br>😬 how TF could anyone from the top approve this to go out?… it’s just so cringey..
"So this is the Dude that killed Bud light,Awesome"
"I&#39;m a lumberjack, and I&#39;m alright<br>I work all day and I drink Bud light<br>He&#39;s a lumberjack, and he&#39;s alright<br>he works all day and he drinks Bud light<br>I cut down trees, I eat my lunch<br>I go to the lavatory<br>On Wednesdays I go shoppin&#39;<br>And have buttered scones for tea<br>He cuts down trees, he eats his lunch<br>He goes to the lavatory<br>On Wednesdays he goes shoppin&#39;<br>And has buttered scones for tea<br>I&#39;m a lumberjack, and I&#39;m alright<br> I work all day and I drink Bud light<br>I cut down trees, I skip and jump<br>I like to press wild flowers<br>I put on women&#39;s clothing<br>And hang around in bars<br>He cuts down trees, he skips and jumps<br>He likes to press wild flowers<br>He puts on women&#39;s clothing<br>And hangs around in bars<br>I&#39;m a lumberjack, and I&#39;m alright<br>I work all day and I drink Bud light<br>I cut down trees, I wear high heels<br>Suspendies, and a bra<br>I wish I&#39;d been a girlie<br>Just like my dear Papa"
"I think all the fuss about this was stupid AF and after watching the video cringy as it is I still feel that way, but holy shit is this lady creepy. She low key remind me of that momo challenge woman that parents we’re freaking out about a few years ago 😂"
Miller light or another brand should of made an ad of him where he drinks their beverage and he becomes a man again have his mom and dad crying of joy could get into more detail but I’d already be surprised if this stay up they could of had some fun with it
"I got tired of watching Budweiser commercial, I miss the Frogs and Lizards and the Real Men of Genius commercials those always crack me up. <br>Budweiser has gone soft...... Literally"
I sleep well at night knowing that the woke lady who was responsible for this will probably never work in marketing again. This will follow her forever.
What a freak show 😂😂😂 definitely not drinking budwiser ever againnn bruh
This guy is a real freak show.
What’s more hilarious is the number of people so bent out of shape about a commercial for the shittiest beer imaginable 😂 who even cares if they’re trans. This controversy has arguably made this the best Bud Light ad of recent years 😂
Homosexuals and lesbian repent Of your sins Jesus christ is coming soon
You blew it Budweiser <br><br>No more!
ONE trans made ONE commercial and ruined the company. how does that happen?
This is British comedian Kenny Everett&#39;s &#39;Cupid Stunt&#39; character in real life.
"I can&#39;t hate Dylan Mulvaney for this. They got offered a ton of money to endorse Bud Light (for whatever reason) and they clearly don&#39;t drink Bud Light or know anything about sports, but they said of course I&#39;ll take the money. They then made this outrageously gay commercial and probably forgot all about it until it came out. Now everyone is angry. Don&#39;t hate the player, hate the insane demonic game. I don&#39;t like Dylan and wouldn&#39;t want to be near them, but this is Bud Light&#39;s problem. They are the ones who chose to use them."
Bud bowl commercials where the best during Super Bowl! That’s all I have to say about this!
The 50 seconds that cost them billions       Keep it up people don’t buy this shit
"They wanted to be the trans beer, now they are.  Mission complete."
Beer has a lot of estrogen. So I think the comercial really tells you what will happen if you still drink beer.
"Even if the target audience was trans, this doesn’t even seem like an appealing or well planned commercial."
"bc of this, they&#39;ve lost 6 billion dollars in profit and it hasn&#39;t stop. Way to go!!!"
"Never drinking bud again, though I never had to begin with."
A guy posing as a woman and a beer posing as a real beer
"That commercial is just weird, regardless of the other stuff."
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
It’s Miller time 😂
It’s not a knock against Dylan. But Budweiser will never be purchased by me again. Ever.
Can we get back to the dilly dilly guys or the bud wei ser frogs
Imagine how mad stock investors are at the young man!
I love watching this commerical....shows me how  really stupid some people can be.......did you see the one where he thinks he&#39;s a possum ????
"I&#39;m not from the US, but I had heard bits and pieces about a controversial beer ad that had caused outrage and resulting sales losses. All these months later I thought I&#39;d watch whatever this travesty of an ad was all about. Finally I watch it and I fully laughed. This benign little thing set off so much havok? Wow, I expected a guy lighting puppies on fire and throwing them into a petrol soaked orphanage. But this. This is what gets the US up in arms? You guys are wound up way too tight!"
"What tripped me out was this mindset tbh. Let’s give this person millions of dollars to campaign a beer known to have huge sales for March madness, be totally clueless about what March madness is? Smh that’s insane"
Imagine thinking using a pedophile playing pretend as your spokesperson is sound marketing.
"If a person is free to announce their &quot;gender preferred&quot; pronoun, I am equally free to refer to them with the pronoun of my choice, which may reflect their original gender or their current gender. If for any reason either of us loses that, then we have lost a basic constitutional right."
"I&#39;m a Baby Boomer, so I come from a time in Americana where men were men and women did there best to be great wives, mothers and homemakers!<br><br>Everyone&#39;s roles were very defined. And then it seems that around 1977 when disco was big with partying, coke and lot&#39;s of sex, a lot more infidelity was just a side effect. Then more and more people started living together and more divorces. After this,  people coming out as gay was the big thing, and NOW women trying to be men and men trying to be women!<br><br>I feel for all you young people that didn&#39;t get to grow up at a time when parents, though unhappy, sometimes really strove to keep a good family unit together in behalf of the kids. A time when we played OUTSIDE, our Mom&#39;s made us lunch, we ate together as a family and for some, they waited for their Dad to come home to get SPANKED with a belt. 😅 Everyone knew the rules and there was very little back talk.<br><br>So for me to observe such upheaval, and a time when not only do women not want to be viewed as a &quot;homemaker&quot; but rather a successful &quot;influencer business person&quot; that travels to exotic places, dines out at the finest restaurants, wears designer clothes, fly&#39;s on private jets, wears expensive jewelry....that men subsidize, it&#39;s all just so foreign to me. This world is so messed up and ya&#39;ll have NO FRAME OF REFERENCE! How would you know better cause this was the world that your generations were born into!<br><br>So with this.... man/woman to have a following, it is what it is. I did sales and marketing for years and so I get that they were going after a specific market share by letting those people know that they appreciate their business.<br><br>Now if this ad had been directed to the MASSES.... then I would understand the uproar. I&#39;m not into their lifestyle but that is them. So if he/she has a following that is in agreement with her then I get that they did this for them. <br><br>I will NEVER accept trans AND Gay stuff being PUSHED on me as being NORMAL, but as long as they don&#39;t try to INFLUENCE or PROMOTE it to kids, then we need to let them live their lives. Many people HATE Black people (not sure why, when we are the ones that were used as slaves, beaten raped, families broken up, lynched, harassed by police, punished more severely by judges, denied government programs like the GI Bill, denied Home, Business and Mortgage loans to get out of the slums that the Government literally made for us while making white construction company&#39;s rich, denied equal scooling, illegally used for medical tests. And many of YOU have what, reason to hate US? But that&#39;s another discusion).<br><br>I say that to say, that it would be so awesome to &quot;turn our color off&quot; just so that we could be treated like everyone else!!! But we CAN&#39;T. So I don&#39;t feel a lot of sympathy for the Gay or LGBT community to be crying over not being treated like everyone else. They DON&#39;T have to choose to put it in people&#39;s faces.We don&#39;t have a choice cause many of you make up your mind about me as soon as you lay your eye&#39;s on me without knowing that I could very well be the funniest cool buddy of yours! So sad.<br><br>Sorry for getting off track. Bottom line is that unless you feel the need to CHOOSE to follow this individuals profile, fucking let it go, it has nothing to do with YOU or with a company trying to expand it&#39;s market share.  Or are you going to boycott any grocery stores where they shop, as well??? Are you?<br><br>This world is so messed up, so all you can do is try to be the best person you can be and associate with people that are like minded. If your other buddies are also racist then stick with them and continue to poison one another with your triggered nonsense. And I know that you will like that I used the word &quot;TRIGGER&quot; cause it&#39;s reminds you of the word... not so fast! 😂<br><br>Anyways, best wishes to everyone including, these unique people, Anheuser-Busch, and even you guys that hate me for no valid reason! 😊<br><br>Side note. I am allowed to ramble cause I&#39;m old. And don&#39;t forget, there was a time where many sporting events were boycotted because blacks were gonna be allowed to play in the game."
&quot;Welcome to the insane world of wokeness!&quot;
"I don&#39;t even drink beer and I found that repulsive somehow. <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/YvgfY-LIBpjChgHKyYCQBg""></a>"
"Even as an advert without the controversy, it&#39;s just terrible 😂"
How to lose $1 billion in less than a year:
I mean if you drink light beer you are already half way there
So what was you 367 days ago
"Imagine seeing this and getting so insulted that you have to tell everyone you&#39;re switching to a different brand of beer. It&#39;s like, do these people really have such uninteresting lives that &quot;boycotting&quot; a beer company is something worth their time? Here&#39;s a fun fact: probably every major beer company has at least one transgender employee, so that&#39;s your cue to stop being an alcoholic redneck"
Thanks for the ad Dylan. Won&#39;t be drinking this brand again.
Sometimes all you need is 40 seconds to take down an empire 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
This is a caricature of womanhood.
"I’m a straight, non-leftist man and even I know that that’s an offensive caricature of woman. In 365 days of womanhood, you discovered that the beauty of what makes a woman a woman is being ditzy and not knowing something pretty common knowledge about sports? I’m the one that’s seen as bigoted because I don’t support this person, yet I’m the one offended on behalf of women that he thinks this what it means to be a woman."
Is the first time that a marketing campaign convince me instantly to reject what is trying to sell.
ay dylan should appear in more beer ads lol she already did better than prohibition.
WELL I THINK HE DID A GREAT JOB!! <br><br>😤 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>😂
I think Bud Light was trying to say look he only has five cans. He’s one can shy of a six pack. 😂
I&#39;M A LADY CAN&quot;T YOU NOT SEE I&#39;M A LADY????
Why is this dude dressed up as a chick?
"I wish, after seeing this commercial, that my husband would boycott Budweiser( hecould cut down).. he couldn’t care less even if the devil himself was promoting it! Tbh, I was expecting something much more vulgar ; like Dylan doing a strip dance while chugging a Bud light… a lot of “guys” got their panties in a knot for a trans person promoting beer?! Who cares!🤷🏻‍♀️"
Faaaak when he smiles he looks the main witch from the movie witches
"&quot;To say of what is, that it is not or of what is not, that it is - is false. And to say of what is, that it is, and of what is not, that it is not  - is true&quot;  - Aristotle, Correspondence Theory of Truth<br><br>If you have a hard time believing in the Aristotelian model for truth (philosophy), you&#39;re the reason why this nonsense exists."
"I don’t hate anybody but if Bud Light was going to legitimately support LGBTQ, I’d like to think that they could have done a hell of a lot better than this. I mean all BS aside, look at the presentation. This looks like it’s marketed directly towards elementary school students. Associating alcohol and sexuality with children is not okay. I can vividly recall the Bud Light commercials from the 90’s when I was a kid and it showed a frog with its tongue out sticking to the back of the beer truck. We all laughed at it. Since then they’ve had pretty mainstream and lame commercials. That didn’t really matter at the end of the day because they had neat merchandise, bowling pin shaped bottles, and a decent product. Now, those old neon signs and clocks are going for dirt cheap. This just wasn’t a very good commercial from any perspective."
The queen of beers
I never thought someone would single handedly destroy budlight. This chick had the BALLS to do it 😂
"And just like that, millions of blue collar workers across the nation said, &quot;Nah.&quot;"
Bud&#39;s lite went out
Our local AA has started using this ad to help addicts quit
Straight up painful to watch
Bud light sucks anyway
"If you are offended by this business, then do not buy their product. But,  nobody has a right, to condemn, harass, insult, mock, and terrify another human being. Let God judge. As a Christian,this really breaks my heart. I used to live this lifestyle, until Jesus set me free by his love. I pray the same for Dylan.<br><br>&quot; If you, O LORD, kept track of iniquities, then who, O Lord, could stand?&quot;<br><br>                      God loves you Dylan, you are not alone."
These people need to grow up and see they were just trying to broaden their audience into the LGBTQ+ community!
"Why would anyone be so upset watching this that it would cause a boycott?<br>If you don&#39;t like it, give it an eye roll and move on"
This dude is creepy.
What&#39;s sup bro?
Bud Light Then: 🗿😎🍷<br><br>Bud Light Now: 🤡🤢🤮<br><br>Bud Light has Become Woke Disney!
We all know how this ended...
This disgusted me
"I&#39;ve always thought that the United States is too immersed in political correctness, but when I saw the comments, that prejudice disappeared."
What is this &quot;oh-I&#39;m-a-woman-so-I-have-to-be-sports-stupid&quot; bs?
66th Grammy Awards will may be sponsored by Bud Light!! And I would boycott them too not just the UFC!!
Those beer cans are obviously empty!
I just realized this dude must be trying to look like the Audrey actress from Breakfeast at Tiffany&#39;s
Yeah if you don’t like the ad that’s fine but there is literally nothing about this that you need to be complaining or boycotting. It’s literally just a beer commercial trying to sale nothing else. You have to be a real cry baby or fragile person if you make a big thing out of this.
How to destroy your company in 2023 101
this stopped ppl drinking more than prohibition did back then
I used to drink bud light but now I drink Polish vodka.
Don&#39;t hold my beer. He/She/They/Them are holding it.
"This guy lost Bud light 30 billion dollars.  Also got many Bud light beer drinkers to switch brands.  It will take Bud years to recover, even if they do."
"If Dylan was intelligent, he/she/we/they would have shorted the Bud Light stock before recording this video. No matter how committed you are to a cause, you can still see the outcome from a mile away. Would have made more money than Hindenburg."
"Finally, I watched this after the controversy has died down, and I&#39;m surprised how tame this was? I was expecting a full blown commercial advocating for trans rights, showing weird looking men in drag, although maybe you could say Dylan fits that description, but still, I&#39;m talking game stop Ma&#39;am type shit. I&#39;ve seen worse holiday commercials from the likes of Hillshare farms, Tyson, and various other Turkey and Ham companies around Thanksgiving and Christmas that put this to shame. Honestly, for all the outrage around this person and Bud Light, I&#39;m kind of disappointed."
The Perfomist is kinda overdoing acting ngl
video should be called how to destroy a name brand in less than a minute
Imagine the value of that empty (or full) can of bud when it appears on ebay
"Just goes to show that if you&#39;re In marketing, you can&#39;t afford to be out of touch with reality."
<b>THREW ALL MY</b> 🍻 <b>DOWN THE</b> 🚽
Keep your bud lights guy
I’m 14 I can’t even drink and I hate bud light already
Who’s here after what Planet Fitness did?
What if hes just a super troll playing 8d chess and hes taking down brands for the fun of it
Lmao what? How was everyone so offended over this? Hilarious how the right side says the left is so easily offended when this made them lose their minds lmao
I honestly don&#39;t even mind the commercial. It&#39;s the pandering that companies do cash in on the latest trend. It&#39;s sickening.
Getting over the obvious cringe this commercial is… i think one of the more unspoken cringier things is him acting like a lot of girls don’t know what March madness is at the beginning
"Seriously, why do people always talk shit but never talk about they feel. It doesn&#39;t feel like the wokeness is the problem. It feels like people are using their trans status as excuse to bully them instead of just telling them that the way the ad is presented just comes off ignorant. Seriously, why is bullying and the norm instead of proper feedback."
"With all the talk about this, I really though they were going full woke, with rainbow cans and transgender discounts or something. I don&#39;t get it this isn&#39;t even close to what netflix and countless others are doing. While I couldn&#39;t be further from ever sideing with lgbt stuff, I see no issue in whomever to drink shit beer and even promote it."
"I don’t get why people are so mad about this. Yea, it’s obviously a company that has too much money to give a fuck about what gender someone is, but you see that with all companies now, so I don’t think bud light should get any hate for it"
"When the boycott began, i asked anyone to give me their Bud light cans they dont want anymore, since then i have not spent a penny on buying BL and have even sold quite a few six packs to people who don&#39;t give a fuck about this dude sponsorship, all they care for is the beer, and i recovered quite some money from the beer I bought before this boycott, and i still have lots of BL stocked."
"Putting aside anything about trans people, the ad is just... bad. I thought that it might at least be something creative, or at least not look like a video some random shot on their iPhone. They couldn&#39;t do better?"
Im just curious about what this Bud Light boycott is more over? The fact they asked a transgender person to do well what i would not call an ad or the fact they put Dylan Mulvaneys image on 1 can which is a souvernier can for Mulvaney alone?
"ahhh, the old &quot;im a woman, i know nothing about sports, tee hee!&quot; it&#39;s insulting. <br>For a community that doesn&#39;t like stereotyping and labeling, they certainly do a lot of it."
So people are boycotting Bud Light just because they hired a trans woman to promote their beer?<br><br>Is it correct or did I miss something?<br><br>And bullying someone for basically nothing is beyond disgusting.<br>It seems people lost their hearts and souls. I don&#39;t understand at all why y&#39;all so mean to her.
Only thing that can top this is if NASCAR paints gay flags on their cars. Has to be the biggest advertising disaster in history lol
Schools will teach kids that this was actually a brilliant marketing campaign destroyed by conservatives. However your economics professor will call bullshit and call it what it is. A terrible idea.
"I know this is just a reupload and that you are not that man, but man I can&#39;t stop myself from disliking this"
"Why does he sound that egoistic, when he is mocking march madness ?<br>You get a deal with a large brand, and you talk about yourself ? 😂"
So cringey that &quot;she&quot; has &quot;no knowledge of sports&quot; like some stereotype.<br>Everyone knows March Madness means basketball. AND I&#39;M A GAY BOY.
Oh no a bucnh of cranky old men and highschool drop outs are mad 😢
Why did bud light pick dylan as the face of their brand? Instead of doing rainbow cans like previous years?
"As much as I dislike Mulvaney, this ad is really nothing compared to the anti-male, anti-white racist Gillette branding campaign of 2019.  It&#39;s a shame that this one-off TikTok video sparked the backlash that Gillette should have suffered."
"Who should&#39;ve made billions? Would be Mary Tyler Moore , but unfortunately shes not with us 😢 by the way did he try 2 look like her ?"
"More than anything, I&#39;m surprised someone thought a good commercial would be a portrait mode video with some random person pretending to be ignorant about a sports tournament featuring athletes who mostly aren&#39;t old enough to consume the product being promoted."
"I’ve heard the crying for months and had to know for myself. Wow, so that’s it? Disappointed head shake boys.  The forecast is calling for snow"
Who’s on first? What’s on second. And I don’t know what the fluck is going on in third. 🤪🤪🤪
"It&#39;s a terrible ad, but that&#39;s what people got upset over? You&#39;re not a real man if this offended you."
All it took was two  people to destroy an iconic brand. One man (Dylan Mulvaney) and one woman (Alissa Horseface).
"Really mind boggling that THIS is THE ad, looks like she herself set up the camera filmed a short &amp; the whole ass corporation ran it?! Plus so many odd and questionable nuances in the spew of words 🤡☠"
wait… i’m genuinely confused. not even being sarcastic when i ask: is THIS the ad that made everyone boycott bud light???
Just apologize and this boycott would be over but as long as you are so self involved you will keep going down the tubes…
I’m 44 and I’m never gonna get drunk on bud light again I’m throwing that shit away
Guys we are gay now nah nah jk but bro they be saying u gay if u drink this
I&#39;ll come every year to laugh at this again. I prep myself by reading the &quot;2023 Bud Light boycott&quot; wikipedia article to make it even funnier.
Still don’t understand problem with that (i‘m German and beero-holic)
Saved cans maybe worth something historically in a 100 years
Budweiser has joined the Freakshow. Go Woke Go Broke. Good riddance
This was when Bud Light decided to be the Queen of Beers 🍺!!! 🤣😂😅😂🤣
One can killed my favorite beer brand now I’m a Modelo drinker and coors
"Wow, he did better than the prohibition ever could have."
Queer killed this beer
Imagine it being viewed as more manly to drink sparkling strawberry wine than a bud light or bud lol
"Now it&#39;s BUTT Light, not Bud Light anymore."
This is the shit that makes me not want to exist lol 💀
It took me 5 minutes to find this video. Its being suppressed lmao
Thank you for this ad its honestly made me quit drinking
The commercial will live in infamy.
So this was the commercial that offended millions???
This foo looks like he’s forcing himself to drink it😂
As a walmart bag I am offended by this commercial😒
Worst commercial ever stop this madness now!!!!
I wonder how many more sponsorshipsDylan will get
"A parody of a woman, a mockery of women"
The person in charge of commercial advertising at Bud company who choose dylan and trans concept must be fired and ban forever
aint even a minute long and people got so mad...
Nonce ad I&#39;ll never drink bud light again
If this is what my son has to grow up seeing. Then this generation of people is truely the worst of all time. Any other country in this world can do better then this. Anyone. Ill say it again. Anything can do better then this. One last time. A blade of grass has more value then this person.
Thought it was way worse 😂 like who cares
"Congrats for grounding such a big beer brand alone. Btw, you had 0 days of womanhood, so there&#39;s really nothing to celebrate."
the worst mistake a company has ever made
Budweiser went from &quot;Real Men of Genius&quot; to &quot;Fake Females with Penis&quot; in 50 Seconds.
Мужик в маске женщины делает пародию на обезьяну и пьет пиво?
"What strikes me most about this ad is how very very cheap it looks, and apparently unscripted and utterly witless. &quot;Whatever team you love I love&quot;--dear God. Someone on the inside must have wanted to really screw the company."
"Okay, I must be dumb, whats wrong with this? xD"
This is the entirety of the original commercial?
Bud wasn&#39;t Wiser. Go Broke fools.
Your not supposed to drink that anymore ☝🏾
NOPE to WOKE! Bud Light = 🤢🤮💩
What&#39;s worse then piss water gay piss water
Sad that Dylan did not know what March Madness was.
This is pathetic. BL deserves this backlash.
the way this dude drink the beer is ridiculous🤬
"Like pitching Bud Light cans that say &quot;Go Yankees&quot; to the Boston, Fenway park neighborhood."
This is a commercial??
My liver thanks you
You know.  I think that if Dylan was actually attractive or looked more like a girl people wouldn&#39;t be so pissed about this.  When I found out Dylan was picked by a female I wasn&#39;t surprised.  You need a trans woman who makes straight men question their sexuality.  I recommend Bailey Jay.
We gotta make sure that dipship VP never finds a job as a McDonalds janitor ever again
I dont see what the problem is honestly. If your going to stop drinking Budwiser because of an image on a beer can than you are a weak minded person. Just because R. Kelly did what he did didnt stop me from listening to his music. Or with Michael Jackson. I also loved the Cosby Show and I still do. People are stupid and are always looking for reasons to lash out.
I got into this way too soon. What is it with bud light and this commercial?? Someone please explain.
"I don&#39;t get this add. Even if you leave the politics out of it, what the hell is the viewer supposed to get from it? Literally nothing of substance is said"
What happened to the marketing team who came up with this advert? Were they fired??
Why dress for the opera house to &quot;pre game&quot;
what a mentalist needs to be put in a ward
This man killed bud light
I don’t believe he’s a woman but I don’t see what upset so many people about this...
The voice reeks of XY chromosomes
Why does his face look like that
he reminds me of hanks wife in breaking bad
Maybe this was a secret message from the ceo meaning if you keep drinking bud light you will be like dylan in the future
"Thanks Dylan, I&#39;m never drinking this piss ever again"
What in the name of Jehovah is this ?
That guy is weird
Bud Light to Modelo
Why does it look like a bobblehead?
"Wow. I&#39;m a female (and I always have been... and I always will be... barring any future reincarnation... but you know what I mean), and I know that March Madness is basketball. I always do a bracket! How offensive is this implication that women are idiots about sports? Granted, I&#39;m not a basketball fan, and I do the bracket for fun, but come on, who doesn&#39;t know about March Madness? And if you were a man until a year ago, you really should&#39;ve known about March Madness! Dude, become a man again and learn about sports! Please!"
I don’t get the outrage over this video
GO WOKE- GO BROKE...
They need to fire Dylan.
We don&#39;t do this here
"I will be 100%<br>Dylan here from this specific angle does not look like some monster who steals kids and eats their skin to stay young, and their voice doesn&#39;t have the insufferable pitch it usually does. Good job audio editor, camera guy and makeup dep"
"No bud, no lgbt."
Go woke go broke lol
That&#39;s a demon
This is what started all that drama this wasn&#39;t even a minute long people chose a dumb hill to die on
Go woke go broke
He&#39;s such a cutie. Would eat.
Never buying it
"The best way to destroy a business is promote these things and success is guaranteed. Sexual preferences , religion preferences shouldn’t be used on a product used by everyone. Target is being screwed nicely to ."
Wow wtf. 🤮
"We need to immediately Check the horse barns and assure the safety of the horses in the barn.  No tellin, what AB is up too we should also make it like guns it’s a AB free zone,Schools Hospitals, Court Rooms, Bars, Back Yards, grassy knolls, ooo yea, Los Vegas!!!"
This looks more like a TikTok video more than a commercial.
This video cost 80 billion dollars.
This is why people are mad? I don&#39;t get it.
"What is the problem? The beer tastes the same, but now a bunch of fjollor have problems.<br><br>Beer commercials have made fun of people for many years."
"Its getting close to  Holidays and Me and my family drank Budweiser  had a trip planned for Disney,  shopped at Target, watched NFL and MLB games  Everything is done now These Woke companies like Kellogg&#39;s don&#39;t need   our families money I guess. I am done with them all. Will shop at mom and pop stores and drink Coors,  and watch my dogs play while fishing and camping."
Plot twist: the guy who hired Dylan M. and promoted this ads is actually Miller light´s manager infiltrated in Bud headquarters in disguise
"dude what a weird commercial....what were they thinking. its not even about having this guy in the commercial, its just a bad commercial regardless of whether its a trans dude or straight dude"
...this is what made people so mad? 😂😂😂
"This is the commercial that is destroying Bud Light?<br>I don&#39;t get it. All I see is someone making a clown out of themselves. If you&#39;re making an ad, one would think you&#39;d research the content of the ad, instead of making the ad all about your ignorance of sports and yourself.<br>How did nobody flag this before it made it to market?"
It’s kind of like watching the “Straight Dave” scene at the end of Bruno play out in real life for months on end lol
It takes girls 18 years to become a woman but you become a women just after a thought....... Mental illness is serious.  I hope he gets the help he needs
Dylan is like - I don&#39;t give a f about your interests. Buy beer
"Jiop <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVGDPlG42bU&amp;t=49"">0:49</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVGDPlG42bU&amp;t=49"">0:49</a>"
Now ‘Real Gone’ song needs to change it’s lyrics
He also ruined the liver transplant industry…….
"No, people weren&#39;t &quot;offended&quot; by this. They found it laughable and pathetic pandering."
Miller sitting back like “yesssss come to the dark side”
"In 5 years, we’ll find out that Dylan received a million dollar donation from Alcoholics Anonymous"
"Sky Australia News coined the phrase, “Go Woke, go Broke! I highly doubt that Bud Light would be willing to try it again!"
Women don’t talk/ act like that. Flipped like three different stereotypes of women in one commercial….how isn’t that offensive to feminists.
One has to wonder what that can will be worth in 50 years
THIS is the commercial? Anti climactic af. I love it when the population shows exactly how much power they truly have but of all things that have been going in recently the fact that this is the turning point is funny to me
This guy went through all the trouble to change gender becomes a woman and for what for man&#39;s pleasure? What women role in the world?
"Budwiser before: &quot;Bud&quot; &quot;WISE&quot;&quot;ER&quot;<br><br>Budwiser now: &quot;Bud&quot; &quot;EXCUSE ME, ITS MAM!&quot;"
&quot;oh gee im a &#39;woman&#39; so of course i dont know anything about sports or anything&quot;...btw why is his name still Dylan?

If a beer company targets the wrong community of their woke madness 😅....
"the stock price hit it&#39;s lowest in JUNE at $53 when this manufactured controversy happened in april the stock price was roughly at $62 in APRIL the stock price now is up to $64, yep they reallllllllllllllllllly felt that boycott."
Dylan Mulvaney Vs Juaquin&#39;s  Joker
The boycott wouldn&#39;t have been as successful as it was if Bud Light didn&#39;t taste like aged piss water taken from a football stadium during the Super Bowl. People are giving Dylan Mulvaney too much credit I think.
The agenda is fkn itself. ❤😂😂
Oh my god THIS is what every body is so mad about??? Jesus Christ😭😭😭😭. Yall I am a woman and though I don’t speak for all- pretty sure you just wanted a reason to be transphobic. So we’re gonna act like all trans women misunderstood girlhood because one popular trans creator made ONE offhand joke???? Seriously??? Also can we stop blaming HER for “destroying” Bud light? How about addressing the millions of transphobic people who just don’t like her or trans people. 🤦‍♀️
Congratulations To Bud Light For Successfully Destroying Your Brand!
Probably going to have to change the name of the beer to BUTT Light.....just saying!!!!!!
"&quot;Impressive carrying skills, right?&quot; Well, you have man hands, because ... you&#39;re a MAN, so... No, not impressive."

"Even leaving aside the identity politics mess... this is cringy. Like, you know those jokes in The Simpsons where Krusty has a prerecorded speech saying &quot;I wholeheartedly approve of the mentioned product or service&quot;? It feels like that.

This thing should  get so drunk it kill it self
The best ever Transheuser-Busch commercial.
What&#39;s insulting was Dylan didn&#39;t know what March Madness means and what team to support. It&#39;s sports related and he/she should have known what it was. I don&#39;t know much about sports but people get mad about that especially beer-loving sports fanatics.
"Pride month? Sure, it’d make sense, but the Final Four is sacred to some people, especially alumni’s ts and most sports fans like myself aren’t offended by transgenderism, just turned off by putting up a person that knows nothing of sports, and the celebration of someone that participated in the eradication of women’s events like……NCAA women’s basketball which was actually 10 times more exciting than any WNBA games lol. The only sport where a man can simply identify as a woman, step on the court and dominate a group of young women that worked their whole lives to get into that position."
Anheiser&#39;s only road to recovery....<br>Bring back the wazzzaaap boyz
"Andheiser Busch is in America&#39;s rear view mirror. Nothing more than a distant memory!!<br>GO WOKE, GO BROKE!!!"
As of this POST - BUD has lost over 25% market share - Thousands of people laid off from their jobs - and RETAILERS are making space for other products...
It&#39;s a cute commercial.  But the powers that be clealry didn&#39;t know who their consumer was.<br>This would have been a fun soda or juice commercial.
"It&#39;s wild how all the think pieces and articles made people think that this was some kind of nationally syndicated commercial, instead of one single partnered video on Dylan Mulvaney&#39;s TikTok, which, unless you already watch trans influencers regularly,  you probably never would have seen unless you went searching for it"
What a real man of genius this individual is amirite
This is so innocent and harmless. Just wow
This video is like someone sparking a match
That looks like a student project lol
Been hearing about this for months and finally sought this commercial out and...<br>It&#39;s boringly tame lol.
"Who gave this ad the green light? Honestly, zero awareness of their brand or their customer base."
Not the first time Buds done this folks.. except Spuds Mackenzie was a female dog presented as a Male... but I gotta ask didn&#39;t anyone at Corporate think of doing a private screening to judge how consumers might react??
i&#39;ll never drink a bud again i suere
That pathetic can with his face on it is hilarious. Most expensive can ever made.
Certified hood classic
This aged like fine excrement 👏🏻👍🏻🙌🏻
"When you&#39;re doing a BudLight commercial, you got to have lifted white trucks full of Mexicans out on a ranch, a couple rancheros walk out holding onto a wooden fence, discussing jovially in Spanish about a days wild happenings, they hold onto an old rickity fence, a can of BudLight in their free hand, while watching another ranchero ride a crazy horse rodeostyle. &quot;Hey you crazy loco, you ride a horse like an Americano!&quot; They giggle, the camera pans to show a can of icy BudLight near a wooden post, the ranchero on his horse in a blur behind it.  Guaranteed massive BudLight Commercial Appeal!😂"
"Bud Light will bounce back, people are fickle. The image of this person trying to enjoy beer will last a lifetime."
"to sell their beer, they brought it to Russia despite the sanctions. I laughed hysterically when I saw the budlight in the village store."
The commercial mocks the sports fan. Trivialises their support of a team. How is that likely to help sales when the beer company is mocking the consumer that might ordinarily like to enjoy a beer with their mates after a hard weeks work?
"😜😝😝😝Nach einer Werbekampagne mit Transgender-Influencerin Dylan Mulvaney ist der Umsatz der US-Biermarke Bud Light stark eingebrochen. Dies, weil landesweit zum Boykott aufgerufen wurde.....<br><br>Hahahahaaa,ich gönn es denen..."
Have just watched the commercial for the first time and I am stunned. It is absolutely pathetic. It is so amateurish and the resulting boycott is understandable. Who on earth would ever think they have got a winner there.
Bud Light has fell from number 1 after 20 yrs. number one Beer - a Mexican brand dethroned them
"My frustration is that we are being told that we should educate ourselves and not be ignorant to their views… yet she can’t take the time to know what is March Madness and at least pretend she likes sports if she’s going to sell us on a product. As always, double standard smh."
"Bud Light used to be a beer for truckers.<br>So, it makes sense to have a lot lizard advertising it."
RIP BUD LIGHT   The ceo is responsable for this dizaster
"Not even drinking it either, as a professional at this, at that angle Dylan maybe got a teaspoon at most of beer"
"Well, well, well, people offended. Imagine that"
Pride. Where brands go to die.
This man ruined bud light for good. Be honest when’s the last time you’ve seen someone have that after the commercial?
this is the commercial...
wow. In hindsight watching this is like watching the titanic sink from a small boat whilst eating popcorn.
It was never a commercial. It was an Instagram post.
SNL couldn&#39;t have done it better 😅
"If you&#39;re reading this, chances are it&#39;s for your Influencer Marketing college class. Looks like you&#39;re on the What Not To Do chapter. Best of luck this semester!"
Anyone remember the funny bud light commercials of the 90s? They should have stuck with that.
It puts the lotion on its skin or else it drinks the beer again
"&quot;Do you just wake up in morning and think, holy s**t I&#39;m going to be a tumor today?&quot; ~Filthy Frank"
"I had to pause at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVGDPlG42bU&amp;t=26"">0:26</a>, no particular reason, just that I couldn’t breath the moment the video played"
"Get Woke, Go Broke! <br>🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮<br>😂😂😂😂😂😂"
Women don&#39;t even buy Bud light like that..<br>So they chose a transgender that thinks he is a adolescent little girl. How dangerous is that to children. People aren&#39;t just mad you change the beer. you chose a man in women&#39;s attire who thinks he&#39;s an underage girl. And you think I&#39;m going to have my kids around that insanity.<br>He needs a therapist . I took my time to look this person up and he wants to be around children but he&#39;s a grown man acting like a female child oh hell no .
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I’ll tell my grandchildren this was Martha Stewart
"OK, now I get it 👌"
I&#39;m glad I only drink heavy alcohol. And now no more anhuser Busch beer. Or what ever the fuck it&#39;s called.
That commercial feels sticky!
"I just asked a feminist would you leave your kids in a room with him , be honest <br>Answer<br>No"
🤮🤮🤮
🤮🤢
🤮
How is that even a real person
🤢🤢
Its like a contest to create the worst advertisement for a beer.... that wins.
Almost unbelievable that such a meaningless and silly thing would go on to cause so much trouble.
Sick bast$## I wouldn&#39;t buy Bud Light if it was the last beer on earth... This whole world has gone mad😢
"They knew their age demographic, what were they thinking?"
"She, he I don’t care what you are but that’s Michael Jackson got that he he"
Thanks Mulvaney I have stopped drinking. I&#39;m getting in better physical shape
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVGDPlG42bU&amp;t=31"">0:31</a> gets me every time lol"
This this is why you dont hire woman to market on behalf of your company
i have not seen bud light in my town since this
Maybe i dont get it.. but the ad isnt that bad? Certainly not boycot worthy imo.
So in other words he barracks for every team spare me.
tengo una pregunta por su sonrisa parece que muy rígida  ?
That’s it. I thought he would use  a can and throw it at a dog based on how the reaction was
People actually got mad at this 😂😂😂
This is horrifying
I am really enjoying my switch to Coors Light.  Thanks Anheiser Busch.
And this vid destroyed an empire.
Wow look it&#39;s audrey hepburn!
World have turned into something very bizarre.
Mssp Dawgs what up. Super star garddoggy I see you..lemorp where you at?!?
"After reading the comments had no idea who this was but should have figured that by the name it was a dude.<br>I don&#39;t know, don&#39;t care about all that.  That&#39;s how chicks act and there are always going to be dudes who feel like it&#39;s not cool to front on the gender you&#39;re born with, perpetrating.  Feel like people masquerade and don&#39;t want to respect, trying to change a person that&#39;s unaware.  If you are getting physical with someone they have a right to know what you were when it comes to gender.<br><br>Don&#39;t have to like, but still don&#39;t hate.  Give me a some beer and leave me be when I ask, understand?  <br>I don&#39;t think the commotion was such a big deal but I do understand the response was what you can expect.  Now please get back to the game and chill."
Part of the distaste for this ad is it basically mocks the sports industry. Bud Light is successful because of sports fans and this person doesn’t care about sports at all. - go team? What sport is March Madness?  Know your audience.  99% are sports fans and this persons ignorance of sports being featured on a national campaign is going to torpedo the product
Ridiculous the outrage from this simple video lmao. People need to get a life. There are more important things to lose your shit over than this.
"I&#39;ve heard about this bud light saga, as a genuine outsider to this, is this the advertisement that killed bud light with their main target customers, or was it a whole campaign of advertising using Dylan Mulvaney that done it?<br>And this is the only thing I know Dyan for, so I have no real background to this person apart from them being trans."
"Ok Its bad but not as half bad as Gillette add , i think that one was mutch worse"
Lost billions of money!! Oh well that’s what they get!! Well deserved Bud Light !!!!!
Eef Hoos: Ik heb alles verkankerd.<br><br>Bud Light: Hou mijn bier en woke-waanzin vast...
"hard one to understand this move from Bud.... why would the brand do this?... I get that you might want to diversify your brand. I get that you want to move away from beer guzzling frat boys and redneck image at the BBQ. (no, not stating beer drinkers are always this.. just.. making a point.. relax)..  But.. you&#39;re then going to target the audience that is in the VAST minority in the world (but for some reason heavily catered to). <br>Not only are you targeting a negligible audience when it comes to possible sales,  but at the same time that new audience and the spokesperson that you decide to use aren&#39;t &quot;supported&quot; or accepted by a significant portion of your current consumers... how else did Bud expect this to go down?...  non-beer drinkers aren&#39;t all of a sudden going to start drinking beer..  but your current consumers will certainly stop drinking your brand when you change the &quot;image&quot; of that brand.. from ordering a bud light to have a beer, now ordering a bud light is a political woke statement that no-one wants to take part of when ordering a beer...  same as how the Ford Raptor now quickly became the car to &quot;represent&quot; trans.. simply because Ford put a rainbow on it...  Ford Raptor owners, clearly the most woke people out there....? why would you mess that image up."
"Just now seeing this. The thing that gets me is the can design. Its really poorly done. I think they were maybe trying to rattle peoples cage with this, at least part of their base demographic, only why would you do that? Its a really bad design."
Soon there will be no more bud light or any bud because of this insulting video. There should be a statement about who was responsible for this and the person they sponsored like Mulvaney could care less about saying about this meltdown.
"Why is everyone blaming him for the troubles the company ran into because of this commercial? He did the job he was hired to do. The company didn’t get taken down because of Dylan…They got taken down because of their own decisions to make this commercial, and not test it with a control group, and air it."
"- So we have a multi-billion dollar product and need an ad to consolidate our position in the market, any suggestions? <br>- Yup. I was thinking, we could employ one of the most controversial personalities in America, who knows nothing about sport, has a really awkward fake smile and ask them to record something on a mobile phone. It will be dirt cheap and save us a packet by not using an advertising agency.<br>- Excellent idea, get that done will you."
"Even if he was a genius, nobody could see that… nobody can see anything about his personality because he keeps making his sexual identity his whole identity. He’s cultivating that himself. That’s why nobody recognizes anything else about him, except for one single thing which is that he’s transgender. If that’s what he wants to be recognized for, that’s what he got. Stop complaining."
"It really isn’t that offensive. Sure, she’s not that likeable, but I can’t see anything offensive about it at all. Who gives a shit what other people do with themselves anyway? I’m less concerned about her, and more concerned about the amount of people who seem to be obsessively concerned about the sexuality of somebody else. I expect some backlash for this post, but I don’t drink the kind of beer bigots drink - and I drink with people who aren’t preoccupied with thinking transexuals all day 🤔"
First time I&#39;ve seen this ad. I&#39;ve been a copywriter in the ad industry for 18 years. One of my jobs is to come up with the ideas for ads. This was just so bad. Not just in the whole idea of using someone who is not right for the brand but in the execution.
"I really dont think they wanted to ruin the company, its their body, let them do whatever"
The devil is she
I fucking hate that little tap tap he does on the can before opening it. Really infuriates me.
"I&#39;ve just seen the ad for the first time. I&#39;m just as tired as the next guy of being force-fed so-called woke propaganda, but this is pretty mild compared to a lot of other ads. I never thought I&#39;d say this, but the reaction of a lot of right-wingers to this ad feels transphobic."
"love to see all those hurt americans cry about their beloved beer, keep it coming lmao 🍺"
"It would have been ok if he/she didn&#39;t thematized her transition and calling it womanhood. This person itself isn&#39;t so unlikable, but it should be about beer and sports and not about gender issues of a person."
"My goodness.  I can&#39;t believe this. I&#39;ve been hearing all this hooha for months now. And this was it? Bud light sends a can of beer with an impression of Fylan Mulvaney&#39;s face to her, and noone else,   she talks about it and everyone stops drinking Bud light? <br>You guys are ridiculous.<br>Enjoy your new favourite beer."
"...who green lit this?<br>&quot;Hi! Impressive carrying skills, right?&quot; <br>&quot;I heard about this thing called march madness...&quot;<br>&quot;...and I thought we were all just having a hectic month, but it turns out it has something to do with sports.&quot;<br>&quot;And I&#39;m not sure exactly which sport, but, either way it&#39;s a cause to celebrate.&quot;<br><br>......You can stop it right there, what the fuck are they doing? I don&#39;t think I could write a worse opening.  <br><br>Everything else aside, this is just...not good."
That can is legitimatley the most frightening thing ive seen 😅
This shoulb be a madatory video that has to be seen at AA mettings
"They did it for their ESG score. They don&#39;t care about profit anymore, and least of all the customers that corporations only see as $$$. What&#39;s coming down the pipeline is much more terrifying than this slap in the face."
"Im from germany, man I love how americans manage to come together and boycott these type of things.."
"I don’t mind trans people, but can y’all non sports fans stop pretending that you have no idea what’s going on. It’s not a personality trait to be confused on what the Super Bowl or think we’re all “going crazy in March”"
"Alyssa Heinerscheid: &quot;Okay, so my mandate was crystal clear: Alienate our loyal customers, blue collar workers and frat boys, by putting some drag queen on our can and drink our product in a commercial! Celebrate diversity and inclusivity!&quot;"
"I understand their motive:<br><br>They want to attract new customers, but they forgot to consider the risk of pissing off their old customers, it&#39;s happening everywhere because half ass marketing companies never changes."
Dude destroyed a beer franchise and both genders in one video..
It’s amazing how this was such a big deal. What does the average Bud Light drinker look like? Just make a commercial with a talking dog. That can’t lose. Why did they think this would work? When you do something like this everybody suspects you’re forcing an agenda and it fuels a bunch of bullshit.
People stopped drinking piss water cuz some person on the internet drank it.
"I like watching Amy Schumer because I dont have time to watch all the other comedians and hear their best jokes, so I come her knowing she will tell them for me!"
The title “comedy legends” with Amy was the best joke here!
Comedy legend? That’s a stretch
"Yes, Amy, you won!"
"She&#39;s hysterical, I love Amy Schumer!"
Shes not a &quot;legend&quot;.
I don’t know if there’s some other reason she has so many haters but honestly I watched this with an open mind and it was pretty funny
She&#39;s a legend in he own mind...nowhere else!
Legend in her own mind.
This is the best set she&#39;s ever done.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>And it sure is terrible.
"I&#39;m far from a comedy authority. But that was one of the funniest acts I&#39;ve seen. And, plus, Amy is a full blown babe!"
so pretty
"Is it me???!! Or is Amy delish???!!!? :P I know, I know... But still!!! :D xoxo Amy Muah!!!!"
Comedy Legend my ass….you can see open mic night comics better than her in any town.
"Sorry, but nothing she said was funny.<br><br>And I hate when comedians put their parents down.<br><br>I do not think that I would pay hard earned money to see her live."
Yall hating she doin it 😂
georl u should be washin dishes that would be funnier - at best you look like sauerkraut und wurst
Snuffleapagus. Solid. 🤣🤣
She is gross. Never been funny.
"Amy thank you!! You are really funny and you have quite a delivery and you are very pretty , stunning twinkle oin your eyes."
"Her Uncle Chuck is way, way funnier!"
This is a current video? I thought it was a vintage
&quot;Die Ganze Show&quot;<br><br>...Shouldn&#39;t that say &#39;Die Gaza&#39; as it&#39;s Amy Shumer? 🤷
"hmm, I didn&#39;t laughed once, am I to intellegent? This is so cringe ..."
"Wow Amy, lookin&#39;  F  I  N  E  ! ! !"
Why do all comedians give a punchline and then say um. It&#39;s strange
I tried....but Amy is as ineffective trying to be funny as Unca Chuck is at pretending to be a statesmen!!!!!  They both need to STOP!!!
“Comedy legend”? Seriously? lol
Haven&#39;t cracked a single simle. I tried. 😐😐😐 This was terrible.
Love you ❤️‍🔥🌹🎨☝️😎✌️🌄🥰
I love Amy👍🏻👍🏻
"Conflicted - Alot of shade thrown at Amy by other comedians for her stealing jokes.  I cannot believe that the majority of the material here is not her own, but I side with the comedians which is a shame because this is a great special and Amy looks amazing."
She is look&#39;n FINE!!  GREAAAAT-legz &amp; amazing-skin!  Her humor/routine is ...:  &#39;ok&#39;.
I haven&#39;t found a female comedian yet..... nope still haven&#39;t..
Them legs though 😮
"Since &#39;snowflake&#39; was originally a term for triggered liberals, perhaps triggered conservatives need their own label.  Like, slowflakes."
THIS WHOLE SET WAS HILARIOUS
Not worth the time...
Her cadence reminds me of Nikki Glaser!
seriously not funny.
I’m Mexican and I’m offended how you guys censured the joke about our race . I didn’t know Comedy Central Is leaning to the left
My brother is in sight looking at the outside the kitchen window and he&#39;s saying it&#39;s not going to freeze tonight so
She is the BEST ...LOL .. i Loved her. This was Time Tested!! .. Nailed IT!! ..Thank you Amy
The best thing Anthony ever put in her mouth was his jokes
"Lol, from the opening monologue about her highschool crush, she went for it! XD This special is hilarious."
Very funny lady
Comedy what?
This was her pinnacle.  This entire show is hilarious!!  Then the REAL Amy Schumer came out and......
disgusting
"I went into this thinking she was definitely not as bad as people said<br><br><br><br><br><br>,but <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=150"">2:30</a> minutes in and she is so unfunny"
"If you can see, the downvote total is 3 times up upvotes. That&#39;s extraordinarily rare for a major or semi-major entertainer.<br>She&#39;s earned huge hatred.  Let me tell you, she wasn&#39;t born with that; she <i>earned</i> it.<br>Sarah Silverman too.  What a tragic waste of talent, in each case becoming some of the most hated when they could have each been hugely beloved."
She&#39;s NEVER been funny 🤷‍♂️
She is one of the best female comedians around. Her joke are real and nateral....and she has great legs!😊
Greta Thunberg is funnier.
"I haven&#39;t seen this in years.......the similarities between her and Nikki Glazer are insane. Timing, cadence, etc."
I love not watching her.
This woman is a waste of time and space.
Yeah a legendary joke thief and unfunny person
"Yeah, that is 100% a paid audience. I sat and watched this video for 6 minutes and not a single funny thing was said. These people were rolling out of their seats.."
Is she considered to be a comedian?  Really?!
"Amy, material and delivery:  A+"
You are the best. Rock on Amy
This is so funny
She&#39;s not funny at all!
Legend ? Half her material is stolen!!
She&#39;s horrible.....
They laughed at her when she left Saturday night to be a comedian. Nobody&#39;s laughing at her now!
Genius👍❤️
Love You!
I&#39;m not in to Asia women like that
😂😂😂😂.... Im not. Laughing at her jokes i am laughing at her 😂...
Hilarious!
Great set Amy
Boopasleep
Amy is hilarious and I love her
Not funny.
The First time I saw her I thought she seemed cute. Then... She opened her mouth .... Been downhill ever since.
Hack...
"She wishes......OLD, PREDICTABLE, UNFUNNY."
Funny stuff!
TRAITOR!
Unbelievably sick. Not sure why anybidy is laughing. Goodbye.
"31, she was expired"
Go Amy 😂
I like Amy.. ❤  her thinking is so sarcastic and revealing &amp; truthful.. a born comedian 😂❤😇😇
Love Amy 🤣🤣🤣
Ambian and drinking aint no joke. I woukd go to jail if i told you my experience.
I so love her.❤
I love women who talk frankly about sexuality. It&#39;s so refreshing
Really... legend?? I tried.  She&#39;s just not funny
It’s weird how Americans are not used  to foreskins. In Australia it’s more weird to be circumcised.
"George Carlin, legend, Richard Pryor, legend. Amy??? Please. Would have gone nowhere without Uncle Chucky."
What are these bots💀
Just because she gained weight recently.. doesn&#39;t  make her less funny or attractive because her truth makes her funny 😂❤
And if a man started off with a &quot;joke&quot; like that...............
"When Amy is heckled, she doesn&#39;t waste any time putting them in there place by Calling &quot;Security!&quot; 😮"
I LoveYou Amy❤
"Opinions differ, but she killed on this - her delivery and confidence? All of it! We can dislike when she&#39;s off but also admit when she&#39;s fire!"
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should this “thing” be cloned. Never ever EVER no matter what. Already enough clunts in this world.
It wasn&#39;t us who voted about the bush. lol I am thinking it was because women didn&#39;t want us to know their real hair color. lol
"You all beat me to the punch.. so I need to change it up..<br>     If someone thinks Amy Schumer is a legend..<br>   They should immediately lose their job, because that business has a walking liability.."
AMAZING AMY
"As a kid, Amy wanted to be a comedian.<br>Everybody was laughing.<br>Now she became a comedian.<br>Nobody is laughing now."
Legendary  joke thief.
Is this her older stuff? I found it funny her new stuff is too forced
So funny saying the guy 54 years married wanting to ask his wife new tricks and yes I have had a women tell me it&#39;s hard to be a woman
Shes improved. I remember her act being that woeful id get second hand embarrassment
She is so beautiful too
AMY 🤟 SMiley 😁
I like her...
So fn funny 😊😅
She was a hottie back in them olden days.
"Gonna be honest, I only came here to see the dislikes and comments."
"THIS AMY, BRING THIS AMY BACK. THIS IS HILARIOUS"
Booooooooooo😂
Amy Schummer and &quot;comedy legend&quot; should never be used together
Wow.. how to get out of fee&#39;s for a blood test.. just donate it.. they have to give you a reason why you&#39;re rejected..😂
❤ LOVE HER ❤
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=1938"">32:18</a> This guy really wants to hit it"
Takes a special type of person.  And what bothers me is that there are enough of these special people on the planet to full the audience.😢
SHE IS NOT THAT DAM FUNNY..
That explains a lot as you need to know she was at a lot of freak off parties of Diddy 🤢🤮
If this is her best performance I would hate to see her worst<br>There&#39;s got to be somebody holding up Cue Cards for the audience or maybe the laughter is just a recording?
The only thing Schumer&#39;s legendary for is stealing jokes.
6 K likes - 14 K dislikes
"Surely, to be a comedy legend you first have to be funny? Schumer has never been funny."
She&#39;s great!
Is there a save button around here?
"Fantastic show, the negative comments make no sense."
"Whomever is responsible for the PR campaign for Amy Shumer should be banned from anything comedy. She is awful, but apparently deeply connected."
All those negative critics apparently not having watched the video are most definitely 🇺🇸 ! No country’s got more hypocrites !
This is a perfect example why I don&#39;t like comedians.<br>Awful.
Amy schumer. Comedy legend........nice joke
A Legend  in her own mind &gt; what&#39;s left of it !!!
Peak Amy Schumer
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=117"">1:57</a> No thanks"
Enjoyed this very much.
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻
Ah that&#39;s brilliant.
"Amy, I hope you are doing better.🥂"
How old is this?
Never seen white female comedy like that.<br>It&#39;s well considered
"Oh,the joke thief😮"
Again🎉😂
not funny
she made me laugh at 11 minutes with the mark twain joke by accident. im so angry with my self.
"So good! It made my day. Ya, am French!"
@amy you look more awesome and sexy as usual! did you lose weight?
I&#39;d knock the back outta that
"A comedy special so bad, that despite it being an English-Speaking American, Comedy Central had to put it on a German-language channel<br>Nichts für ungut, Deutschland, aber du verdienst es nicht, mit Amy Schumer zusammen zu sein."
And she&#39;s the class of the family.
I Love how half of her jokes are stolen from others
"ooh, nice huge MUSHROOMS there, Amzzzze"
Legend?  That&#39;s a laugh
Really tough to be a comedian when you have no sense of humor
Ozempic still doesn’t make her funny
"Everyone&#39;s laughing, I wondering what&#39;s funny."
Hilarious
wow im inlove
The most UNFUNNY person on the planet.... 🙄
She makes me wanna be a black dude with a nickname!
BRO EVERY JOKE SHE SAYS “UM” BUD THEYRE SO AWKWARD YOU HAVE TO KEEP THE SENTENCE GOING💀💀💀
About as funny as jockeys piles 🙄
Schumer is the most unfunny person ever
"It&#39;s funny that a lot of haters come on here to bash her, they obviously thought enough of her to type her name in! This set is gold!"
I came here only to dislike. Carry on...
❤ She&#39;s awesome
SHe got wittle chubby toddler cheeks
SHE IS AWESOME <br>😂😂😂😂😂😂
She&#39;s about as funny as Covid.
I love Amy Schumer’s comedy! Be well Amy!
Naughty girl 😂
This Woman is sooo Hilarious!!!😅
Can&#39;t watch this.....I can&#39;t  stand her!!
Thumbs up: 7.2K<br><br>Thumbs down: 25.9K<br><br>That says it all!
Looking good. I&#39;m not hitting on you.
Simply Brilliant!
She steals other comedians material
She&#39;s a legend in your mind.
the LEAST FUNNY PERSON IN AMERICA
Comedy gold!!!!!!❤😂😅😊
"Marry me Amy,😍🤩😘😍🤩😘😍🤩😘❤️💃💐💪🔥🔥🔥🔥"
A legend in her own mind.
Hilarious lady!  😂
Where are the jokes?
The people really find this funny
I reckon the Cabbie is the winner…!!
Never could find her funny
She&#39;s hilarious
Pathetic excuse for comedy
"Amy was looking so good in this video, and as usual, soooooooo funny."
Worst nasty comedian EVER
REAL talent does not need to rely on f-bombs.
Was any of this supposed to be funny?
Who”” even is this. Bruh please 😂👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
Her timing is superb she’s the best
Your best set and when you looked awesome

Hilarious! Sooo funny
Smart and  intelligent!! The movie snatched with her and Goldie 😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
"This is from 2012.  Danke for posting it, very funny indeed."
"Great show, thank you"
You remember when youtube still showed the amount of dislikes? Youtube real garbage for removing that. They knew what they were doing
Amy is so gorgeous and funny ❤
Not funny at all. Waste of time.
Her racial jokes were refreshing 😅 she funny. I liked her other jokes too. Great work 😂
Your awesome 🎉😂😂😂😂🎉
Es gibt lustige shows und es gibt amy schumer
"It is so bad, where is the comedy?"
"Bridget, thank you for being so brave😂😂😂😂😂"
Look it&#39;s miss piggy
This is back when she was awesome
Wow her jokes are not funny.
Awesome 👌🏾 ❤
"Wow, Hot Amy!"
Now that’s talent <br>Amy is a goddess!
"Ok, Chuck is your uncle"
"look what youve become Amy, you cant be proud of this, this was an epic performance of bad taste."
Carroll Stravenue
"whose jokes did she steal, again?"
She&#39;s not funny at all
Beautiful and hilarious. I love this woman❤
"So here&#39;s a new concept,  comedy without any comedy 😮 i never laughed as much since  i had teeth pulled without anesthesia 😊"
haven&#39;t seen this for years.  it&#39;s still very funny.
How is she even popular?
So this passes for &quot;comedy&quot; today...   I laughed more the last time I watched C-Span.
aleopecia! ha ha ha
So funny.
Not at all funny. I tried!
"Solid set, prime Schumer"
The only consistencies in this video for me was my undying frown and look of disgust for the entire 41 minutes.
Brilliant 😂
Boring and obnoxious
"I noticed that she follows her script to the letter, regardless of what&#39;s really happening. That make some of her lines awkward.<br>&quot;Only clap if you mean it.&quot; - No one clapped.<br>And it was not the only case where she &quot;interacted&quot; with the audience like that.<br>I don&#39;t know, feels a bit too affected to me... There are more natural comedians, who actually react to what happens instead of pretending.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=1792"">29:52</a>. That&#39;s another example. A few laughs, no complains whatsoever. <br>And she: &quot;That&#39;s the one? &#39;Boo&#39; right?&quot; Umm... no?"
What a legend
Having suffered through this I can safely say 100% she is neither a legend nor a comedian.
She had a hot body back then.
"this tapes like 10 years old or more, she looked smokin hot back then. And this set just absolutely kills it. so funny."
"I really love comic comedies &amp; <br>stand up comedian’s like Tracy <br>Morgan, Jay Pharaoh, LL Cool J, <br>Mike Epps,  Arsenal Hall, George <br>Lopez, Eddie Murphy, Chris Tucker <br>Chris Rock, Will Smith &amp; Jada Pinket,  Tammy  pascatellie,  <br>Wanda Sykes, Katt Williams, <br> Janet Jackson &amp; Rihanna..."
She’s a legend now?
I&#39;m richer than her
I like her.
Worst human ever
Friggin funny! Love you!!!
legend?  LOLOLOL
hilarious? Give me a break
she ist just awful
"I&#39;ve never seen her look better and unlike most standips, she made me laugh."
Don’t care abt subject matter or particular words but being unfunnys a dealbreaker
Comedy.....legend....HER?
"She and Niki Glasser are so alike, though Nikki seems funnier by a bit. Both are bad."
Uncut is my favorite so it’s a happy surprise 🎉❤
Was this filmed 20 years ago?
"I guess she has never been funny,"
su unfunny it hurts
She&#39;s hilarious AF 😂
With a great set
"I don’t know why people hate on her, she’s honestly the funniest female comedian out there. Her jokes are creative and foward, and her timing is on point"
I guess it&#39;s American humor. Five minutes into the video and nothing funny so far.
amy love ya chic...lol.
Don&#39;t like
Yo I am crying filthy tears!!!! This is hilarious seriously🤣
Kinda not funny
I used to like Amy then as time passed it seems like she got Mean/ Bitter.
Kinda not funny
Hilarious😂😂
Me scouring the internet trying to find who actually wrote these jokes before Amy 😂😂💀💀
Women just aren&#39;t funny 🙄
"She&#39;s thin,!!!!"
Don’t understand people’s nasty comments. Just stop watching if you don’t like it
Ugh...
This is hilarious I have not stopped laughing
❤ The 🌿 !!!
I’m not here to tell anyone what to think is funny….but if you like whitty raunch I just can’t understand how anyone would not think she’s hysterical. This was her best set imo. Too funny.
"I so try to love her and i still go back to Joan Rivers and Griffin. I am so sorry, I tried."
My doctor put me on laughing gas while watching this. I haven&#39;t laughed.
makes me puke
"Her best show, ever! Hilarious!"
just not funny
Amy Schumer is about as funny as Hana Gadsby..
Ive seen worse
She was so brave to do this material while she was 7 months pregnant
Worst comedy show I&#39;ve ever seen. Her brother&#39;s band tortured us for eons in time for us to stumble around the stage with a bottle to finish with a tirade about the 2nd Amendment.
Legend? Amy Schumer?!? 😅🤣😬😂
No thanks
"She is phenomenal and indeed a Legend. I can&#39;t understand the American hate towards this Lady. She is just too good, look at all her work. 🇵🇹💯"
I thought iam going use slink shot I bot with .e  but sory I dont crak I did I n the cawche
Amy Schumer is a fantastic example of a woman who is at peace with her own sexuality. Thanks for supporting women&#39;s rights Amy. We need to stop feeling ashamed of being sexual creatures. Men have had the right to be openly sexual for generations. It&#39;s time for us to enjoy the same freedoms.
creepy
Worst “comedian” button
She looks great but how recent or old is this video?
I find her absolutely repellent.
So thin
Cool!
not funny
Great finish ! 😂
Amy Schumer is a comedy legend???? On what planet????
Crude but cute. Very funny 😆
this looks like &gt;10yrs old. she doesn&#39;t look anything like this now
Absolutely hilarious show! Thank you Amy ❤
Ugh
"Meh~~ her jokes are awkward. Really nothing funny about it, 5 min into it and I already want to quick. If someone told me that she is pregnant “what you gonna do” isn’t funny, what would be funny is “you know who’s the father?”"
“Mostly sexual stuff” because that’s mostly what female comedians talk about. Talk about a stereotype…..Amy is it! Just like her dad in his own way.
Amy i love you 😂😂😂😂❤
On what planet is this a comedy?!
Luv luv luv this woman!! 😂😅😂
She&#39;s still got great legs. Beautiful even though her comedy is a bit off
She’s so cute !!
I like Amy... Cute &amp; funny... Sarcastic and truthful..and she turned that into funny..❤😇
Wär nicht nötig gewesen.
"Ok, so whos jokes were these originally"
Ammi Ammi you are gorgeous and beautiful and very very funny  I love you to bits. Sweetie pie 😂
"Comedy was decent, but those legs kept me GLUED!!! lol"
Talentless… so disappointed what passes for comedy these days
She is NO comic legend.
Upvote this to express your disliking.
Hey guys I made it threw the whole set and kept a straight face
Amy Schumer is NOT a comedy legend.<br>Lucille Ball is a COMEDY LEGEND.<br>Carol Burnett is a COMEDY LEGEND.<br>Amy Schumer is a comedienne and an actress.
You are awesome
Speziell aber ich mags
This is 10 years old?  Doesn&#39;t seem like it.
"Sorry Amy, 3 min in and not a single funny thing. I tried"
She is the female version of Brenden Schaub
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=1077"">17:57</a> - nope."
"The title of the video is the joke, Right?  ……. Right?"
she’s actually pretty funny i laughed
common Amy Schumer L💀🪑
Great show Amy
"So, this video has 6.7k likes and 22k dislike as for today 8th of november 2023. I wonder why 😀"
Nice show Amy.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=49"">0:49</a>, here"
"I watched this whole thing and the entire time, I felt bad... like I&#39;d slowed down in front of a bad car accident that left bumper to bumper congestion for miles behind me. You know when you pretend to be have been cautious, considerate passers by but they&#39;re really just waiting to see if the engine blows up before EMS arrive? I think EMS made it, but i haven&#39;t decided yet if the wreckage was salvaged 😂"
Original air date??
"Great delivery, great crowd. What more could you ask."
Imagine being a man and going to an Amy Schumer show. Low T.
She is GREAT!!!!!!
Always this girl was single that would marry her
should open with it. <br><br>didn&#39;t catch that till 3rd or 4th time I watched. <br>Ame&#39;s a badass.
She&#39;s stolen so many jokes. There&#39;s a video here on YouTube where a guy picks her apart. Not so legendary.
Wow - she is absolutely not funny at all !
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=906"">15:06</a> AMY AT THE VEIN"
Painful to watch.
Love her
She&#39;s so hilarious
She has the most beautiful eyes
Awesome ❤❤❤
Painful to watch like always
Perfect timing
I lasted 5 minutes.. didn&#39;t make me laugh at all .<br>I just heard her name and wanted to check it out <br>Oh well.
What a brilliant comedienne. 🇬🇧
Wait how are people laughing
She&#39;s very funny! People who don&#39;t think she&#39;s funny usually hate women and humor directed to an audience who is evolved enough to appreciate what contributions women have made to our society. If you don&#39;t like it- turn the channel or turn it off!
Is &quot;bathroom attendant&quot; some new term for bog troll?
Calling Amy Schumer a legend is like calling her uncle an American patriot
Who is this ?😮😮😮
I wonder how many of those jokes she stole.
If Mario Bath was a woman
I laughed a lot. Good show. She is good.
She commented on Derek ...made me giggle..now I  gotta humble her back.
Amy. The MASTER. <br>Thank you Queen! More more more MORE. ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥😂😂😂
Brilliant.
This is sooo not funny.....😞
Perfect legs to go with everything else.
This chick is so funny. Loved this.
😴
That couple gets in a fight on the way home over his brown coat 😂😂😂
She&#39;s about as funny as Trevor noah
What a sweetheart!
You look fantastic but free gaza
Love you Amy!
The longer I watched the more depressed I got
You crack me the fuck up Amy
I&#39;m Derrick lol
Amy Schumer is hilarious AF ❤😂
Comedy LEGEND....not hardly.
You are just beyond funny grrl...
A+ 🎉
She’s looking so good. 😊
Have you ever had a fgm girl friend.
First time hearing of and tuning in with Amy. I love certain comedy and must say I&#39;ll be tuning in more. Amy is too funny and among my top Favorite Comedians 🤣
ish
Amy Schumer + Comedy Legends – gutes Beispiel einer Text-Bild-Schere.
Ozempic Has done her well.
"I haven&#39;t found a real funny comedian in a long time, Amy genuinely Made me laugh a Lot. Loved it."
Texas or somewhere I’m not going
She’s just adorable 😍
❤
Didn&#39;t know she was that hilarious.😎
Booo
I feel like I&#39;ve just found my new favourite comedian
Give me my time back!
She is funny and a good entertainer
😐
"She was absolutely right about the chick whose parents were murdered in front of her. Back then, sometimes we didn’t even know where our parents went because they took them away and killed them without us even knowing about it."
Man.....so many talented female xomedians........but that schumer lady just isn&#39;t one of them. 🤷‍♂️
I liked her a lot! This was truly funny imo. What is with the totally incorrect like/dislike stats? As of this viewing it is 4.7K yay vs 12.0K nay? A 28.9% rating? That simply can&#39;t be right!
👎👎
A legend?  In what ignorance or eating too much?
😢
Why is she always copying someone?
I lost a bet
"Back when Amy was funny, and didn&#39;t think we all wanted to her her opinions on everything."
These bots are working overtime
"Amy Schumer during 2020 is when I noticed how naturally funny she sounds. And, she&#39;d likely believe when Others say &quot;they won&#39;t do it in your mouth&quot;, then of course, it happens accidentally. And the crowd loves it. Go down. Amy. <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/G8AfY6yWGuKuhL0PlbiA2AE""></a>"
hey Amy can we go out on a date?
AHHHH<br>Amy the GOAT when it comes to joke thieves.She has stolen jokes from the greats like Patrice Oneal and Kathleen Madigan.She mostly focuses on being a democrat booster these days.
So unfunny its legendary
Im curious for all the people that dont like her who do they find funny?
That was before she had a kid
thanks your looking great
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=1478"">24:38</a> is that rose leslie?"
How old is this show? She looks so young here.
not remotely funny
gahba
"I drive a 🚕 toooooook, 😉😘"
♥
Amy is my love! u r the funniest next-door girl i have ever met)
disgusting.  child sexual abuse is not funny.
She&#39;s been better 😊
She&#39;s a legend like Biden&#39;s a great president!!
For the people who cant see dislikes its right now at 12k
"Looks, if at all"
Love this
At least the comments are funny and original
Çool🎉
Puelca
"raaaaaaw, Amy, LOL"
"My favs <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=390"">6:30</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=423"">7:03</a>."
Sad songs
cute shoes
"I thought it was comedy legends,Amy Schumer doesn&#39;t  rate"
Gash
That was too funny😐
"She is GREAT!  Is stuff missing, IMDB has it at 61 minutes in  2012?"
"GREAT COMEDY, CUTE GIRL❤"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=66"">1:06</a><br>Freudian slip ?  🤔<br>She outed herself as a Hollywood kid diddler !"
Nice shoes
Is this supposed to be funny?
Super!!
😅😂😅
I thought you where moving.
What makes it a legend?
Im surprised hes still alive after being crushed by her
She crazy !
Now that was funny
Not funny😊
Free Palestine…
😂😂😂😂😂
Easiest try not to laugh challenge ever. 🥱
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=490"">8:10</a>"
Sleaze Legend
Don&#39;t shave
😂
"I hate her personality and she&#39;s never once made me laugh. There are loads of hilarious, brilliant, talented female comics and she&#39;s not even in the same universe."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=1084"">18:04</a>"
❤
This is great. Amy looks just like my High School Girlfriend. It isn&#39;t very hard to imagine what she&#39;s rockin&#39; under that miniskirt.
I love it! Finally someone is talking about s@x. In these times when people are mother Theresa.
"You&#39;re far from mediocre, Amy. Ya looking amazing"
American humour... English or Dutch comedies from the 50s are less lame and corny than this. I literally couldn&#39;t watch it.
amy shumer
"To answer the bush question, I myself don’t care abt looking around in some bushes, to find where I need to put my tongue, it’s nasty too, on the flip side of that coin, I don’t expect any women to do the same, so I keep my stuff clean shaved as well."
Outstanding 😂
Have you seen her face lately 😮
☺️
Great set by a beautiful girl
what a dissapointment! someone who insults her mom and kids publicly!
Comedy &quot;LEGENDS&quot;?
I mean look at her
She is funny 😁
Why would you think a uncircumcised man was weird? - surely if anything it is natural to have that skin rather than to have it removed for religeous or health reasons.
I don’t get why people think this is funny.
Go Amy!
Amy Schumer is about as funny as a car accident
In HER own mnd
When vulgarity pretends to be comedy...
cc cc   ccc ni the first time 😅😮😮😅😅😅😊❤
This is the best set she&#39;s ever done and it sure is terrible.
Put her on by mistake glad I only listen to 14 seconds.
Thank-you algorithm
Yall read the whole Bible when yall get a chance
The backs been knocked outta that years ago!😂😂
How is it even possible to be this annoying
"Amy the greatest... <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=635"">10:35</a>"
"One of the lowest comedians.  Trite, poor humor."
Way to hustle girl .
This freak is no legend not even close
😂😅🤣
She has lost weight
Amy you are so awesome!!! Your legs are absolutely gorgeous as well as the rest of your body...😋
😂😂😂❤
"So sad, listening to her... you could  be forgiven if you thought women weren&#39;t funny."
Absolutely the worst comedian ever!
😂😅😂😂😂😂❤
Unfunniest comedian in the biz
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=577"">9:37</a>"
Didn&#39;t. . .laugh. . . once.
Hilarious
❤😂
👏🏼😂👏🏼😂👏🏼
Video is hilarious!!!!!
✨🙌🏻💝
"It&#39;s amazing comedy, except for some of the racism, when it starts to feel like: we all think this, and it&#39;s true and cool.... if it&#39;s like we are all like this, and it is terrible and savage, yes, I am having a great time..... I wonder how other folks experience it......<br>otherwise, brilliant irony and sarcasm...."
Uh she is not a legend.
🤣🤣
I Love The Bush !!!
Amy shows you don&#39;t need an ounce of talent to try and be a comedian
100% 😂
Her timing is out .
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=1625"">27:05</a> my guy just started rethinking his life decisions"
Wow the most UNfunny thing ive ever seen. Comedy Legends! Thats click bait.
Not a legend
She&#39;s looking cute lately
Steals jokes.
Kisses
"Wenn das Licht in der Disko angeht und da sind noch Frauen, heisst das bei uns: Restefick"
"No. Just no. That is completely, absolutely, curse words unacceptable. I change my socks too... 🤣🤣"
Then if you want to go to Disney world
Carbie back at it
Her comedy grates!
I kept this playing for more than 20 minutes. I&#39;m depressed.
Woke has been
Waste of life
I thought the comedy legends series was about funny comedians?
She took the funny out of funny 0.0 rate as a whatever she is..
National  Fixed League. !!!!!!
I tried to laugh.           It didn&#39;t happen.
"Maybe it&#39;s just my upbringing, but it&#39;s bad form to categorize men in regards to your stinky star and not let us see it so that we know which pigeonhole (yah...no?  it&#39;s funny) you&#39;re placing us (me)."
lame and boring
"Amy ,I&#39;m free tonight,what you doin&#39;?"
amazing  LOVE YOU AMY
"A legend? No, she is actually exists. She is an unfunny stand up &quot;comedian&quot;, which she has in fact managed to make work against herself. But legend? No; barely an  anecdote."
Just not funny. Always the same topics constantly used by female comedians.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=316"">5:16</a> Yeah, let&#39;s joke about aborting babies, not 🚫, I&#39;m out, ✌️"
This is old. .. Before she started stealing material from other comedians .
One of the funniest  comedian out there.👏👏😂😂
"Ok, so let’s get one thing clear…we used to have a single word: comedienne to express what the ‘politically correct’ numbskulls now use two words for: ‘female comedian’! Go figure…"
Well Mark Twain was his pen name so.....
“ Great “
"Welcome to the modern women, sad isn&#39;t it, but true...<br>It would be great to get back to having morals...<br>Yes, I know it&#39;s Comedy, but it&#39;s right on the money at least for California, and literal girls..."
Very old tape
Sick
Comedy legends with this dummy Gove me a break
"Ok everybody, calm down, calm down. #1 comedy legend?😂😂😂😂 No!!"
She’s so horrible.
Comedy legend is a massive stretch...she stole from Patrice O&#39;Neal
Who let baby face from happy death day make “comedy”
Horrible sorry not funny. Amy is to comedy what Albert Fish is to gymnastics.
Beautiful and funny....😍🤣😍
😮😊 am😊😊😊😊
Why are people laughing this is so bad this just proves that you neither have to be funny nor have a sense of humour
never heard of her and she is special.
she was kinda funny when she first appeared but NOW  i think she has lost  that edge i find her  bland
I was waiting for the jokes....
"If this woman ever came up with some original jokes, they were the ones that weren&#39;t funny."
Take a note from jimmy carr..... Actually be funny.
Funnest I have heard in years .
Love Amy!
why does the industry try and gaslight us into believing this hog is a comedic legend?
"Okay so, I’ve briefly flicked over comments and they were mostly negative. I’ll start my review by saying that I don’t, and never have particularly liked American humour (except Eddie Murphy). I stumbled across this video and started to watch and must admit, I found Amy to be the funniest American I’ve ever listened to! Found myself laughing out loud most of the way through. I’m now an Amy Schumer FAN! 👏🏼 👏🏼 👏🏼"
A huge fan ...she is serving legs on this
Stop deleting the negative comments
Unfunny joke stealer!
Whooo❓️❓️❓️
Amy a comedylegend??? 😂😂😂😂😂
Sorry.... Not Funny
This is so bad 😂
better
She is very funny
You are just as funny as George Carlin.
Fun to look at but NOT funny!
"Even though I’ve heard these jokes by people who are better at telling them, this is still kinda ok"
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjJKQ7tEdLQ&amp;t=1752"">29:12</a>   ROFL😂😂😂"
Amy Schumer is beautiful on stage 😍 ❤
So unfunny 🤮
Jewish
Legend - more like ran through...
Isn’t she supposed to be funny???
Most of her jokes are probably stolen from a bad meme compilation
Wasn’t funny at all.
So she used to be funny huh?  What happened?  She almost never makes me laugh anymore!   I really kind of dread her now.
😐
"Uhhh, she is terrible"
She is not only beautiful but hilarious also ❤❤❤❤ Love her
amy the zionist
RACIST women
This is so unfunny! 🙏
What a turn off?
"a real person and a comedian, the best. thank you"
Why are the audience laughing tho.
Die frau sollte nie wieder eine plattform geboten bekommen
Not funny at all
She was awesome until she went political! Then she bottomed out!
Pim
This isn’t bad. I chuckled. Just vulgar from a woman’s view. I get it.
I WISH WOMAN WOULD STOP SHAVING DOWN BELOW
Isn&#39;t she known for stealing jokes?
😂 i wish i was in front roll she is Beautiful two.
🥰
Lizzo really let herself go
i saw her first time in some roast... she is amazing
She isn’t funny. She’s just a joke.
Who is this Amy Schumer?
Amy is really funny!
Worst &quot;comedian&quot; ever!
She is the worst
Open Racist. How is she not cancelled
She is Carlos M... in a skirt.
Least unfunny person I’ve ever seen
double standards
and THAT&#39;S how you do it !!
😂😂😂😂😂
"The only female comedian  know is the  one from Sky News Austrailia, and she is just speaking facts."
Through this hole video the only time I smiled is when it was over
Wonder if this kinda humor would work if a guy said it.
She is a babe and too smart for me...wonderful
"Extremely Vulgar, yet claims to be Gods chosen."
Was some of this supposed to be funny?
worst actor of all time
But she isnt funny  the funniest part is i watched  the whole think and didn&#39;t laugh  i really really wanted to though
Hope she saved all the money she made cuz her 15 minutes come and gone.
"8.2k thumbs up, 26k thumbs down"
Nothing funny about her at all!!!!!!
"<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI""></a> MY EYES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Not funny
She needs serious help and hopefully she turns out to be hellen keller
It tuned out it was all one big lie.
Not funny
"Ungefähr so lustig, wie Gebärmutterhalskrebs. <br><br>Danke."
Worst comedian I’ve ever seen my ears are actually bleeding
I bet Amy could rock the world ❤
She destroyed Spanish in one single swoop
"Puerto Rican from the Bronx here, this cringy shit almost made my soul leap out of my body."
"For anyone curious, the Rules of the House of Representatives require that all remarks be recorded in English"
"She means &quot;I&#39;m Puerto Rican when I needs your votes, dummies&quot;."
She thinks she&#39;s in a movie.
She worked hard to memorize that one liner.
I can sniff the narcissism about a mile away.
As a Puerto Rican this makes me feel ashamed and embarrassed 😬 I feel like dying of cringe
I bet she says &quot;muchas gracias&quot; to the waiter at a Mexican restaurant
Even as a Mexican... I need a translation.  🤣
I think Spanish speakers need a translation😂😂
PUERTO RICAN FROM FLORIDA HERE. SHE MAKES ME WANT TO THROW UP!!!!
Even her “abuela” thought that was cringe.
she does not speak for all Puerto Ricans across the World.
She&#39;s no Boriqua. We pulled her puertorican card years ago. She what we now call a lost coconut 🥥 😏.
"No soy de ascendencia latina pero puedo entender lo que dijo. No puedo creer que en un país con una densidad tan alta de hispanohablantes se necesite una traducción de algo tan simple.<br><br>El español ha sido obligatorio en Chevy Chase, condado de Montgomery, Maryland, en todas las escuelas públicas desde el 4º hasta el 12º grado. En casa hablaba japonés con mi familia y español con nuestras niñeras, jardineros, cocineros, amas de casa, en la escuela hablaba inglés y español.

En general, más personas deberían hablar varios idiomas porque su perspectiva se ampliará, comprenderá el mundo de diferentes maneras y fomentará la riqueza cultural en la forma en que se identifican. Debería ser una norma social enseñar tu idioma de herencia a amigos que no pueden hablar tu idioma.<br><br>Ayudo a los estadounidenses de origen japonés a encontrar a sus familiares y los cementerios familiares de sus familiares, enseño el idioma y la cultura japonesa antes de su visita.

Estos niños no se odian entre sí cuando son adultos.<br><br>Los niños pueden aprender cualquier cantidad de idiomas e instrumentos y no confundirlos. Si se exponen diferentes idiomas desde los 4 a los 12 años, podrán hablarlos con acento nativo hasta que mueran.

She can begin by helping her Grandmother in Puerto Rico.
She looks so proud of herself.  I wonder how many times she practiced that.
Fact is she does not represent Puerto Rico in  Congress. That role belongs to Jennifer Gonzalez elected by the people of the island.
I can’t stand her
As I a  Puerto Rican  I barely survived the cringe
Wow. Reading some of these comments. I never knew the Puerto Rican community had such a low esteem for AOC.
The Puerto Rican community does not clain her.
AOC is gorgeous in any color.
"As a Puertorican, NY can keep her."
“We can land on the sun. We’ll just go at night.” AOC.
I am Puerto Rican but I won&#39;t vote for her if she was the last person in this 🌎
"Anyone noticed how at the start of the shorts, the caption read AOC and then (R) New York?<br><br>For those of you who are clueless, R indicates Republican, D indicates Democrat."
Who keeps voting her in.  What an embarrassment to her constituents.
She also thinks she&#39;s black.
"As a former bartender, AOC DOES bring something to the table:  lots of boos."
That made my head hurt.
As a Latina I find she tries so hard to make people think she&#39;s a Latina.
I’m French and I’m still more Puerto Rican than AOC
She practiced all week to learn that phrase.
Being Puerto Rican this is cringey 🙄
"I am Puerto Rican, and I know many Puerto Ricans from NYC. Very few Puerto Ricans I know like or identify with AOC or what she represents. In many ways, she is far more part of the political establishment than she is an advocate for the people. I am not quite clear on what she has actually done for her constituents relative to her outsized political profile. Her REAL constituents appear to be the political party she fund raises for."
"Why do politicians find the job duties so hard to follow ? They are sent to REPRESENT their constituents,  NOT the world !"
She&#39;s so out of touch. I&#39;m a white and I can tell how cringe this is
She’s one of the worst representatives ever
"As an Indian , i support Puerto Ricans in their birth right to disown AOC. Cheers 🥂"
"Wow sooooooo embarrassing, she shouldn’t be allowed to say that… absolutely not a representative of Puerto Rican people!!!!!!"
As a Puerto Rican raised and born in Puerto Rico I feel embarrassed by this woman who doesn’t even what she is talking about. 😢
Vote her out! Vote her out! Vote her out! Make America Great🇺🇸
🙃🤡🌎<br>We have become the laughing stock of every nation because of the clowns.
"I’m also PUERTO RICAN, please begin by stating all your accomplishments"
“I was a barmaid and was born in the USA.  For some reason I feel I have the right to speak for all Puerto Ricans….” Sit down miss AOC.
She said something about sending more weapons to Israel to score some AIPAC points
"As a Hispanic she’s a shame.  They have totally thrown away the real meaning of the quote of the great MLK “I look to a day when people will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.” Go figure that out."
"Quality people are busy with real jobs and a real life. Politicians seem to be what’s leftover. Slackers,<br>Liars, thieves, with treasonable agendas. <br>Throw them all out. Start a new."
"Translation is, citizens of NY are paying my dumb ass $174,000 to be this incompetent."
What a disgrace to boricuas
"Well bless her heart, it only took 3 weeks to memorize those lines."
"&quot;I am Puerto Rican so that you know.&quot; Well, I&#39;m not Puerto Rican so that you know, AOC. Whatbwas the point of that declaration?"
"I was born in Cuba, left in 1962, grew up in Puerto Rico and I&#39;m a very proud American...I have to say, she is an embarrassment!  Besides I never heard of Yorktown Heights, the place where she grew up being in Puerto Rico..."
It’s extremely embarrassing someone like AOC can get elected to Congress. 🤦🏻
Half  those people cannot locate Puerto Rico in the map.
"It has nothing to do with being Puerto Rican, it has everything to do with integrity."
Translation: I have absolutely no clue what I&#39;m doing.
"That&#39;s (D) from New York, not (R). Media doesn&#39;t have standards anymore..."
Identity politics is her main tool.
We Puerto Ricans disagree with you. Sopla nuca
People actually voted for her? Wow
Why does she have an (R) next to her name that identifies her political party? Shouldn&#39;t it be a (D)?
They should have an IQ test before people get the vote
Trump 2024🇺🇸🇵🇷🇮🇱🇺🇸🇵🇷🇮🇱🇺🇸🇵🇷🇮🇱
I thought she&#39;s gonna say &quot;I wanna thank me for believing in me &quot; 😂😂
Never been so embarrassed to see someone say they’re Puerto Rican 😩😩
You would think a country so successful would know multiple languages on average but they’re strength comes from their military power not the educational system
"English is required to be spoken in all official US Government settings by US staff, representatives, military, etc. Exemptions include examples in official reports as appropriate, translators, etc."
She&#39;s the definition of fake
She doesn’t know what she said in English let alone Spanish.
Wow 100% hate commwnts for a hardworking representative who was fairly elected and has never hidden her background. Seems sus.
As a Boricua I am ashamed that she&#39;s representing us in Congress.
"As a puertorrican, I can tell you FOR SURE, that she doesn’t represent what we are."
Who are the people that are voting for her?!?!
"You dont speak for this boricua , 👎🏾"
This is a requirement under Congressional record-keeping rules. They will not transcribe foreign languages--the member of Congress has to provide a translation.
AOC is ridiculous.
She came back and said “yo quero Tacobell” while chewing gum and creating some distraction. AOC is a joke!!😂
How do you say stupid beotch in Spanish? 😂😂😂😂
So much arrogance from this one it&#39;s incredible
Hee Haw Hee Haw !
"&quot;Look here, I want the Latin vote.&quot;"
I think i&#39;ll move to Japan and make them change their language to English because I moved there.
She&#39;s a woke Democrat not a Republican!
My step dad is Puerto Rican and I’m more Puerto Rican than AOC.
What an embarrassment.
Translation: &quot;I hope you buy my bullshit because I don&#39;t have two brain cells to rub together.&quot;
"Her usual ridiculous behavior. The official language of all business conducted in the United States Congress, is English. Completely out of line."
"As a Latino immigrant to this blessed land , never felt or fell represented in any way shape or form by this BORICUA!"
They act like they&#39;re so amazed that she spoke in a different language.. these people are completely ignorant
Yes im the true identity PERCY LEE BROWN JR
Ridiculous  she needs to get voted out
How could anyone mislabel her political party?
I’m not a congressman but I feel like English should still be the primary language used when addressing Untied States Congress.
Just to clarify - she&#39;s a Democrat not a Republican
Embarrassing
She&#39;s definitely no Republican.
&quot;Don&#39;t call me gentle.  Gentle I&#39;m not.&quot;
She is a credit to Puerto Ricans and the texans that she helped after republiclans let freeze.
"There are plenty of other portoricans that don’t give a shit about what you are, pa que tú lo sepas."
This type of thing just creates a separation between us latinos and the rest of the American populous.
"As a Puerto Rican, I thought she was part Mexican this whole time."
She speaks ebonics in Spanish...it&#39;s &quot;street&quot; spanish
Jesus Christ how are we voting people like this into power. It is sickening
Is she Spanish or Latino? She is speaking Spanish like she is taking it in high school.
I’m white as can be and she sounded just like me when I try and speak Spanish.
I&#39;m ashamed to call myself a Puerto Rican with her as a representative
I am sick of her pandering and shaming America.
She is not a Republican.
Forgive my righteousnesses queens i love you 😊❤
I will never understand how people like this are elected to public office to serve the American People.  It’s disgusting.
For those of you who couldn’t understand she said “I’m in America but feel the need to speak a foreign language to feel like a cool person”
Boy she Loves to hear herself talk! She&#39;s so proud of herself!
I lose braincells Everytime I listen to her😜
She needs to translate the Spanish to actual spanish.
Baby hang in there your husband is on the way
"Could you imagine a elected official from another country going to there country’s senate or parliament or whatever and say “yo soy boriqua” , she would get laughed out of the building.<br><br>Only here you can exclaim your from some other country (regardless of territory status) while working for the people of another country 😮"
"She said. “I am Puerto Rican, and I’m a communist”"
For someone who has an Economics degree she really is ignorant of how an economy works. Someone should check into Boston University and what they&#39;re teaching.....
Welp folks ...... Any other questions about WTF is wrong with our Congress?  We did it to ourselves.
"Well, sixty-three million of us Americans understand what she said."
she said &quot;I put a piece of bread in the microwave and pushed potato on the buttons but it was still bred when it came out&quot;⚡
"Y los Latinos estamos asqueados de su conducta, usa su nacionalidad cuando le conviene. Le deveria dar vergüenza. Para que usted lo sepa!"
"Studies have shown, even 2 minutes of listening to AOC speak can cause irreparable brain damage."
Asking AOC to provide a translation isn&#39;t such a great thing. That woman thinks soy milk is Spanish for &quot;I am milk&quot;
We speak English as our priority language in this country so all words spoken in the chamber should be spoken in English for all to interpret and understand.
"I&#39;m ashamed. Being myself a Puerto Rican, she does NOT represent me. Whatsoever. Full stop."
I speak English and Spanish and I have no idea what the hell she said.
New York city please remove aoc from congress
She&#39;s a baddie so I&#39;ll let it slide. 👀
"Representatives from all different background should speak their mother tongue and take another vaccine booster, and open their houses for homeless people."
"PENDAHA,"
I love this woman so much !!!! She never stops fighting for all us she is so strong !!
I’m Puerto Rican and almost downed in my seat of embarrassment after what she just said 🙃
American politics should be for the American people not people of another nation.
"As a Spanish interpreter, the courteous thing to do is, say it again in English. Bad manners to alienate English speakers."
AOC the only waitress that brings nothing to the table..
"In 1960, John Kennedy himself received a financial aid offer from the Israeli lobby for his presidential campaign. He decoded Abraham Feinberg’s proposal for his journalist friend Charles Bartlett in the following terms: &quot;We know your campaign is in trouble. We’re willing to pay your bills if you’ll let us have control of your Middle East policy.&quot; Bartlett recalls Kennedy’s promise that &quot;if he ever did get to be President, he was going to do something about it [4].&quot; Between 1962 and 1963, he submitted seven campaign finance reform bills but all were defeated by the influential groups they sought to restrain."
Imagine if a republican spoke in Hebrew.
Hell yeah she has brought shame to PR’s!!!!!!!! To hear her say Yo Soy Boricua I cringed man! True story man!!! She’s a Minnie Mouse politician who can’t stay off of social media.
"AOC, can you say &quot;privilege&quot;?<br>If someone went up there and said something in French, or Latin, and then just smirked rather than translating, would the &quot;gentlelady&quot; expect them to translate?"
"I love you, AOC... The world can&#39;t wait to have you as the next US President!"
They even placed her in the wrong party
Ok? And?  What does being Puerto Rican have to do with her job?
Shouldn’t she be calling herself an American to unify the country instead of making divisions?
get rid of  AOC
CRINGE...UGHHHH
Why do we have to put everything in Spanish for immigrants? When I immigrated to the USA I didn’t speak ANY English and I had to learn quick because I didn’t have luxury of getting EVERYTHING provided to me in Russian nor did I expect it.
This woman is an embarrassment.
"On a Sunday she was a bartender, on the Monday she’s on the House floor. Wtf?"
You Speak English in that house !
Giving Latinos a bad name Desde 2019<br>Q triste
Taco taco burrito burito
She does nothing for her Voting Area.
She is such an embarrassment
What was the purpose for this?
"Yes Madam Speaker; Translation - I’m ten gallons of stupid in any language, and yield back my seat for more worth Senate Candidate."
Who ever did the caption at house must not know that AOC is a (D) Democrat not a (R) Republican
To get their vote.  One day minorities will see through this BS.
"As a Hispanic, who tf cares if you’re hispanic in government. It shouldn’t matter. What should matter are credentials and your benefit to the nation"
she. is. so. annoying.!!!!!!!!
Man reading these comments even you Puerto Ricans don’t want her ass😂😂😂🫡
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 😵‍💫🥴🥴 Embarrassing human
Shes rude and looks down at Americans
She&#39;s not a &quot;republican&quot; she&#39;s a Democrat.
The native tongue of Congress is English.
Yes baby i am silly you ...
She confirms so many puerto rican stereotypes.  Que vergüenza!
Her translation was incorrect. I’ll do it for her.<br><br>Correct translation: “I am Puerto Rican and I’m an idiot”.
The lady behind is cracking up hysterically
Don&#39;t judge her Spanish just from these short sentences. Watch her interviews entirely in Spanish and you&#39;ll really see how poorly she speaks Spanish.
I like how it was nice and quiet when she left...
"Half breed here 👋, that doesn’t speak Spanish, I also cringed."
She wanted people to applaud her 👏
We get it. She&#39;s Trying to Piss off all the Republicans. And it works.
LOL someone give AOC a Spanish lesson 😅
Puerto Ricans across the world ?? and they say this ?? ... Congress said: &quot;you have to &#39;splain your jibberish.&quot;
Wow! As a Puerto Rican I feel embarrassed by AOC  grandstanding and pandering  closing statement. Smh!
I think our government acts like they are in a play on Broadway. Their theatrics are so friggin ridiculous!
The people that got her elected must be beyond proud.
Lord Help us. We have people like her leading this country. We are going to have to have a miracle😢
She reminds me of that one girl in class who raises her hand and waves it for every single question but always gives the wrong answer.
She thought she was so badass even though she said it entirely wrong in grammar and tone. And whats crazy is she is still gonna win re-election at any given time.
That&#39;s is just a taste of what is coming
She&#39;s frightening. Had nightmares of her yelling at me... then she started chasing me. She&#39;s angry
As a Puerto Rican woman who also very proud to be an American … I can hear our ancestors… screaming “Oy Vey “ …. You can keep her New York… you deserve her!!!!
I&#39;m so tired of politicians pandering to Latinos in the US by speaking Spanish.
Yeah we deal in Anglais Senorita.
As 99% of NYC puerto ricans what did she say? We dont speak Spanish 😂😂😂
"oh please, when is AOC going to just go away?"
"&quot;(R) New York&quot;<br>Hmm, I sense an error."
"No matter how many times they ask her to provide a translation, she keeps saying it in Spanish"
"My question is, what is she doing that her district keeps voting her into office?"
The biggest problem with elected officials is they are not qualified.  Imagine electing surgeons to their jobs or pilots.
Yo SI quiero Tus votos -- I translated that.      So you KNOW.      She practice that phrase.      Hey abuelita is still waiting for help to fix her roof
Alexandria Ocasio Cortez: Defender of the people!
Why does it say she’s republican?
I’d love to see her speak Spanish to Spanish speakers 😂
"Congress: Lady, translation please.<br>AOC went on Twitter: Please turn on cc (subtitle) ....for Spanish.....Espanol.....Lmao 🤣"
"As a proud Puerto Rican who loves this nation, she isn’t someone we associate with."
She’s a phony thru and thru
Puerto Ricans are Not stupid. They know she’s begging
She can&#39;t get English straight nor Spanish.
"We wait with baited breath for her utterances, and then she says this."
That chick has to go. She is a bartender and is nothing but a bartender still
Disgusting!  Not my vote!!!😂
She’s so simple minded! Amazing that people actually voted for her
She thinks she a rock star.
She&#39;s a mess
She’s insane
I would like AOC so much more if she didn’t bring up all the stupid identitatian bullshit all the time. It’s very divisive.
She Single handedly.. made me not want to invest in Porto Rico.. 🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮and distroyed a beautiful language.. thank god for German 😂😂🇩🇪🇩🇪🇩🇪
"Good job New York, you elected this person twice."
I don’t know where in the hell she learned Spanish
More like the demon lady
"She only cares about other foreigners, NOT We the People, Nation as a Whole, or our Constitution!"
So proud of her speaking in a complete sentence. Give her a cookie.
Disgrace to America. Disgrace to humanity.
She acts like spanish is not being taught in grade schools.
That poor ignorant woman can not even speak Spanish correct in that short phrase she said. It&#39;s painful to pay taxes to pay her salary.
"So proud, been working on that speech since she was first elected"
go back
"another episode of word salad , makes no sense at all. we need to get her out of office !"
They certainly hired a bad actress in AOC.
That AOC woman is proof that there are Good Women &amp; There are those who Embarrass Good Women 🙄
A legend in her own mind.
how in Gods name is she still in congress?
Booooo 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
She’s truly has the Iq of a stop sign
No wonder puertorican can&#39;t gain their independence
&quot; THEY&#39;RE STILL DRINKING WATER OUT OF THE TOILETS ! &quot;    &quot; AT MY CONDO ! &quot;
"You know, she stayed up all night memorizing that line. And repeated all morning. 😂😂"
"If you love Puerto Rico so much, go live there."
Resign! 😤😤😤
Obnoxious
She might be the worst to ever hold a seat.
"It’s Spanish for, “I’m an absolute idiot.”"
What a clown.
She is NOT a Republican.
The bar is calling! Please heed the call.
That one single clap in the back killed me
She&#39;s NOT a Republican!!!
Oh no she didn’t 🙄🇵🇷✨
A.O.C single handedly the cringiest person in congress 😬
She’s fine
She’s appropriating Puerto Rican culture according to liberal standards?!  Cancel her!!!
AOC is not the Republican (R) of New York!
"I&#39;m glad she asked for a translation. This is America. We speak English here, little lady"
Who cares???
"I&#39;m certain she was worse at being a bartender, than she is in Congress. Everytime she speaks, I think of a train derailing."
Rep. doesn’t mean Republican it means Representative. 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
Let’s remember that there are people in this country that voted for her… let that sink in
"Jesus Christ, their facial expressions in the background they’re so damn fake. It’s sickening."
"I was instantly reminded of J.F.K.&#39;s sentiment of &quot;Ich bin Ein Berliner.&quot; While the intent was to profess a sense that he is one in common with the people of Berlin, it translates roughly to &quot;I&#39;m a jam-filled doughnut of German origin.&quot; He could have at least provided a translation so the real linguists could fix it.<br><br>We would all benefit if government officials would know the most common languages of U.S. territories, neighbors, allies, and adversaries, but there are many who speak and understand only English, and for some with much difficulty. Know your audience. <br><br>If you address the audience in one language, but want educate the audience about a common saying in another language, provide a translation."
The people of New York make great choices
"When the Spanish speakers are saying “What?!”, you know it’s bad."
Tax dollars well robbed
As a Democrat...what a goof.
She looks like she doesn&#39;t take any of this seriously.
"She never ceases to disappoint us with her lack of the knowledge regarding the Constitution, yet she is a member of congress"
She is not a Republican
Lunatic 😂😂
The lady behind her laughing 😂
Labeled her as republican......no no no we don&#39;t want her!!!
Such an embarrassment she is
The very thought that this female might have children sends chills up and down my spine.
"&quot;I&#39;m Boricua, just so you know.&quot;"
She is not a Rican she&#39;s a Ricant.
The difference between Trump and the rest<br>Eo-I&#39;m good for black/Hispanic....<br>Trump-for AMERICANS that&#39;s what I wanna hear!!!
She needs to be on a one-way plane ticket to Puerto Rico.
SHE&#39;S  A DEMORICAN!!!!😂😂😂
Just when we think she can’t get even more embarrassing…….she does!
You missed the best part of this clip: she was not able to provide a translation for the Spanish because she just learned that phrase before she went up to speak
The fact that the people of NY keeps putting AOC back in Congress makes me have no respect for New Yorkers. I hope every major company that has ever thought relocating to NY goes to any other state and may the next million illegals all go to NY.
Can&#39;t even memorize one proper sentence of Spanish
Lmao… she was practicing that shit😂
"She really though that this was necessary, and smart."
I’ve been to 26 countries and in every single one I tried to assimilate myself to their language and culture. It is very very rude to go to another country and expect your hosts to speak English and cater to you. I would definitely not speak English in a speech in a foreign countries legislature.
We don&#39;t claim her as PUERTO RICAN
This lady is so far from a supporter of her people and more for herself
I am Ecuadorian by birth grew up in N.Y.C I been here 51 years and I like her but she made Spanish and herself look bad.It&#39;s yo si soy Boricua para que tu lo sepas.She is Bronx born so basically she is not she is a New York Rican.
You know if an American went to the Spanish house of Congress and left on a note in English that would be a disrespectful person
So all she said was she’s puerto rican. Is this something on immigrations? Cuz Puerto Ricans are American citizens.
I’m sure all Puerto Ricans repel her 😂
"I still say we have found our Morticia for the next Addams Family movie<br><br>Edit: having given this further thought, I think Haley Stevens from Michigan should at least get an audition"
"Hey USA Today, AOC is not a Republican, the R after her name should be a D."
Send her away.
AOC is the Dylan Mulvaney of Congress
Why haven&#39;t they got rid of her yet
The Angel of Chaos (AOC) is spewing nonsense again
The great bartender ⛑🏴‍☠️🙄🤣😷😂🐎🐴😁🤪🤠😹
"Should be removed from congress, times are changing!"
Her coming from Westchester county does not groove with Puerto Ricans from the Bronx yet they keep voting for her. Smh
Well AOC can just go back to Puerto Rico
AOC this is America.  We speak English.
This woman can be president of the U.S. ¡Pa’ que tú lo sepa’!
W   T   F  was that
When does her term end?  If she is reelected the people of her district will prove their ignorance !
AOC POLISH THE HELL OUT OF A NOB!!!!
"Why so much hate?  I&#39;m very conservative, the true type. Not the highjack conservative of today so you&#39;ll know.<br><br>But this video made me proud of how this &quot;New Yor(k) Rican&quot; born in the Bronx spoke Spanish with that very, very beautiful Puerto Rican accent. Not like most Hispanics who are ashamed of their roots &amp; try to hide their accent. Very sad!"
“Gentle ladies” DO NOT speak in Spanish slang while speaking in Congress.
“Pa’ que tu lo sepa’”<br>That’s the literacy level she operates on.
She&#39;s proud to be a Puerto Rican American. I bet she will get backlash from the haters ⬇️
This is America. We speak English here. Not Mexican
"Other round of frozen Margarita, please."
What&#39;s the purpose in speaking English to conservatives? They don&#39;t want to hear the message anyway.....
Oh but that’s weird because there isn’t an official language in the USA
She’s ignorant and ruined my last name
Don’t destroy and use my BEAUTIFUL LANGUAGE SPANISH!
"Translated, she said &quot;I am an idiot that got this position for the money.&quot;"
I’m Guatemalan n I’m more Puerto Rican than her
We do not claim this person at all. She doesn&#39;t represent Puerto Ricans
"I don’t speak Spanish, WTF did you just say ?"
She acts like she&#39;s burdened for being asked to translate meanwhile I have no idea what she said
"no she aint!!!  We Puerto Ricans have revoke her PR Card, we have cut all ties !!!"
She&#39;s actually Mexican 🌮🌯
She speaks spanish bit that was atrocious
"In a refrain that is said by USA , the ella es una droga."
Trump 2024
Most liberal republican.
"if she was from AIPAC, no one would have asked her!!"
Ppl are seeing thru your BS Mrs Ed
"Disfraces esto Pueto Rican ?? Disgrace to anyone that speak Spanish , except for the Spaniards under Sanchez"
Bet she had to ask her mom to provide her Spanish sentences.<br><br>She’s Puerto Rican ONLY when it’s convenient for Her.
100% certifiable.  Go make us a drink…..
I am PuertoR and i am not proud of her. Not a bit.
She should have gone back to Puerto Rico when she turned 18 if she loved her country and country folk 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Only English should be spoken on the floor of our U S. Congress and only the American flag displayed there !!
She’s such a caricature.
I forgive you my baby
"Owning a property in PR, I can tell you now from many conversations I have had with many PR&#39;s citizens, they do not want statehood.  &quot;We like what the United States gives us, but we don&#39;t want to pay taxes.&quot;  They do not want the responsibilities of Statehood."
Is she allowed to speak wrong in court during work? &quot;Pa que tu lo sepa&quot;  is wrong. Don&#39;t they have elementary schools in her country?
It appears as if the sign language interpreter needed help. I think that was the woman asking the speaker to have AOC repeat it
Why does the closed caption translate in Spanish but we are in America WTF transparency my ass across the board
She really thought she ate
"You are an American citizen, in an official institution of your country, so speak english! <br>And this is my point of vue despite not being American or having english as my first language."
The fact that she represents anyone
She always mad My god I think she only in her 30 but she look old she look like 55
No one cares enough to even translate it.
Basic high school Spanish <b>gasp</b>
Sooooo tired of politicians. Their self-importance is out of this world. Look at them all sitting there. Annoying af.
How. <br>How? Does she get votes...
She&#39;s neither gentle nor a lady.
Spoken poorly i might add.
Spanish is Americas second language so they can look it up republiclans
Puerto Ricans don&#39;t claim you! Trump 2024. God bless America 🇺🇸🇵🇷
Yeah give a DEI position to Congress for a land that isn&#39;t even a state. And hasn&#39;t had one bill that benefits ever American evenly passed. What was America thinking 🤔
This is so hard to watch that I cant stop watching it... do i have a problem?
The use of “ Pa” instead of “ Para” is vulgar in Puerto Rico where so many speak correct Spanish and not ghetto’s Spanglish. <br>For a graduate of Boston University and member of Congress one would expect more class and better reflection of her education. Suspect AOC may not even be aware of her faux pas and that is precisely the problem.
"She changed her accent just like Kamala, only when is necessary!!!"
"You&#39;re Puerto Rican?  So you know, big deal, bro!"
I love how she tried to speak so proper in english bus uses slang in spanish.  Identity crisis.
paque tu lo sepam ........... im an A merican with mexican roots ........ i understand that mexico spanish is diffrent from porto rico but i dont think she speaks spanish for real but she do got&#39;s some nice LEGG&#39;S
she&#39;s just like Jlo. Puerto Rican when its convenient
"What did she say, translated into English?<br>Love this young woman nicknamed AOC!"
this demon gotta go
"She said &quot;Yo Si,  Soy Boricua&quot; 😂 Thats &quot;I yes, I am Puerto Rican. The proper translation is &quot;Yo Soy, or Soy Boricua&quot;. She has terrible spanish"
The only time I’m embarrassed is when I remember she’s from my island 🤦🏽‍♀️
She can’t give a translation because those are the only words she studied for the speech.
"Bring it out in Mandarin, or Russian, or Martian.....She acts as if Puerto Ricans invented Spanish.....what a ......"
Still can&#39;t find a voter in her district who has voted for her. Been asking for years and walked the streets and bars several times. No takers. 😮
Comments are weird.
The most popular member of the New York Congressional delegation..
Was a bartender. Got put in a congresswoman’s job for about a 150K/yr a few years ago. Now worth 29 million. Yo si; nothing sus there.
She seems to be so proud of her colonial origins for someone who feigns anticolonial ideology
Bartender you really done it this time<br>Speaking in Spanish to have a good time....
Why cant our government use english?
"Well, I see  she is popular for a walk in the park"
Aoc will always be my PuertoRican daughter my princess 🤬
😂✝️🙏🇦🇺🇺🇸🇮🇱❤️TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP TOMMY TOMMY TOMMY TOMMY PAULINE PAULINE HANSON PM 💯
She has a mouth full of teeth … 😳😳
And just so you know I am Puerto Rican boricua just to make sure that you know
that wasnt really spanish hahahhahahah so weird!!!
I’ve never heard her speak Spanish before this and I just realized she has literally no Puerto Rican accent when she speaks Spanish… interesting.
"When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) said, &quot;Yo sí soy boricua pa&#39; que tú lo sepas,&quot; she was expressing pride in her Puerto Rican heritage. The phrase translates to &quot;I am indeed Puerto Rican, just so you know.&quot; <br><br>### Context and Meaning:<br><br>1. **Cultural Identity**: By saying this, she emphasizes her identity as a Puerto Rican, asserting her connection to the island and its culture.<br><br>2. **Defiance and Pride**: The phrase can also reflect a sense of pride and defiance, especially in the face of any challenges or misconceptions about her identity.<br><br>3. **Engagement with Audience**: AOC often uses bilingual language to connect with her constituents and the broader Latino community, showcasing her roots and solidarity with Puerto Ricans.<br><br>Overall, the statement reinforces her identity and serves as a reminder of her cultural background and the significance of Puerto Rican heritage in her life and political work. 🤷‍♂️"
"😂 why do they need a translation? Man, I am nobody and speak 4 languages. Why are these “educated” politicians only speaking English? 🤡😂😂"
She needs to go back to waitressing. Her one liners might work in a bar!
She should provide a translation!
I apologize...&quot;I am AOC&quot; but I cannot spell AOC...
"I&#39;m also Puerto Rican, I&#39;m kinda happy that there is someone in Congress to represent us but we could definitely have someone better! At the same time I&#39;m still disappointed with the government as a whole. All Republicans and Democrats do is fight and argue to get votes. They never do what they say they are gonna do! (At least most of them). What about the open borders? Letting all those potential terrorists cross over. I live in Maryland, and already heard on the news about innocent American women being killed by gang members from Mexico, El Salvador, etc. I don&#39;t hate everyone from there, just the ones who commit crimes. They also need to watch the northern border to Canada too. Prices are still high. So many other issues that need to be fixed."
Spoken word is interpretation. Written word is translation.
Why can&#39;t Puerto Ricans talk proper Spanish? 😂😂😂 <br>&#39;Pa que tu lo sepa&#39; 😂😂😂
In the refrain ???
She’s so cute when she opens her mouth 😀
I am Puerto Rican. <br>She IS Puerto Rican. <br>She’s no MJT LOL. When she speaks- she says something. No scandals. Extremely intelligent. <br>And soooooooo freakin HOT. <br>Hate on Haters. We ❤️❤️❤️ our Haters😉😘.
As we ring out in the refrain that is said across the world?? Then says I am Puerto Rican so that you know? What?!!!!
Why don&#39;t you guys like AOC?? THAT&#39;S WILD!
Proud of her foreign languange..but unfortunately we don&#39;t understand.
Jesus Christ Almighty...
"&quot;Yo quiero Taco Bell!&quot; ...&quot;Thank you, that is all... I yield the remainder of my time...&quot;"
Cringe
I like AOC. I do not like this.
"P.Rican from midwest, we think she&#39;s evol. Worst P.R  politician in history.."
Y&#39;all are really mad over nothing. Really performative.
So many Ruski bots commenting on this video....
Aside from that sentence does she actually speak Spanish 🧐
Omg her spanish accent sounds really fake XD
"Translation or interpretation?<br>🤦‍♀️ Maybe if you studied another language, you’d improve your vocabulary."
Should be completely in English!!
First time I&#39;m hearing this phrase &quot;known around the world&quot;
&#39;LOOK ERRYBODY IM ETHNIC HURR DURR.&#39; Its so vapidly boring.<br><br>Your insidious identity politics is as childish as it is unimportant.
"I&#39;m from the DR, but stand with America. If the DR was better then I should fly back where I came from. I don&#39;t fly any other flag but 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸. End of story."
I&#39;m surprised she didn&#39;t say Yo quiero taco bell.
"&#39;Gentlelady&#39;??  Smdh It&#39;s Women and Men.  Or if you prefer formal, then it&#39;s ladies and gentlemen.  Don&#39;t tell me, she spells women as &#39;womyn&#39; too???"
I&#39;m Puerto Rican and this was Cringe! We don&#39;t claim her!  TRUMP 2024🎉
Imagine doing this in a Spanish-speaking country’s court.
Just because she said a few words in Spanish doesn’t justify anything. Actions matter more.
why youtube algorithm sent me here just to give me goosebumps 😢
AOC: &quot;I represent Puerto Rico even though I have never lived there myself&quot;
"Politicians try so hard to be like us. They&#39;re just like Drake, Not like us"
Free Borikén from U.S. occupation! 🇵🇷🐸
Send child voice silver spoon bye.
"Lady, I&#39;m sorry but this is the United States of America Congress"
Taylor Sharon Lewis Mary Martinez Dorothy
What the heck kinda Spanish is that?!! Is that how Puerto Ricans speak?! What is &#39;Sepa&#39;?!
You can&#39;t provide a translation when you don&#39;t know what you just said
"That&#39;s right, Cortez not everybody is Puerto Rican in New York or in this country"
Voting for Ocasio-Cortez is like voting for Maduro&#39;s wife here in Venezuela. 😒🤮
Wait do puerto ricans not like AOC because she hasn&#39;t brought puerto rico statehood yet or...?
"Wow,she&#39;s aging just like an old Spanish granny"
"AOC is awesome. HAVE SOME PRIDE, PRs. Cheer our people. <br>You think rePUBICans are helping us? Think again"
Our primary language is English thanks though…
This is America!!! Speak English! (As i play in south American servers online)
my favorite big booty latina!!!!!  the most cringe worthy woman on earth. love you Aoc 😂
But guys remember...black lies do matter.
She&#39;s so deep into politics now that even her constituents don&#39;t understand simple Spanish that leaves her mouth...
"When labeled communities thirst for self-empowering messages from personalities like James Baldwin, Malcom Shabazz, Marcus Garvey, WEB Dubois, F. L. Hamer, etc., they are left with Ms. Cortez.<br><br>Caribbean Hispanics need to eschew Ms. Cortez’s message of dependency cloaked as benevolence.  Meanwhile, STEM graduates from Asia are setting the standard for academic excellence. <br><br>We only have ourselves to blame, as we sing, dance, and shake ourselves into cultural obsolescence."
Puerto Rican also raised in NYCHA. To be a member of congress you must be an American regardless of heritage. Immigration Integration into Nationalism.
One of many languages spoken in he <br>US. Repressive Anglos fell challenged!
Would definitely give AOC the z sumpin’ just not my vote
This is as bad as Kennedy calling himself a Jelly Donut while in Germany.
&quot;Yo Si from affluent Westchester.&quot; 🙄
The first Amendment includes right to language choice which is why we don’t have a national language.
&quot;Gentlelady&quot;?? 😂😂😂 This worldd....
"Who does she think she is? Speaking terribly spoken Spanish? Sounds more like some dialect, rather than Spanish…"
I don&#39;t like her carrer politian
PLAYING BOTH ENDS AGAINST THE MIDDLE. A SINCERELY SNEAKY -SNAKEY  SO-N-SO.
"😂😅😂😅😅😅😅 she translated it to , Yo Karo syrup Taco Bell"
We need her translation skills here in Chicago because we&#39;re expecting up to 25.000 more during DNC. Don&#39;t blame Abbot. Blame Mayor Johnson and Governor prickster.
"Im from Germany, but shouldn&#39;t you speak ENGLISH in governmental bodys!?? Or at least translate right away."
How did she get voted in? Seriously Puerto Ricans or wherever she’s from sage yourself from this woman!
As a public servant she should be speaking ENGLISH when she is performing the duties of her office.  I say this as the grandma of a Puerto Rican granddaughter.
All lives matter what??
What she said in translation is make America great again vote for President Trump
She is so irritating. Her body language the way she talks her voice everything is irritating
"She just tell Spanish Speakers in Spanish, &quot;now is the time to invade America&quot;?"
Why this woman keep living of our taxes ?
"Prisoners &amp; terrorists were not released by Dr. Yunus government in Bangladesh🇧🇩, on August 5 after Sheikh Hasina&#39;s escape, the corrupt police released the prisoners &amp; terrorists by helping India🇦🇷"
"She didn’t say it Correctly, even tho it seems rehearsed"
"Her arrogance and racist tendencies were showing, that statement meant more to her than following decorum. Why they let her off 110th and Roosevelt I&#39;ll never know..."
Yo si is not ( I am) Yo soy is I am .. she&#39;s just using a Puerto Rican expression to act as she&#39;s more boricua than me ..born and raised in Puerto Rico... She&#39;s American just like my kids..
I don&#39;t like her and unless she&#39;s standing in Puerto Rico she needs to be speaking English🤦🏻‍♀️
As she should but I’m still voting for Kamala
We really need to make English our national language…
I am Puerto Rican and I don’t like her or will  support her in anyway !!
"So, she’s a representative in the USA, but claims to be Puerto Rican? Huh?"
She just shamed PR. She’s awful in every way shape or form
"As cringe as it is, she has a point... your country does NOT have an official language."
She knew nothing of PR political mess regarding statehood....got into it and needless to say came out with a black eye.
What Ashame you are living out of USA salary I know. That Puerto Rico became part of The USA but the way you talk is an ungrateful way of referring to the land you are stepping on
"The translation left out the most important part, Soy Boricua means &quot;I AM&quot; That&#39;s what &quot;soy&quot; means, but they truncated that part which was the essence of her statement.  What does, &quot;Puerto Rican, just so you know.&quot; mean?  She said, &quot;I am Puerto Rican...&quot;"
It’s an English country. Atleast as if today
People here are so weird she is the American Dream. Stop being weird. 🇲🇽
Tell her the Puerto Rico in unrecognized now and becUse of people like her the Tainos are gone
Tell her the Puerto Rico in unrecognized now and becUse of people like her the Tainos are gone
she doesnt sound puerto rican when she speaks spanish
Nothing personal but you should be representing the citizens of the United States. Glad you are proud of your heritage but there is time and place for that.
She’s saying she’s an Indian from the Boricua tribe. This is of course when a Puerto Rican was a glint in a Spaniards eye.
"What? You&#39;re from Rich Port, Oh Puerto Rico You mean, it doesn&#39;t sound as fancy &amp; cultural in English does is..."
"Soooo fake, we don&#39;t claim her....she would not last a day in Puerto Rico😅"
I hate to credit AOC but to be fair we should be teaching Spanish in elementary school. We should be more friendly with our neighbors. (That doesn’t mean we should leave the door open tho😂)
What she meant was what has been by the burden has been and has be as the burden
Just remember puerto ricans are Americans and I&#39;m proud of that. Because my parents are from Puerto Rico I am from New York so we are American citizens and them Proud
First of all as a bronx native AOC is from Yorktown Heights that&#39;s like repping Compton when you&#39;re from Beverly Hills secondly I have not met a Puerto Rican person in New York that likes AOC
You see the hatred and anger she speaks with as well as the girl smiling behind her. <br>They’re just hoping that soon we will all be speaking Spanish and English will no longer be our language. This is all HATE!! There is nothing kind or loving here.<br><br>USA AND ENGLISH!!!❤❤❤<br>TRUMP 2024🎉🎉🎉
Not American first huh? <br>😂<br>Great passage of time for America
Shes not Puerto Rican. <br>She is a Usas citizen. <br>You dont have the right to say this living in the USA. <br>Puerto Rico es España. Y siempre lo sera.
"Alright. Time to brush up on my Irish &amp; Scottish. “Yo! I see yer fookin’ panderin’, lassie, an’ it don’t impress me much, mauverneen.”"
Comments are a red flag. Maybe stop invalidating her identity and go touch some grass
She should be removed from Congress for that alone.
Puerto Ricans have Olga and Chayanne and Daddy Yankee and so many othes even Bad Bunny none of them would endorse her
",Boricua are the native people not of Spaniards if i am not mistaken"
"I know real Puerto Ricans, great people that I work with and have the honor to call friends. AOC is no Puerto Rican."
I thought i was in a different dimension before realizing the R didnt meant republican
Make English the absolute language in the US. What she just said was a finger to the uSA
I like all the white white people claiming to be Puerto Rican in the comments lmao.
Crazy I thought we were in America. Do you think she would be representing the people in her district that speak English but we know who she’s really after
Certainly if you speak in diverse tongues you should have an interpreter present to translate. ;)
well since we got all these claims that people could do whatever say whatever and ever any language in the American Senate and House of Representatives maybe some of these people should start speaking in German
Love her or hate her the House Rules of Procedure and the House Rules of Decorum require the Speaker to ask that.  While you may think her comments were cringe or not they have to ask that when foreign languages are spoken.
"What do you call the squad in quicksand ??  Answer :  cuatro sinko , of course ."
"She needs to go back to tending bar. She was probably a wonderful bartender, but i don’t think she is a good politician. Especially not for true Americans. Puerto Rico isn’t even a state and doesn’t want to be until they need our money or any type of aid.. 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"
Puerto Rican here! We don’t claim her. Please let the Italians take her!
"She brings more to the table than Boebert, MTG and Gosar combined"
"Im done...that phrase makes no sense translated. This is why learning another language is harder, because the actual native speakers hardly speak them proper anymore. <br>Im just saying, not sure where the &quot;si&quot; comes from...&quot;yo si soy...&quot; that seems like the si was an additive...without si, it then becomes what she was actually saying &quot;i am...&quot; as of now it looks like &quot;i yes am<br>.&quot;<br>But languages like to play games and will say thats slang"
"I live in Bentonville Arkansas, headquarters of Walmart, and we have people from literally every continent except Antarctica bc Walmart likes to move people around the world a lot for their jobs and nobody has ever said anything like that. I know a few people from there and none of them have ever said anything close to that. They act like Americans and are some of the chillers guys to hang with until you meet someone who thinks like this woman.😂we once had a guy who was Egyptian/nigerian/ British and would give us just as much shit as we gave him (joking around obviously) but singling out one group and saying they all think like you is ignorance"
Puerto Rico is a territory of the US… when on the floor speak English.
That Cortez person is a mini Kamala Harris!!😂😂
The Russian Trolls are at work here making empty comments. I am at least AOC helps bring some sanity to the sick state of American politics.
This is what happens when you let people from other countries in your government.
"I&#39;m hispanic and I would never ever speak spanish in this situation even though she worked hard to remember the pronunciation, I don&#39;t even use it at work with others, I only use it outside of work with friends and family."
This is America what doesn’t she understand
She said that perfectly fine and people hating like shut upppp
This woman is a disservice to the Latin community.
She is beautiful 😍 but she seem like bad attitude 😒 trump could like her but i get her feelings I am same way ..😊❤❤ but babe letting it know 😊
"She was born in new York, she&#39;s not Puerto ricaña, my parents were born in mexico that doesn&#39;t make me mexican because I never lived or ever been a civilian in mexico, I was born in america and I&#39;m indigenous american"
As a illegal immigrant from Mexico .. we can not stand her and do not support her. She is crooked
Why does my girl embarrass herself w shit like this 😂😂
I thought she was elected to represent Americans in the Bronx.
"You Know they are So many chances <br>And people take Them,"
Love your discussion videos way more than even the discussion based channels out there like Magic Historian and Pleasant Kenobi and especially Desolator Magic🙄. Keep it up because you have very reasonable takes that are refreshing and not rooted in engagement baiting
I didn’t hear a boricua accent there AOC. And I’m sure you rehearsed that line a billion times
"Does this woman not realize that Puerto Rico is part of the United States?  Puerto Rico is a territory of the United States. They are considered US citizens.  They can travel freely, and move anywhere they want in the United States. Once they have residency within one the 50 states, they are granted every single right as an American, such as the right to vote for President.  A person from Puerto Rico can enter the United States (50 states) anytime they want, and they can move here anytime they want.  There are about a half a million Puerto Ricans in the American military that fight for our country every day."
"I&#39;m proud of you AOC, YOU GO GIRL!!!!!"
Jqlajsalais she learn that sentence before go to bed lol
"Official language is English in UK and US, those who need translation can hire a translator.  Such translation should be provided in All Languages or none.  It&#39;s discriminating against non-Spanish immigrants.  It&#39;s offensive to non Spanish Americans who&#39;s second language is non Spanish (least popular language around the world since Spanish empire no longer exists 😂)"
She sucks....seals it by this statement to only help her
If you want to see how did ened her &quot;vision&quot; of &quot;socialism&quot; all you need to do is look through history and read about collapse of the soviet union and venezuela😢
how does this help America...crazies
You not Boricuas born and raised in the island you cannot say you have experience what’s a Boricua living at all you to spoil
God couldn&#39;t figure out anything else to do with this skin?
"First time I ever heard the word &quot;gentle-lady&quot; in my entire life. What kind of world we living in? For the record, AOC ain&#39;t worthy of that title anyway"
😂The women behind her 👵you did great Joe
"My wife is Salvadorian, I’m Aryan as heck yet I am more Latino than AOC"
"Pretty standard procedure, the scribe on the House floor has to record what was said."
Damnn that was so cringy and im boricua in pr. Scripted for tiktok
"She is aware that their land is but a Colony of the United States , right ? Mija you need to first check yourself at the door and maybe help your island have autonomy.  Also noticed voice getting all nervous toward the end.  Solo por voto ase su show esta vieja"
Wait what?! 😂😂Biden said his uncle was eaten by cannibals?? Im stoned and this video is taking me outtt
"I am so sorry for New Yorkers. I know they can handle themselves, but my heart still goes out to the citizens ❤😢"
Sorry! Is she for the US or Puerto Rico and the rest of the world 😮 should she be representing you in Congress?👀
Jesus I’m Hispanic and my Spanish isn’t that best bad damn way better than that. It’s “yo soy” 😂
"I despise this “human being.”<br>I wanted to use the “C” word, but I’m trying to be a better person"
Ask her to elaborate on that in Spanish. I’d love to just see how far she gets.
This is America AOC! We speak English here.
I like her confidence and i used to watch her videos
She just flaunts her ignorance
she sounds like a teachers pet showing off her one line of espanol
I don&#39;t speak Spanish; what was the translation?
Get out of the U.S.A. and take the rest of your &quot;squad&quot; with you 😡
WE LOVE YOU AOC! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!  YOU ROCK!
Don’t forget… her granny lives in a shack
Can you put links to the videos your channel depends on?
I identify as a based Puerto Rican in the comments section and I just died of cringe pa que lo sepas.
It’s hard to read the comments. You see the red people and they stick together thro thick n thin. I would never run for government. It’s a lonely road that non in the comments can relate lol.
"Well, by start packing go back to Puerto Rico."
She continues to segregate the population!
They want to rule a nation but cannot understand the most basic of dialogue.
Bronx dump her.<br><br>Two of the Squad are gone
Why her family move to América?
I love AOC but why does it say (R) New York!! she is not a Republican
Damn i thought she was American ???
Cringe
I doubt any PRs claim her
You can get your Puerto Ricon rear back to the island
"So, what&#39;s the big deal on being a Burricua ❔🤔"
Aoc walk the streets of ur community  I dare u
The fact that people on the left don’t see the virtue signaling is insane to me. You are truly lost if you cannot tell that these people are lying to you.
Arriba Alexandria
Can&#39;t wait till she can run for president.
"“Yes, I am a Puerto Rican, so that you know! “  she sounds like an entitled brat… um… no one cares 😂"
Im starting to think she cant speak Spanish. She has messed up before which is why i gather its been so long since she made another attempt.
I don’t think AOC is bad but damn that was corny. 😭😭💀
I believe Biden is Puerto Rican also. He said he was.
I love AOC! Keep up the great work Lovely! 💕
She doesn&#39;t speak even speak Spanish
I&#39;ve seen many Jr. High girls with more sense than her.
Your speaking to the boards Harris you see
What was the reason to make a useless statement other than letting everyone know how she is street material.
"I don’t like her, she is so arrogant , rude and no smart enough to work to the government"
She definitely doesn&#39;t represent me
She definitely doesn&#39;t represent me
She is so very beautiful ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Babe will heart break me if I was a date no offense but much respect to her rights
I’m half Puerto Rican and we want nothing to do with her
Cringe
Send her to Gaza for some charity work.
She should leave the dark side and come on over to the light.
"All the hate and venom directed at her is just sad. <br><br>But the incels need someone to yell at, I guess."
I want Puerto Rico to become an independent nation.
don&#39;t put down my Country like this
aoc single-handedly put an end to blonde jokes.
She shoulf have replied &quot;google it&quot;
Uhm ..Cringe button 🫣<br>👇🏻

Translation <br>&quot;Im a liar in two languages&quot;
"I don&#39;t speak Spanish, and I know she messes it up."

She should’ve said “ Si soy una imbecile”!
In what regard is refrain had from the statement she made?
Criiiiiiiiiiiiiiinge!😂
I&#39;m not following this context at all 🤔
Asking for a translation?   Micro or Macro aggression.
She was hoping for cheers but got that one clap in the back .. lol fkn lame
The real name is Sandy Cortez.
Talk about word salad bullshit
Puerto Rican American 🇺🇸
As a Puerto Rican that was so cringe to watch
Democrats pride and joy
AOC should not be allowed  to speak
😮 translation ..I need your votes?
She never refers to people as Americans.
What is the Translation tho? Curious
So what if they asked for a translation.
Haven’t cringed this hard in a while
We do not care
"She does not speaks spanish... I don&#39;t even know how many times she had to repeat that short sentence, still came out like a gringa 😆<br>The Boricua more Latina I&#39;ve ever seen, if PR was located in South America😂😭😭"
No you&#39;re not. Badly pronounced

Even Asians can say that simple line
"Wow! I&#39;m impressed! I didn&#39;t realize that she could speak Spanish! But, since she is Latina, I would be more impressed if she could speak the language of the ancient Romans + the Roman Catholic Church which is Latin. If 1 notices, there are at least half of USA state seals that have a Latin motto. Also our money has the Latin inscription, E Pluribus Unum."
What on earth was that supposed to mean?😳
Bro been on duolingo too much
That lady looks crazy...
Too funny ! She’s too smart for them 😂
That sounded Italian 😂
"With Trump as president, moral values of America will increase. We need him back to the White House to sweep away Biden’s and Kamala’s trash and MAGA! ❤🇺🇸♥️🎉🎊"

I ask my Spanish friend and she said the translation is. <br>I am an incredible Dumb ass.
"No sabe ni hablar español y tira del idioma para rascar votos.. lo peor es que este tipo de tretas políticas funcionan, la gente es demasiado inocente."
Si ajá claro...si es así porque no quieres que puerto rico sea parte de EEUU?... porque votarían a la derecha liberal clasica
"Si, si, manos. Claramente todo de la gente  boricua la odian. Si los commentos se reflejan de verdad. Talvez nadie puede explicarme poque, como lo que pasó? Lo que ella hice mal?"
Puerto Ricans don&#39;t claim her . She should have said : 😅Yo si soy estupida pa que tu lo sepas
esa tipa aprenda hablar primero pa que tu lo sepa ??  para que tu lo sepas esto es castellano  oh espanol  se me hace esta gentevsin educacion es politica????
"Heres how you would actuall say that<br>Soy puertorriqueño, para que lo sepas"
esta Boracha  no representa  a los latinos primero que se educa  me irrita su espanol! y su actitud   solo es una oportunista  ya viste mejor
"Yo si soy boricá pa q tú lo sepas, dónde está el problema?"
"I think she means &quot;yo si soy pendeja, va que tu lo sepas&quot;"

"She said , I suck at my job and now I&#39;m going to have to go back to bartending."
"I love her so much! Go, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez!"
She only speaks very basic Spanish…She is not as fluent as most people think. She can’t hold an entire speech in Spanish. I’ve seen her try and it’s kind of embarrassing
No wonder she&#39;s annoying.  😂

An elected official proud to claim she is Puerto Rican wow. Why is she representing the American people?
😂
Hell nah! No quiero a una socialista representandome. I don&#39;t want a socialist representing me.
Hay why don’t you move to Puerto Rico and be the president of Puerto Rico and make Puerto Rico independent and you can run it the way you want it that would be a great thing for you<br>And for us in the USA😊

and you wonder why the dad wont let you see your kids
&quot;You&#39;ve dealt with me a million times&quot; - tells me the cops are sick of her.  She needs jail time and a mental health evaluation
Dad should get full custody. She doesn&#39;t have any coping skills.
I cannot express how thankful I am for bodycams and these videos 😂❤
She definitely ain&#39;t getting her son now
She doesn’t deserve custody of her children they aren’t safe with her. She’s unhinged.
It&#39;s depressing to think how many kids have parents like this
This behavior will be used against her in a child custody case.
&quot;Because you act like that!&quot; Welcome to the consequences of your own actions.
I am not married to this gal and I still want a divorce from her.
This is NOT how to gain custody of your child back.  This is exactly how you LOSE it.
"&quot;quit trying to turn this on me!&quot; <br>Ma&#39;am, you made this entire situation about YOU."
"Whoever decided this woman shouldn&#39;t have custody of a child was on point. On a separate note, what kind of handcuffing job was that?"
"&quot;You are under arrest&quot;<br>&quot;No I&#39;m not!!!&quot;<br><br>She said the magic words, the cops HAVE to let her go now."
"It’s insane how people refuse to take any accountability. Don’t ever give her son back to her, she’s unfit to be a mom."
&quot;You&#39;re under arrest!&quot; ......&quot;No I&#39;m not&quot;<br>&quot;You&#39;re going to jail!&quot; ......&quot;No I&#39;m not&quot;<br>&quot;I have a video of you trying to run me over!&quot; .......&quot;No you don&#39;t&quot; 😅😅😅
She actually said the Officers were psychos. Zero self awareness or accountability. Ugh🙄🙄🙄
I hope the father has custody of the son…. I love how people think they are above the law…STUPIDITY IS RUNNING RAMPANT IN THIS COUNTRY!!!!!
Keep this woman away from those children at all costs
I’m amazed she’s lived this long… she has the critical thinking and self preservation skills of an 8pc McNugget.
&quot;This is what happens to me every f*cking time!&quot; I wonder why...
Both these women are nuts.
"I want to take this opportunity to thank my own mother for never ramming cop cars, never fighting cops and rolling around and screaming on the ground, never tried to run over a cop and never did anything worth getting tazed for."
"Seriously, how do these people make real life decisions and function on a daily basis??"
Oh why are people like this please STOP ACTING LIKE A BRAT. I think her son is safer where he is at
I’m always in awe when people say “let me go” after having the cuffs on.
I will never understand why people think they don&#39;t have to comply when the police give instructions.
The art of making things so much more complicated than they have to be.
unbelievable she held onto her phone the whole time until she was tazed and then she claims she did nothing wrong
"So she genuinely thinks that she was doing nothing wrong by blocking her child&#39;s father&#39;s car into a parking spot, not allowing him to leave? She&#39;s confused as to why the police were there, acting as though &quot;they started it&quot; like she was just walking down the street peacefully and the cop came charging at her? <br><br>Top tier gaslighter - feel horrible for her child&#39;s father."
"Please NEVER allow her unsupervised visitation with her innocent son. She&#39;s the PROBLEM, not the husband, not the police but KAYLA! SERIOUS MENTAL, BEHAVIORAL AND ANGER MANAGEMENT ISSUES, THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED ASAP."
That sister has totally done this before and will do it again. Lying and acting hysterical is second nature to both of them.
"&quot;I&#39;m so scared of this man that I followed him in my car, blocked him in, stayed in close proximity, and prevented him from contacting police.&quot;"
The female officer summed up all the arrests on this channel-<br>&quot;Its because you act like that&quot;
You know the father is kicking himself for ever sleeping with her
"She&#39;s ramming police cars, glass is breaking, she&#39;s screaming, wrestling away and all the while.....that phone is protected at all costs."
If she ever wanted custody of her child she lost it right here. Completely out of control.
"“You’re under arrest”<br>“No, I’m not”<br>Oh, okay. Be on your way then."
"Getting tased twice, wrestled to the ground and put in cuffs. Somehow there is still a part in her brain that tells her that she isnt arrested."
Too crazy to raise a child.
“You’re an abuser!”<br>For…..doing his job? Lady you were given a generous amount of warnings 😂
Show me how you lose custody of your kid without telling me how you lose custody of your kid.
Girl whatever meds you’re on ain’t working
"A Father trying to protect his child from the abuse of his mother is Admiral... She has issues, she doesn&#39;t need this child around this chaos of hers."
Hope the dad is more stable &amp; gets custody of those kids fr 🤦🏽‍♀️😔
"Imagine making a lifelong mistake of marrying this woman and having a kid with her -  to be stuck having to deal with, talk to, associate with, etc... for years and years and years and years. Sorry to that dude."
"The fact that this all centers around her child makes me hope very, very strongly that she&#39;s not granted physical custody.  She is deeply unhinged."
She appears unable to provide a safe environment for a child.
I can&#39;t believe her husband didn&#39;t want to stay married to her
Our law enforcement don&#39;t get paid enough to deal with these people!
"Not listening to anything, calling family for back up, ramming two police cars and almost running over an officer. And she calls them psychos....... 🤔🙄"
"Lady officer is a boss! Even takes the time to look left for oncoming traffic before turning onto the road. Gets in place right on time! What a cool, calm, collected officer!"
She should absolutely never have any rights to see her kid. She’s obviously unstable.
"She needs to be admitted either to a mental hospital or jail, she’s going to seriously hurt someone. He needs to get custody of his son she’s too unstable."
“You are an abuser!!” - AFTER ramming TWO police cars and almost KILLING the female officer 🙄
As a Florida native I am glad that Ohio is starting to overtake my home state in the realm of insanity. lol
No need to say ALLEGEDLY. We&#39;re all watching the same thing as you.
Give the dad full sole custody and a restraining order on the mom to stay far away from them and put her in a psych ward
"Wow...two insane sisters. Great job, parents!!!"
Speaks volumes about why he wanted to file a police report.
"I saw the full arrest on another channel. She and her ex-husband are embroiled in a child custody case. The judge awarded her ex-husband full temporary legal and possessory custody for the time being based on her unstable and erratic behavior. He went to court to file paperwork for permanent sole custody and she blocked him with her car to try to keep him from doing so. He called the police. Over the years I’ve watched hundreds of cases, and to date her level of entitlement puts her in the top three of the most entitled people I have ever watched. Notice that she doesn’t think she must obey any laws or legal commands. I sincerely hope her ex-husband uses this video in court."
Trying to flee the scene and hitting two cruisers is not “doing nothing.”
I had an aunt who was like this. She never got better. Just lost everything and somehow it was still everyone else’s fault.
I hope this woman gets zero custody.
Bizarre how certain types of people have come to believe the law is only for other people. The entitlement is astonishing.
"He definitely does NOT need to give you your son, acting like that. I&#39;d be ashamed to have her as a mom."
"This woman is beyond delusional, and dad needs full custody.  This is not how you handle things."
"If she thinks that she&#39;s gonna get her son, that&#39;s ultimately NOT gonna be happening now"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=993"">16:33</a> Respect for women officer for maintaining humanity and dealing with the chaos at the same time."
Hopefully she isn&#39;t getting custody anytime soon.
&quot;You are under arrest!&quot;<br>&quot;No I&#39;m not!&quot;<br>&quot;You are going to jail!&quot;<br>&quot;No I&#39;m not!&quot;<br>I wonder how many times in the history of the world that has actually worked 🤣
“He wont let me see my son” Gee I wonder why
31? Looks like she&#39;s 49 with twelve kids.
She doesn&#39;t behave like an adult screams and shouts she shouldn&#39;t be aloud to drive she is a danger to other people on the road. She needs to grow up and stop behaving like a toddler
Amazing how she thinks she did absolutely nothing wrong. She isn’t fit to be a mom right now. Thank goodness for dad stepping up. He’s so calm. Moms unhinged
This woman has a great combo: detached from reality and an anxiety disorder.
WTF is wrong with people?!?!😮
<b>Cop shows up and IMMEDIATELY says:</b><br><b>&quot;Roll the window down or I&#39;m going to pull you out.&quot;</b><br><b>He was ready to shut this matter down ASAP. LoL!</b>
We live in a place and time where citizens actually believe they are in charge of every situation when dealing with law enforcement. Amazing.
"Geez, even the lady officer tried so hard to keep the situation calm... repeatedly trying to calm the woman down. Unbelievable."
"She disobeys, then rams her car into the police cruisers but then immediately screams in terror as if she really did not think there would be consequences?"
I like how she manages to never let go of her phone throughout her arrest.
The fact that this woman spends any time around a child is a horrifying notion. She shouldn’t be in charge of a GOLDFISH.
Has saying &quot;no I&#39;m not&quot; when a cop says &quot;you&#39;re going to jail&quot; ever really worked?
Kayla&#39;s therapist is facing unimaginable difficulties. Godspeed you unfortunate soul.
Censoring the tasering? Downvote.
"Where has this delusional entitlement came from? She almost strikes one officer, then causes criminal damage to another officers vehicle hit&#39;s a second vehicle. And for some reason while being a danger to public safety screams at officers who have ample reason to arrest her, to stay away from her? yeah... that&#39;s not how it works for criminals. Her sister screaming &quot;I need to calm her down&quot; is ridiculous She is 31 and should know how to act appropriately in public. The officers did nothing she turned a minor incident into something far worse."
That’s really gonna help your case in the dispute over custody of your child too.
Have to give the officer credit for being one of the more efficient at window breaking
"It always baffles me when the cops tell people they’re under arrest, and they say, no I’m not."
"She does everything possible so that the police will be forced to put hands-on her, but it&#39;s all their fault<br> They&#39;re  abusers. What a psycho"
I don&#39;t think the lil sis understands how lucky she truly was
Gives new meaning to the word &quot;hysteria.&quot;
Respect to all officers who deal with these people.
She mentioned seeing her therapist. How’s that working out for you? 😳
OVI=&quot;Operating a Vehicle While Impaired&quot; for our non US viewers
Is this the first time she’s ever experienced the outside world? Jeez
Her attempt to manipulate the police is disgusting. &quot;I don&#39;t feel safe&quot;. She&#39;s the unsafe one.
"&quot;you guys set me up&quot; all you had to do was roll your window down, everything after that is on you. Absolutely no accountability whatsoever."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=425"">7:05</a> This officer is brilliant. She knew exactly what needed to be done and without a moment to spare; that could have been a pedestrian or another moving vehicle. Wow."
Her sister screaming Kayla stop! made me sad😢. She knows her sister is not making the best decisions.
"If it were another country, she may have been warned once or twice at most."
"Broken window, dragged onto the pavement, tasered but she still keeps ahold of that phone."
"She shouldn’t have custody of herself, let alone a child."
"&quot;You are under arrest!&quot; &quot;No, I&#39;m not&quot; What planet do these people come from???"
"Kayla needs a psychiatric eval, ASAP. And an accountability transplant."
Karen:My hand is gonna break again <br>Officer: life&#39;s choices 😂
That female cops was trying to be so nice to this whacko.
"In the history of law enforcement &quot;let me go, i am not doing anything&quot; has never worked."
“I already talked to my therapist today…” <br>Forget the therapist &amp; just go with Thorazine &amp; a padded room until her son is a grown adult.
"Reminds me of the type of craziness I put up with. Trying to allow my son&#39;s mom in their lives. I finally got enough of the lies, drugs, cheating, and other drama. Of her being an irresponsible, neglectful parent and ran her off. Got full custody and raised them alone."
Sister should have gone to jail.  What a piece of work!
"Officer, you were making my sister face the consequences of her actions. You aren&#39;t supposed to do that to people like us.<br><br>Guarantee you that&#39;s what little sister meant."
"Well, I hope the courts give the dad full care and custody of the child… if she is that unhinged then she doesn’t need to be around any child."
Remembered those kids at Wal-Mart crying their lugs out. Well this is them 15yrs later. 😂
They really need to reopen mental hospitals.
"People should have to undergo a psychological evaluation in order to get a drivers license and in order to keep it they should have to do a repeat evaluation every 5 years, and this woman is precisely why."
I can&#39;t stand these kinds of people.
SO OVER the fake fear.
This girl should not be around any children and just because you take medicine doesn&#39;t make you above the law
These people are downright scary.
All that screaming and hysterics and refusing to comply with an officer. I&#39;m not surprised the father won&#39;t let her see her son.
The ex husband is now a firm believer in never sleep with anyone crazier than you.
👩‍💻🇺🇲The sister showing up escalated the situation. Stay home next time.
“You’re under arrest.” <br>“NO I’M NOT!” 🤣🤣😂😂
This psycho CANNOT be responsible for a child! She&#39;s right over the edge!
I don&#39;t think her medication was working.
Can&#39;t imagine why the dad would keep the child away from her. 🙄
As a psychologist I would petition her six months for mental health care.
"31, and acting like a child!! Causing a lot of issues and wasting taxpayer money! Whiny self absorbed ridiculous behavior! Poor sister got pulled into  her craziness!!"
"&quot;Quit trying to turn this around on me&quot;<br><br>Lady, you are the problem of all of this. What a pyschopath, I hope she never sees her son."
&quot;Those cops are psychos!&quot;<br><br>Apparently this is Kayla&#39;s world. We&#39;re all just living in it.
"I COULD NOT BE A POLICEMAN, NEVER ."
"I have to wonder why on earth he would file a complaint against that lovely, gentle passive woman."
Wow she really is totally out of her mind.. look at all the chaos she caused
Another woman who has never ever faced consequences for her behavior and has been reacting this way since childhood. Clearly these tantrums are nothing new for her. This is what happens when behaviors of childhood continue into adulthood.
I hate it when a person thinks they&#39;re so entitled they don&#39;t have to do what a police officer asks them to do.
Omg. She continues to act like the &quot;victim&quot; and she is the dangerous one. I hope that her kids are kept away from her. She definitely doesn&#39;t seem fit to raise any children.
"That childish temper tantrum screaming at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=293"">4:53</a> ... This woman is insane."
Smart work from the female office.
"Once you give Morgan &amp; Morgan your case, don’t expect to hear from anyone anytime soon"
Entitled isn&#39;t the first word I&#39;d use to describe her. More like delusional.
Yikes! We’re surrounded by truly scary people! 😮
Such an embarrassing time to be an  American. So many adults acting like  children.
Histerically resisting arrest seems to be a well established tradition in the US...
"Her sister is a mess as well, what about the dad? That kid may not have any hope."
"I love it when they say you’re under arrest and then the person says oh no, I’m not"
Kids should never be able to be around her
"Men, stop picking up the easy ones in the bar."
"The sister throws a fit when cop tells her she&#39;s going to jail for interfering. She really goes nuts over this news so he asks her if she&#39;s ever going to do this again? She babbles No. He lets her out. So now, she thinks all she has to do is act like a 5 y o and they&#39;ll let her off."
"So many narcissistic traits on display here. Deflecting, minimalising, gaslighted, blaming everyone else but herself."
&quot;You are under arrest&quot;.  No I&#39;m not.   &quot;You are going to jail.&quot;  No I&#39;m not.    I just love the delusion.
You&#39;re under arrest. No I&#39;m not. Sounds like me arguing with my little brother
This woman can&#39;t ever take responsibility for her actions. She did this all on her own.
"This menace tried to run over Officer Olivia, and that’s completely uncalled for. What a monster."
Dad needs to go file a TPO
Her behavior is shocking! She mentioned she&#39;d been arrested before so it seems like she knows the score.
Her &quot;therapist&quot; should have his license revoked.
EMTS must be sick and tired of perps trying to blame the cops.
I despise when women play the victim after they&#39;re clearly the ones that created the situation in the first place
One of over a million reasons why I chose to stay single...
This lady is wilding out! 😂
that escalated quickly
Our thoughts and prayers go out to anyone who has been in contact with this woman &quot;Ever&quot;
These officers need an instant raise! But three statements to roll down your window is the limit.
I couldn&#39;t imagine having to deal with people like this on a daily basses.
Allegedly rammed two cops cars? She for sure ran into two cop cars.
"She&#39;s ramming police cars, glass is breaking, she&#39;s screaming, wrestling away and all the while.....that phone is protected at all costs.  😂😂😂"
It is truly amazing to me how many people these days cannot do ANYTHING without their cell phone clutched in their mitts.
💯 someone who doesn’t need a child
"Gee, I wonder what her medication is for?"
&quot;Quit trying to turn this around on me&quot; is wild😂😂
How many cops does it need to deal with one hysterical woman?
She sure hung on to that phone. lol
The decline of society.
&quot;The jail won&#39;t let you have your phone&quot;<br>&quot;That&#39;s not really MY phone&quot;<br>.....uhm...do you really think that will change anything? There is something very wrong with the reasoning portion of this girl&#39;s brain
I can&#39;t believe how amazing these cops are.
"Sister should have gotten atleast 30 days for interference,  dangerous for both parties when the cop can&#39;t keep his attention on one person"
She is playing the poor little victim.
She&#39;s not seeing her son anytime soon
i truly hope for the dad&#39;s sake the court gives him full custody and a restraining order
It’s just not that hard. Follow the instructions from police and they treat you fairly. That’s it.
"OMG this entitled woman is just ridiculous!!! All she had to do is get out of her car, simple action. She is full of drama!!!"
I am so sick of people acting like this because the people that pay their taxes are the ones gonna be paying for the patrol car repair.
Something deeply wrong with her.
"The guy is like, does everybody believe me now that she is crazy?!!"
Threatning to snap while handcuffed in back or cruiser has never workd
She is definitely cra-cra!
"As soon as a another car is needed that should be a $500 fine.  Resisting orders should be $1000.  Car damages, ambulance call etc.  she should be billed and put against her credit with no possibility of bankruptcy."
Feel sorry for the child.  Why can’t parents work things out and think of their children.
&quot;This is what always happens to me.&quot; It would seem that she is having a difficult time comprehending cause and effect.
"There Are Probably a Lot of Us watching her make an Absolute Fool of herself, Who are Laughing Out Loud at her stupidly!!😅😅😅"
Was the son she hit witnessing this?  Total lunatic!
"Remember when people used to cooperate with the police? &quot;Yes, officer. Ok, officer.&quot;"
She’s a control freak. Her way or else.
"Say it ONCE, then TAKE ACTION. Stop treating drivers like babies."
Gee I can’t imagine why they aren’t letting her see her son. He is clearly better off for it she is absolutely nutters
She obviously is sick and should neither be allowed to have custody nor a drivers licence until she is better!
&quot;Quit trying to turn this around on me&quot; says the totally unhinged woman! 🙄
Be picky of whom you have children with.
Kayla&#39;s tutorial on &quot;how to ruin your life in 10 seconds and give your ex everything he needs for full custody&quot;
These type of people  ALWAYS have their phones in their hands. They start the drama and play the victim the entire time.
The result of 50 &quot; last warnings &quot;
"I’m so glad the father is going to the police regularly about her behavior, because this woman is dangerous. People do terrible things when relationships end, and if she’s willing to block that man from leaving his car and ramming his vehicle IN FRONT OF POLICE, she’s likely capable of worse. I hope that father stays safe."
Entitled much?
I truly hope she never gets custody of those kids.
Great way to get your son back.
There&#39;s apparently something in blue and pink hair dye that kills braincells
"Seeing how the sister acts just like her, it’s definitely how they were raised unfortunately"
It&#39;s the &quot;I&#39;m not doing anything&quot;that killed me😆
"Every time I watch first responders in these situations, I FEEL THAT THEY MUST REALLY LIKE SERVING AND PROTECTING US!❤❤❤ THANK YOU ALL🎉🎉🎉❤😊"
"Dude you didn’t even show the first taser, showing your ad instead? What gives?"
Dont think you have to use allegedly. She literally does it on video 😂
"Kayla&#39;s severe, screaming over reaction makes her sound emotionally disturbed"
lol well her ex will get full custody now 🤣😂
“Im not doing anything!!!” -Proceeds to do EVERYTHING.
"My goodness, Kayla was EXTREMELY dislikeable"
&quot;Dont let that man near me&quot; as shes blocking him in and not a single tear was shedding prior.
Entitled Karen  All she had to do was talk to the cop.  She made it ten times worse for herself
"&quot;Wow, you guys did it again&quot;<br><br>I need her as my lawyer"
Some people have never been punched in the face and it shows.
"Gets dealt with and never dropped that phone , impressive ."
"They closed the mental hospitals down and this is what we have walking among us, on the roads, etc."
She’s a problem
The clown 🤡  hair gives it away from the jump. 🤣
It blows my mind that there are so many people in this world that act like this.
She’s done nothing but escalate a situation. She just made her mess messier. Nasty!
"Between Ohio &amp; Wisconsin, something bad is in the Midwestern waters."
“Keep him away from me.” But she has him blocked in. 😂
So embarrassingly frustrating when people like her immediately start crying and claim that the cops are trying to hurt her and claim they already did “the other day” lol
Whatever happened to respect??
Allegedly?  She hit two cruisers…
We have to pray that the son doesn’t have any mental illness.
Waiting this long to take physical action is ridiculous.
"This is the second video ive seen on utube today like this.  Is the world loosing its mind?  Its scary how to avoid these people, and sad for police who have to deal with this irrational  behavior."
But never puts the phone down. Impressive
She asks for it. Poor guy shares a kid with her 😢
She’s lucky she didn’t get shot acting like around cops. A car is a deadly weapon.
Did she really say &quot;I&#39;m not doing anything!&quot; ?????😂
Cop at the end &quot;You&#39;ve dealt with me a million times.&quot; Girlypop is a frequent customer. Wonder what else she&#39;s been up to? 😂
I feel sorry for the father of her child. 18 years of dealing with this psych case.
"What is an emotional unstable person doing driving a motor vehicle, that is the first question."
She needs SERIOUS MENTAL CARE
Cops gave that woman way too many chances and it escalated.
all she had to do was comply and get out of her car. Why all the unnecessary and ridiculous drama ?
"She is such a polite, considerate, well-mannered lady..<br>Do not understand why the police tackled her in the past.   Stupidity and entitlement abounding. The child does not need crazy in his life"
It’s interesting to see officers not give endless chances before escalating unlike other videos I’ve seen
Wish I could see her day in Court
Why tf are your videos edited? There’s no need for the interruptions! A video says a million words!
When I say i am not when told I am under arrest I say no I am not lol.
Why are you blocking us watching the taser. Shame on you!
She just lost custody of her son.
"Man, that last cop that talked to her was the best. &quot;The decision has been made.&quot; Calm and collected and straight to the point."
So now we know the truth. Dad is protecting his son and mom just wants the child support.
"Oh no, a woman is crying. She must be the victim."
"This isn’t going to look very well for custody <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=358"">5:58</a>"
Why do these people have children? Children have to be traumatized. Smh
Omg! How many people in this country need mental health help!! She&#39;s doing everything that&#39;s going to get her a bunch of charges! Those cops are sick of her!
"Officers, I&#39;m so terribly sorry you have to handle situations like this 😮"
Love when people tell the cops they&#39;re not arresting them 😂
This girl has been this way her whole life!! It’s starts with the parents!!!  She needs to be checked!!!!!  DUMBA-S
"The cops were amazing. But in the interest of perserving the dignity of another human being, Kaye was acting on the love of her son. She&#39;s messed up and is too delusional  to realize that its her choice of bad behaviors that led to this. Clearly, the son belongs with the father, but this woman probably lost custody of her child forever because of this and other bad behaviors.  This is a tremendous loss, and I feel sorry for the child most of all. Let&#39;s try to remember Kayla is a person and throw her a scrap of dignity."
Quit doing 5 cutaways just show the damn clip
How does she function in the world? I suppose this shows that she doesn&#39;t 🤷‍♂
Entitlement is out of control these days.
"always playing the victim, while thinking they&#39;re the ones in control when the reality is the opposite on both."
"Wow crime is rampant in that hotspot of, where? Alliance Ohio?"
Why do people think that their phones are magic wand?
Clearly never told no or dont. Never held accountable. Never given consequences. Never given boundaries. Just an out &amp; out brat. This woman is our future?! We are all screwed!!!
&quot;Do not let them near me&quot; she says as she&#39;s blocking him from leaving. FFS.
I can&#39;t imagine why the father doesn&#39;t want their child around her.
“You’re going to jail” <br>“NO I’M NOT!”<br><br>Sorry sweetie it doesn’t work that way  😂😂
“I called the Sheriff so therefore the Police have no authority”.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=720"">12:00</a> I like how she still believes she’s not going to jail after all that 💀"
"The victim who did/does nothing wrong is extremely strong with this one!! <br><br>I’ve never seen the amount and level of gaslighting in a video before that this clown does!! Everything single thing that happened/happens, she immediately deflects and turns it around on the other person! 🙄"
"If you ever think you had it bad because your parents were too strict on you or disagreed with you on some things, just remember that some people have to grow up with parents like this..."
"I&#39;ve been in custody/detained/arrested 7 or 8 times in my life. Never at any moment, even when drunk, could I even imagine fighting back at all. Let alone screaming like a banshee and telling the cops how it&#39;s going to go."
Her child needs to be kept far FAR away from her.
Did she think ramming a police car was a solid idea?
She is a stalker and an abuser.  She should not have a drivers license and probably should lose her freedom until her obsession wears out over the man she was stalking.
Police was not wrong...she was wrong
"The woman may be in the wrong..... but those officers condescending, and bickering back and forth with her, like oh yes you did, oh no you didn&#39;t.... where is the professionalism"
Shame on officers........they were to gentle to her..........
How do people like this even get a driver’s license???
At what point did people get this mentally weak. It&#39;s an epidemic all the sudden
She should not be allowed her children back for any reason
"Rams two police cars, nearly runs over an officer, refuses to leave her car, cusses at the officers, fights them, has to be Tased twice... <br>OFFICER: &quot;You are under arrest, you are going to jail.&quot;<br>KAYLA: (Screaming) &quot;No I am not!!! For what?&quot;"
"Narcissistic personalities are the worst of the worst.<br><br>&quot;No, I&#39;m not being arrested&quot;..<br>&quot;No, I&#39;m Not going to jail&quot;.. <br><br>Grow up !!<br>Smdh.. 😞"
Praying this woman never sees her kids again 🙏
I just don’t understand how someone that wants to see her kid so bad thinks any of what she did or said was going to help her achieve that.
"My, my, my, how she does love the drama.  She basks in, and foments, the horrible drama she&#39;s putting her family through.  This could have easily escalated into people getting seriously hurt."
I will take this opportunity to point out that the video does NOT show her getting tased as those parts have been edited out.
Finally a cop that doesn’t waste time and gets the job done. I see so many of these Karen videos where the cops are there for an hour trying to talk sense into these lunatics
Never believe when she crys and screams at the same time
Yeah she’s definitely not getting her kids back now.
"Well, it’s clearest day that she doesn’t need custody of her son"
They were a lot more patient than I would have been.
"You can&#39;t be a woman cop without several arm tattoos and preferably full sleeves, it&#39;s a requirement to look gangster and less feminine."
Wow. History of this behavior and she is surprised to get arrested.
How does she function on a daily basis?
She has no business being around children. She is a danger to them and to herself.
What an insane woman!  She said she went through this with police last week!  Insanity is doing the same thing over and over  again and expecting different results!
This woman is extremely dramatic.
Pink hair says it all!
"This is how they usually act when they don’t get their way. It’s not a Karen thing, this is their default.  entitled and playing victim"
"I wonder how many people she has made false claims against. Her past should be reviewed for the damages she has caused,"
You’re under arrest. Karen: No I’m not!
...she found out
Somebody raised these two daughters well.
"That other women received an absurd amount of leniency. Of course, that&#39;s just my expert unprofessional opinion.😂"
Ohio has surpassed Florida. This truly is one of the moment.
Mental
Give her 60 days in jail😡😡
"Oh for gosh sake, let her go ... she told you she&#39;s not under arrest. Snap to, lady and gents! <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hcMfY5_zAbbxvwKLooCoCA""></a>"
Her poor kid…
"Cop: &#39;You&#39;re going to jail.&#39; She: &#39;No, I won&#39;t!&#39; - Someone tell her the truth.&quot; 🤦‍♀<br>&quot;Maybe she needs a course in &#39;police manners&#39;.&quot; 📚"
"Does she say &quot;I&#39;ve got that no contact order with the Mayor&quot; at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=1010"">16:50</a>????"
"Perhaps her behavior is out of control, because she screams “give me my meds” when things aren’t going her way. Maybe she should act like an adult and work through the situation and learn some self control."
She dared to crash into a police car? Horrible! She seemed completely out of control. Kudos to the officers for handling the situation so professionally.
"Ahhhh, there it is; the famous, &quot;No I&#39;m not!&quot; when they&#39;re being told that they are arrested. That fail proof get out of jail card always works!"
I&#39;ve lived in several states and one other country;  I SWEAR Ohio is the strangest State Ive ever lived in.
&quot;Allegedly&quot;?      Thumbs down for that.
Allegedly rammed into cruiser??
31 going on 3 and a half.
Why can’t ppl like Kayla act normal?  Why can’t you follow commands? She’s acting like a brat without respect to authority. You try to control situations.
"the sister screaming when she rams the car, as if they were doing something to her. Psycho was caught in the act of stalking the guy, ramming a cop car and she still thinks it&#39;s everyone else. and is her medication something to replace a narcotic?"
"She didn’t even care her child is there, she is dangerous and irresponsible, very unstable."
Only in ohio
hilarious
The father of her child definitely needs to be careful that woman is dangerous
"“This just happened”<br><br>If there is a last time, maybe you need to consider that your behavior is problematic and you need to change it. Instead, she’s gonna tell everyone it’s the cops that’s the problem."
Female cop is dope
This is the same Kayla that rear ends a car while delivering food and was screaming at the cops. She also called 911 then hung up in another video.
"when in trouble, get on your phone and scream"
"I actually feel sorry for this lady, she desparately needs professional help !"
Final Boss Karen.
Crazyy
Wow what is wrong with this lady. Her phone should not  be an issue at the point of her being arrested
"trump state, enough said"
Aren&#39;t they all entitled?
&#39;Entitled’ Ohio Woman Gets Tased After Allegedly Ramming Police Cars -&gt; Entitled Ohio Woman Gets Tased After &#39;Allegedly&#39; Ramming Police Cars<br>fixed the title for you
A straitjacket might be a handy accessory in the back of a patrol vehicle.
"What is wrong with this lady?  I do feel the police were heavy handed, but all she had to do was roll her window down and be respectful."
"She is so full of fun, lard and drugs. A keeper!"
Both need to go to jail for at least 30 years each!
That girl did NOTHING wrong but love her sister. I don’t think that cop would understand that.
I find it hard to believe that such a sweet mom would have trouble with her son&#39;s father. I believe in some cases that mental health is real...and this woman is a case.
"Cops stop bullying nice ladies! Typical, cops tormenting nice citizens!😅"
We all know she is woke 😂 she not afraid to show it
"Don&#39;t get married, don&#39;t have children and you should be fine."
Sister shouldn&#39;t have been released.
She brought All of this on herself!!!
&quot;You&#39;re under arrest!&quot;<br><br>&quot;No I&#39;m not!&quot;<br><br>Works every time.
"If you&#39;re this crazy screaming about your &#39;medicine&#39;, you shouldn&#39;t be out driving a car.  These people need babysitters."
This officer is out of control.  Taser for not going on belly isn&#39;t policing.  It is full on a-hole.
"Needing to use double cuffs because a person is so overweight that they cannot move their body normally, is sad. It also seems so common, It&#39;s a wonder they don&#39;t start standard-issuing &quot;plus sized&quot; cuffs."
"man its always the same..&quot;cop for like the 8th time. Ma&#39;am open up or im gonna do it by force.&quot; woman- &quot;...no, im busy&quot; five seconds later &quot; FOR NO REASON!!!!!!!!!&quot;"
Look what they did to me last time. You’ve got a great track record honey
So this 31 year old woman calls her sister to deliberately and deceptively start recording after she clearly drove away when denied all request to keep the male officer away to simply make it seem as if the officers were &quot;abusing her&quot; as she acts like she is terrified of them...Does this woman know both officers are also recording....
"Firearms are not yellow, and you don&#39;t call out &quot;tazer&quot; when deployed."
I&#39;m taking a poll:<br>Is this woman a maniac or<br>Is this just the everyday behavior of an American mother these days?
Someone give her her medication!
&quot;Look at my hands?&quot; Were they all nice and clean and she didn&#39;t want to have to rewash?
If her story about cops tackling her is even real then I’m willing to bed she was being difficult and uncooperative then as well.
This is what drugs do to someone else mentality.
Why are you using the word allegedly here? It&#39;s literally in the video we&#39;re watching.
Your sister came there to &quot;save you&quot;? 🤨🤣🤦🏽
The absolute stupidity of some people is amazing 😂
He did pull a gun on her. That was messed up. He quickly switched to the TASER.
Lmao that woman police officer was beyond useless
I cant stand watching anymore! No wonder shits out of hand!
Tinnitus. how many police officers have Tinnitus after an intervention like this😵‍💫
I thought pot was legal in Ohio? Kayla definately needs some!
"Dang, someone got her pregnant. Poor guy."
&quot;He needs to stay away from me&quot; <br><del>points at the female officer</del> <br>😂 <br><del>lady officer proceeds to turn into a super hero in GTA</del>
"NOW, SHE REALLY HAS PTSD"
Im glad i dont act like this thanks to my family teaching me acting like this is wrong and to act civil with the police
"Wow, how sad! My heart goes out to this young lady who obviously has some sort of mental issues. I sincerely things work out for her. I also want to commend all the Police Officers and EMS involved for their professionalism and patience while dealing with her."
"Bro literally pulled his gun on an unarmed civilian at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=328"">5:28</a>. Totally unacceptable."
Nobody’s laughing at you!  (I am! )😂
I have no clue why he wants to take the kid away.....
"Gee, I can&#39;t imagine why she thought she deserved a pass on ramming a police car!?"
"I think the new police moto should be...&quot;Act like a toddler, you&#39;re ridin&#39; with us!&quot; 🤣"
lol last time too … SHE NEEDS to STAY HOME
"She&#39;s completely unhinged,  caused this disaster of a scene with damage,  won&#39;t take accountability, and wants her kid as if thats safe. And then tries to say it&#39;s the cops fault. I don&#39;t blame the dad for keeping the kid safe. Crazy."
i guess you cant say &#39;&#39;only in ohio&#39;&#39;
What planet of delusion were these two women raised on? Just ignore and refuse orders from police and behave any crazy way you want with no.consequence?  Parents did a great job with these two. Is it too late to charge them?
"“so she’s got attempted vehicular assault, obstruction,..”<br>“YOURE LYING it’s on your bodycam!!”<br>“…yes.”🤯"
"I hope the father shows this video to the judge , they take away any custody from her , only be allowed Supervised visits  ...   OMG to have a parent like this  !!"
"Highlight of the video<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=528"">8:48</a> LOL thinks if she keeps saying &quot;LEMME GO&quot; that they will listen hahaha<br><br>Says &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything wrong&quot; after disobeying lawful commands and rammed into a police vehicle... and wrecklessly driving over a crub..   <br><br>After all that... &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything wrong!&quot;"
I seriously dont understand the screaming woman in the background?? She is literally causing herself personal trauma by freaking out..
Christ. Arrested emotional development. Our society seems to promote that.
"idk about y&#39;all, but i find it very telling as to what shes like as a mother when she says &#39;he needs to give me my son&#39; &#39;i want my son&#39; &#39;you can&#39;t take my son away from me&#39;. also, her insistence that she&#39;s not on drugs when nobody even MENTIONED drugs or alcohol is the cherry on top of what you need to know. hope her little boy is safe and okay.<br><br>update; oh she literally tattled on herself mentioning drugs before she even got charged with OVI lmao."
"31??? I clocked her at 51, easy. <br>I guess being that awful ages you."
The colored hair tells me everything I need to know about this suspect.
"You’re about to be tased, and your window smashed. What a great time to hve a conversation on your phone! 🙄"
&quot;get him away from me!!&quot; while she is the one keeping him trapped... the delusion is insane
Bad rendition of Let Me Go which was originally done by Joan Webber.
Wow and she didn&#39;t get shot and she&#39;s still alive? 🤔 Imagine that. So the police don&#39;t always have to use lethal force when their lives are actually in danger.
"What kind of a demented simpleton replies, &quot;No I&#39;m not!&quot;, to the statement, &quot;You&#39;re under arrest.&quot;?"
I&#39;m thinking her visitation with those kids didn&#39;t increase
"What I can&#39;t get is HOW would she have been able to block someone from calling the police, as alleged? I think I smell a walloping great RAT."
They really need to reopen mental health institutions
"It&#39;s funny when they ask,&quot;what did I do?&quot; Or I didn&#39;t do anything wrong&quot;."
This girl lives in a different reality. Thank you for your service officers. Sorry you have to deal with these lunatics and then go home to your normal family after that.
"welp, she&#39;s never getting her kid back now"
"This cop has anger issues, entitled or not"
&quot;you&#39;re under arrest&quot; &quot;NO I&#39;M NOT&quot; &quot;oh sorry my mistake&quot;
All this i dont trust or are afraid of cops. Is really getting old. I bet u though if she needed them for something. She wouldn&#39;t be afraid of them. Only when u r 8n trouble
When the police say to you I promise you lol your going FAFO
So we have to have adds plus listen to dude talk also. Not worth watching this channel.. extra
"I think this girl is having a nervous breakdown, it always seems like when a couple breaks up they always use the children for leverage. I really don’t know what to say but her behavior isn’t making the situation any better. It’s the children caught up in this madness that will suffer."
"Shame on that Mother,she almost hurt the officers."
Sharing a video online of a person&#39;s worse day benefits no one.  All to make a few bucks.
This is how to dig a deeper hole. Don&#39;t comply with a single order.
It&#39;s almost a guarantee that anyone who says &quot;I know my rights&quot; certainly does not.
"It’s like these people have never heard of police before, or the idea that you might be responsible if you commit a crime."
That ladycop (Olivia?) is badass. Reminds me of my sister before she quit the army and got married.
"She likes the drama and the attention of all these people, which is paid for by the taxpayer. That is why she should have to pay fines that cover the cost of all this."
Delusion is a powerful problem in that family...
Wow. She should never be left alone with kids never mind have custody over them. Mental case.
"Lol tbh, those are some cool body cams..  Friggin FPS view haha"
Somebody had a child with her. The nightmare.
Why is it okay for the officers to use the F bomb?
The male officer seriously  gave that other women who interfered a critical learning experience 👌 that situation would have been bad- super bad
"Why are they picking on that poor,  innocent lady? She cooperated with all your commands. I want your badge #.......<br>😂"
"A law firm as a sponsor for these police videos ---- gee, thanks."
why do the Officers waste that much Time with Psychos ??? that &quot;Entity&quot; shouldn´t even be allowed to drive ... or vote or have Children
"Bad girls, bad girls, whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?"
I wish you needed to pass exams and gain a licence to procreate
she needs to be locked up like right now
You ran me over.  You hit my cruiser? lol  She&#39;s nuts but neither of those things happened
That poor man dealing with this crazy lady
"Rams cop cruisers and says get away from me, smh"
"&quot;you&#39;re under arrest!&quot;<br>&quot;no, I&#39;m not!&quot;<br>&quot;oh ok, sorry ma&#39;am.&quot;"
Holy Crap.<br><br>You Block Out The Tazer<br>You Block Out The Car Ramming<br>You Block Out So Much<br><br>WTH Happened With You Guys?
I believe this is why handcuffs and duct tape were invented.
Nothing is EVER her fault is it!
and she wonders why she cant see her kids
That woman is a couple of sandwiches short of a picnic.
Sooooooo avoidable. Do you really need to make a bad day a worse one?
I hope they don’t give that baby back to her! Smh
The judge says who gets custody of the kids.
This is how I behave on GTA 5 🥴
"people today cannot release the phone, its like a cant live without body part"
The sister crying 😂😂
Just one question why are people like this
I love these head mounted body cameras btw
31???? She looks 48
Who should stay away from who?
I wanna see the court hearings!!!
when keeping it real goes wrong
"This is not fair. she is afraid and scared. or she might just be insecure. this is insane. i hate this. tell me if im wrong, in fact she did nothing, she did not touch any car. this is insane"
I can&#39;t imagine how she lost custody in the first place.
bro stop advertising mid video
Why does she keep repeating every word?
I want to know where all these people came up with this idea that they do not have to listen to the police when they’re pulled over for committing a crime or anything else. There’s nothing in the constitution that says that they do not have to give their information to the police nothing but yet they all say it’s  in the constitution is not.
"Kayla, kayla, kayla. You want your son back? This is NOT how its going to happen. If anything youve just prolonged that one. Now on top of stopping your sons dad from filing YET ANOTHER COMPLAINT against you, you have resisting arrest, assault on a police officer, as well as using your vehicle as a weapon basically. Idk who her therapist or what they told her today but surely it wasnt &quot;Kayla go down to the court house and act like a fool&quot; she dont need no more of her medicine bc ITS NOT WORKING!!"
It’s always the tears for me!! Why not do as asked immediately?!
How do  people get this psychotic to begin with?   Jeeez.
Did I just here her say don&#39;t try and turn this around on me?
"The American police!<br><b>Simply, always, and EVERYWHERE!</b>"
Allegedly?
"Dang, it was like trying to get a witch into church!"
Allegedly?
Because of videos like this I no longer take any woman crying seriously. Always fake and for their advantage.
The drama with this one is strong. . .
Choose your partner wisely folks.
And that people is called &quot;privilege&quot;
yt trash
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=782"">13:02</a> - no lady, YOU have to understand not to act like a fool"
Where do people like this come from?
its not &quot;allegedly&quot; when its on 4k video
Bring back mental asylums
"Always, everyone else&#39;s fault!"
31? she looks 41
My hometown hasn’t changed much
UNBELIEVABLE!
It&#39;s always Ohio or Florida 😂
Get on your belly ! Which one?
She should’ve just complied!!!!
&quot;life&#39;s choices&quot; had me rolling lol
"If she’s really going through what she says, she’s going through, I feel sorry. But unfortunately, you have to adhere to the police, and what they’re asking you to do. You have to get out of a car. You have to listen. Otherwise, unfortunately, we just cannot feel sorry for you. And you look like the guilty party."

No wonder she can&#39;t see her kid
Officer was pretty cool....
I know how the Father feels. He is embarrassed and humiliated because he is on display to the whole world as the guy who got involved with this maniac. This is what happens when little head vetoes the brain. Lots of men have been where you are. Me included.
31 years old? Meth is hella drug.
I couldn&#39;t do this job.  Kudos to the men and women in blue!
All look how they deal with them when they act crazy and misbehave 🤔🙄
"Caught a $100,000 bond."
These videos just infuriate me. There are so many in our society that contribute nothing but require everything.
Another ignorant Karen
Trailer nonsense
They so use too being privileged so when shiz happens they can’t handle it
I hope they show the kids this video.
"&quot;But at least she didn&#39;t cause a scene and went peacefully U Guise!!&quot; 🤔<br>Yeah, uh, right. What an immature womyn."
"i fully believe she got tackled and roughed up the week before, what did she think happened when u acted like this towards cops"
"Criminal crying victim, you need to follow instructions from the police"
I feel SO SORRY for LEOS!!
I do not understand why people say they dont trust cops when all they have to do is listen to them! Just do what they say and it wont escalate.  What are peole thinking
She is the perpetual victim. Everyone is abusing her. No accountability for her own entitled actions.
Perpetual victim.
&quot;tasered me&quot;
"It&#39;s everyone Fault but hers, right?<br>I bet she was a well pampered Child who doesn&#39;t have faced any Consequences for her Action, and now she is a &quot;grown&quot; &quot;Adult&quot; who thinks the World resolve around her.<br>To sad."

That&#39;s most of Ohio woman ♀️
Trying to keep the phone in her hand was just absurd.  She’s crazier than a loon.

"OMG, some people really think they&#39;re the eternal victim. Wow. Lady, please get some therapy. You need it."
i hope everyone she knows sees this.
i&#39;m not doing anything.. famous last wrods
"She says, &quot;You guys do this every time....&quot; as if regular run-ins with the law like this are the norm for everyone 😂<br>Girl, the longest interaction I&#39;ve ever had with police is when one happened to be driving behind me which resulted in a surge of anxiety and my bum remaining clenched till I pulled in my garage 😅 (... and no, he never pulled me over. I think he followed me for a total of, 8 - 10 seconds before he turned off the road)"
"Cop: Get out of the car or you will be arrested”<br>Woman:No<br>Cop: repeats it 100 times <br>Woman:No<br>Cop:Ok<br><br>Wow, a minority dude would’ve been pulled out after the 2nd request and had knee on his back for 30 mins…"

You lost me with the ad.
Why did you do this? Real narcissistic statement. I didn&#39;t have anything to do with the situation so ome one else made me do it.. Crazy!

"I’m always excited when I see you’ve uploaded a new video, you never disappoint!"
"There&#39;s NOOOOO way, she isn&#39;t suffering from some kind of mental health situation... <br>Like really, I&#39;m not being mean when I say this, but I just Can&#39;t see a sane person thinking this wasn&#39;t the consequences of THEIR ACTIONS."
Why is entitled in quotes in the title? The title also states &quot;Allegedly&quot; after IT&quot;S ON VIDEO!!!!!! Hahahahaha! SuperSimp away! Hahahahahah!
The many ADS made this video unwatchable... LESS ADS NEXT TIME
Police Horror. To much crying. Unprofessional police officers. Never would happen in an European country.
"I&#39;m not familiar with OVI, what is it?"
"That male cop failed miserably the De-escalation department, bigtime!!! 🤨"
"Videos like this make the sale of MOTHERS DAY,&quot;THANK YOU&quot; Cards skyrocket way before mothers day."
"“Keep him away from me”, “keep him away from her”…lady you blocked HIM in while HE was trying to file a report. Probably cause you’re a massive psychopath. If there were ever a way to ensure that the ex you hate keeps custody, this would be it."
"Die  ist doch  selbst Schuld  ,was hat ihr  das ganze  Theater  gebracht? Außer  das sie im Internet  ist"
The thing in the red car is A COMPLETE WASTE OF EVERYTHING THAT MAKES A HUMAN A HUMAN.
Liberals.
This mental health act is ridiculous! She just wants everything her way!
I’d like to know what meds she’s on.
"You smashed into two police cars and almost ran over an officer, but you’re not under arrest? Seems legit.🤦‍♀️"
She made things worse. I don&#39;t understand why she didn&#39;t get out the car when the officer asked.
By no means is any fit to have custody any child her own parents failed her
"I truly feel sorry for all the service Personel involved with this Violent, abusive woman. The screaming and the  waste of Public Emergency Services and Law enforcers is ridiculous and she needs to be accountable and do pay back in Community Service. She thinks by screaming and yelling , its OK. I am glad I am not in the Forces . The sheer stress she created on the Law Enforcers is unacceptable. How do the Law and Emergency Service cope at the end of the day. I couldnt cope with that disgusting woman. John (Australia)"
"Pretty obvious that she is very scared of the police from previous interaction with them. She might have mental issues. Contrary to what you all people think, the way the police are treating her is NOT the way to treat a person with mental problems. Then the other woman tries to help her and the police treat her badly too. She needs to take medication prescribed by a Doctor, she is also denied this. I&#39;m sorry to disagree with all you people but I think that the entire situation was NOT handled properly by the police, and then the police tell her they will drag her out if necessary, she is already very scared of them."
No wonder he don&#39;t want her around their kid (which it sounded like was the case)
"And trust me, she doesn&#39;t want her son. She doesn&#39;t want to pay child support. She wants to punish this man, get child support, and turn the kid against his father. Adding another unhappy person to an unhappy bunch of people as it is. She is a sad example of the mother.....shame."
W T F is her problem &amp; theirs for even playing with her for that long?! Just goes to show… nvm.
&quot;You are under arrest!&quot;  &quot;No I&#39;m not&quot;  New rules guys! It&#39;s only to adjust the law.
"Congrats Kayla, now you never kid your and this video lives online for ALL your family, friends and future employers to see!"
"As a teacher, this is why I try so hard to teach my kids to take responsibility and move on. Everything is not worth a fight. This could’ve all been prevented with a little compliance. No need to admit guilt, but being aggressive isn’t gonna get you anyone."
"She said “you guys did it again!” as if she did nothing to warrant being tased. 😂😂 Girl what?? If she just got jumped on a week prior by law enforcement, she was probably behaving the same way then too."
Where are ALL the anti-cop YouTube subscribers yapping about this woman&#39;s &quot;rights&quot;? HAHA!!
Adventures with the &quot;WHACKO SISTERS&quot;!   &quot;Goodbye!&quot;   I feel very sorry for her husband and son as nobody deserves her in their lives.
Entitled woman. This was completely 100% your own fault and I guess the previous altercation was too.
"Every time a video starts with someone saying they don’t trust cops cuz of bad past experiences, I know they are going to resist arrest and blame the police. <br><br>Say it with me “Ther-a-py.”"
The number of people who think legal procedure is dictated by their perceived comfort level is astounding.
"I don&#39;t know how the police put up with people like this on a daily basis. The cop says he has dealt with her a million times...but of course, this isn&#39;t her fault"
"Officer: Your under arrest<br>Woman: No I&#39;m not! <br>Officer: OH OK then , have a nice day"
"K-9 • first the sister, then the lunatic. My goodness, the lunatic has a child. That’s a Code-10 travesty."
I don&#39;t think her auto insurance company will pay for the damages to the police vehicles.
She got tased twice and it&#39;s like nothing!!! Aren&#39;t tased people a bit druggy after ?
It was hilarious 😊when they told her they would cut the handbag off her when she screamed “No!  It’s Baragoni!”😂
"I feel very sorry for her young child..  Seems as if mental illness may run in that family... What a totally over the top disgraceful performance.. The Police officers all showed extreme patience, and acted professionally.. ..  She certainly needs her &#39;medication&#39; as she claimed to the medics.."
Raty than promoting yourself you might start to think about your own safety.<br>Advertising crap.
&gt; the sheriff says you can’t do anything<br><br>Im gonna guess he probably didn’t say that
They should have rock paper scissors who she goes with
"The main take away I’ve gotten from any of these videos is to just listen and obey with the cops. Don’t spiral, just follow instructions. Most people don’t like to do that. 🤷🏼‍♀️"
what she really thinking when she said to cop staying away from me???????
Screaming like that in public should be a misdemeanor at the very least. Causing unnecessary alarm with the result of bringing about public discomfort.
"Poor kids, they should have been sent to their room. Not thrown out into the cold. It was late, why were they so hungry. Parents withholding food as punishment too.<br>Hope the court orders regular check ups on this family to protect the kids.  Thanks Officers!💔⚖️"
"MAYBE if she had taken her meds when she was supposed to, this incident MIGHT have been avoided (but probably not)."
Allegedly!? Really.  Body cams DO NOT lie. Like it or not.  That&#39;s why they are  worn by the most scrutinized.
"Men you better pay attention, do you think if this was you, you would have had this level of patience? Would you think the video would have edit you being tased?"
"CDC, Peer Support, Trauma Informed Care…nothing is more important to someone entering into recovery than the confiscation of their cell phones. It’s a tragic loss of priorities. Grow up. I’ve seen people beat heroin sooner than their phone addiction."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=358"">5:58</a> Allegedly? My brother in Christ I watched it happen"
I&#39;m guessing the therapy/counseling didn&#39;t work.
"When a suspect refuses to get out of a car, I always wonder why the officers don&#39;t just leave them in there.  If they sit there for a couple of days, they will eventually come out to get water or food, won&#39;t they?  Chocks could be put under the wheels so that the car doesn&#39;t go anywhere.  Voila!  They get out."
She’s 31?!?….Yikes. Looks like a bad 10 mi of broken RR Tracks
"If Kayla &quot;pinned him in&quot; his car by blocking his driver&#39;s side door, I am wondering if he could not have just slid over to the passenger side door to get out. Inquiring minds want to know.<br><br>A note about the cops:  I have noticed that in a lot of these types of videos, officers are swearing quite often - isn&#39;t that considered unprofessional?   If things are getting out of hand, swearing and insulting people is not the way to de-escalate situations.  That seems like common sense to me.  No wonder so many people absolutely loathe the police."
"To my surprise, the young officer who appeared in the video was a police sergeant. At first glimpse, I thought he was a rookie."
&lt;watching video&gt;<br>&quot;Hey everybody...&quot;<br>&lt;Skip ahead&gt;
Why is that cop screaming like that? The lady did it almost run the female officer over that’s all BS. That cop is screaming. Like an unhinged lunatic. He has no business with a taser or a firearm in his hand. Acting like that he supposed to D escalate not escalate Screaming at the top of his lungs. What does that accomplish? I mean the girls should be arrested but I don’t think it helps matters with him yelling at her like that. He definitely needs more training on de-escalation or he needs to find another job because he’s gonna hurt somebody And he’s a liar that woman was nowhere near running someone over.
&quot;You can&#39;t take my son and my dramamine&quot;. GREAT LINE!
"Such a crazy whack job.  Look at the damage the resources to control the nutcase, and the damages $$ all in like 20 mins of chaos.  I feel deeply saddened for emergency services having to risk their lives dealing with this type of risk &amp; attitude, the woman has clearly never been told no."
The entitlement on this lady. Blaming the cops after she rammed both cruisers and wouldn’t listen. 🙄
"Screaming not to let the male near her, you are not allowed to touch me, I don’t feel safe. All the tag lines of victimhood. Next she will claim she has ptsd so she is not responsible. Everyone has ptsd now which angers me because it minimizes the people who truly have PTSD from serious abuse, torture, and war."
Honestly don’t know how these police officers deal with this stuff
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=1264"">21:04</a> that&#39;s some sitcom comedy right there<br>Officer: &quot;...*sighs*.... it&#39;s my car isn&#39;t it?&quot;"
Reminds me of my ex sister-in-law another Ohio resident. Some people just don&#39;t see fair or think they should be responsible for their actions. I would hate to have to deal with her again if I were an officer there. Entitled doesn&#39;t begin to explain this.
I&#39;m confused. Where exactly does this video show what she &quot;allegedly&quot; did before cops came?
Uhhh...does she really think this is going to help her custody case? The entire episode&#39;s been filmed and will surface in any child custody case.
Is that a thing to just not roll your windows down and your magicly don’t have to comply with police’s
Also that other girl screaming bloody murder in the background is making things worse not better. She sounds like a psychopath
Obey law in for cement and you won&#39;t have any problems.
Gaslighting don&#39;t fall for the fake tears The get out of trouble escape clause playing the victim.
"She clearly can&#39;t be allowed to drive, if she thinks it&#39;s acceptable to throw a tantrum using her vehicle as a battering ram. What a clown."
This woman should eventually only have supervised visitations with her young child. Her behavior is dangerous and horrendous.
"Howard Stern show listerners, its Morgan &amp; Morgan! Ronnie, you out there? You on scene? lmao"
"I like how determent the officer acts, avoiding endless discussions. Well done. 👋"
"Definition of &quot;entitled&quot; is really starting to branch out, huh? Usually it means rich people who think laws don&#39;t apply to them. Not mentally unstable people who need a dose of their medication asap"
Is the &quot;allegedly&quot; just for legal reasons or is this ongoing? Bc im pretty sure we saw the whole thing
"She almost makes me reconsider my stance against police brutality. (Also, I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be getting her kid back anytime soon!)"
"&quot;Lady i did nothing, i didn&#39;t run try run into anyone&quot;  yeah lady plenty of proof proving otherwise.  That being said i do hope she gets help in the future because i do think their&#39;s somthing wrong with her."
People are so f&#39;ing spoiled....how crazy 😧😧😧
Playing a victim doesn’t work well when you have child custody!
"She does all that and blames the police. Kayla is a professional victim who’s parents never told her no. “This is what happens every time”.  We have a generation of people who can’t function in society, don’t contribute and never will."
"If she is trying to get custody of her son, I think she just blew it big time. She was acting crazy. Any judge or jury is going to see this video and deny her custody. She is complaining about getting the same treatment as she got last time. What does she really expect? What is the definition of insanity? Doing the same thing over and over but expecting a different outcome."
Poor upbringing.
I find it hard to believe she doesn&#39;t have custody of this child. Anyone wanna guess how many kid&#39;s she&#39;s lost custody of. I know for a fact how many. <br><br><br><br>Everyone that slid or fell out.
What country would tolerate this anarchist behaviors.  The police in other countries would have dealt with this very violently. Nobody tolerates this bull.
This is like the 4th video I&#39;ve seen of this woman. I&#39;m pretty sure the situation she was talking about being &quot;tackled&quot; by police before is also on yt somewhere.
This crazy woman shouldn’t have custody of a goldfish let alone a child.
👮- you&#39;re under arrest<br>Karen the 🤡  -no I&#39;m not<br><br> 🤦‍♀️ do they grow people like that?
Listen up he’s informing you to get out of her car.  People are so ignorant today.  Absolutely no respect for the law incredible.
"Umm. I&#39;m pretty sure everything the officers said was a lie. When did she assault one of them, I must have blinked during that one.She didn&#39;t try to run from the police, she didn&#39;t try to run any of them over, and she didn&#39;t actually hit either of the cruisers. Oh yeah, and her sister wasn&#39;t interfering with the investigation, as soon as the officer told her to back up, she did right away. There is nothing the sister did that was illegal, she was a safe distance away from anyone, and never tried to attack, or run up on anyone. The police car that actually did get hit, was the officers fault. she moved her car over so her ex couldn&#39;t leave, and the female officer was standing on the side of the car when the suspect tried to move her car. Then when the male officer shattered her window, she jumped away from the glass and was scarred, all while the car wasn&#39;t put back into park yet. so when he scarred her and she jumped to the other side, she took her foot off the brake, and ended up rolling forward. So it&#39;s kind of his fault. And she didn&#39;t hit his car, he&#39;s just adding that on, to make her look bad, and give her more charges. Probably didn&#39;t help the situation that she was pregnant also."
I’m confused what the initial issue was with all the commotion 😂 What happened last week?
YAY to that officer not taking any BS from I think Kayla? Great Job at getting it done proper!!!!❤❤❤
You know what I&#39;ve learned from these video&#39;s? If you keep insisting your not under arrest the cops get baffled and just let you go.
Sister&#39;s cut from the same cloth. Seems like it runs in the family!
&quot;Allegedly rammed a cruiser&quot;?<br><br>Did the narrator not watch the video?
He can’t take my son she says. Lady he’s not just your son it’s his as well. You don’t own your child. Your child is not property of as a lot of women think.
I like the cop that was no playing. Didn&#39;t talk gor 30 mins he just moved her. Give him a promotion
"Morgan and Morgan are just a clearinghouse for calls. They take your info and send you to a local law firm. I worked with the lawyer they sent me to for 9 months. After that time, they said that the amount of compensation they would get wasn’t enough to continue with the case.  Rip off."
"lol, ask a cop if he/she knows what common sense is...<br>i am sure, they never heard the words &quot;common sense &quot;!"
I’ve been through this with my ex attacking me during custody battle. But back then the courts look at the father as just an atm no rights. The cop just laughed at me when I tried to file a complaint.
&quot;I am not doing anything&quot;. A constant refrain for perps actively resisting arrest. Somebody should turn this into a rap song.
You know the ex husband wished he pulled out years ago…! 😂
They need to learn how to de-escalate. And sometimes it simply by not interacting and talking with the person you&#39;re arresting..
&quot;Entitled woman gets tased&quot;<br><br><b>Law and Crime edits out the footage of the tase</b><br><br>This channel sucks.
Calling the cops abusers when she could have killed someone is a wild accusation.
"Talk about delusional, it just never ends with these people.  What part of reality do you not understand?  🤔"
If this kind of thing happens to you every week then maybe it&#39;s you
She refused to cooperate and then got tased and played the victim. The cop asked her to get out of her car for 5 minutes. He was quite patient with her already.
That dad needs to warn the son&#39;s school about her. Wouldn t put it past her to try a kidnap. How did she know her ex would be there that morning? Is she stalking him?
My daughter’s 15 yo best friend has a therapist to have to deal with having a mother like this.  Do better as a parent!!!
"That&#39;s not &quot;allegedly&quot; we all saw it happen, it&#39;s not like it&#39;s up for debate."
I had to go back bc i thought he said &quot;Unfortunately i havent shot anybod&quot;
Tell sister to obey ..the police manipulator …sister needs to go ..BS
"Oh man, I just wanted to scream at her “Shut the F up!”<br><br>I hope her sister learned her lesson and appreciates she was allowed to leave."
"I am sorry, but the other girl running up to the cops when things got heated and escalated. When she was in the cop car freaking out and the cop said &quot;Did you learn your lesson?&quot; I lost it xD"
What a couple of lovely sisters! Their parents must be so proud.
What mickey mouse department is this. Once the cuffs go on thats it. You don&#39;t let the sister go.
"Too many warnings. The woman was a loose cannon which could result in unknown outcomes. Simple, follow direction or go to jail, full stop."
No woman should be a frontline officer always yelling commands from behind the male officers..
You know what the funny thing is in the end? The innocent guy filing the report probably went and filed the report anyway. :P
She actually thinks that she gets to go to jail with her phone. She thinks she is just entitled and the victim when she faces the consequences of her actions.
I see privilege. Nothing happened to them/her just talked to fussing back and forth even after hitting police car she is still her to see another day with all her entitlement
If she&#39;s currently in therapy and she acts like this.....what is the therapist doing?!
"She is definitely unreasonable and terrifed and dangerous, but the officers need to take some deescalation courses.  Arguing with her is not going to get you anywhere."
Morgan and Morgan literally are the public defenders of lawyers.
The lady cop keeps saying the perp tried to hit her cruiser. So why did she gate to run in the opposite direction to get her car? I didn’t see anywhere to show the sauces was assaulting the Frankie cop. Freaking ridiculous.
I dont think that guy needs to file the police report now.  Its very obvious she&#39;s guilty<br><br>Also i really hope he kid wasnt in the car with her to witness all this.
"Olivia&#39;s bodycam is awesome, getting to see her perspective."
Cant show us the tazer moment and you add an ad right before it...? Dislike.
unfortunately there are too many people that are nuts. And unfortunately cops have to deal with them.
"I&#39;m sure I just watched this woman in another video, where she ran into the back of another vehicle, wasn&#39;t that bad of a crash, but she screamed at the officers &amp; was totally unhinged!"
How&#39;s she having a driving license? Or the car? She&#39;s an accident waiting to happen.
"I understand, that the police broke the window, but why not on the passenger side and why are they using their gun instead of a taeser of pepperspray!?"
"The more I see of those vids from the americans, the more I&#39;m surprised the cops seem to be able to contain themselves lel.<br><br>Some people, oh boi. Our species sucks."
What a mess. My gosh. Like what are you even doing. She better stay single forever. This is scary. I hope my son stays away from these girls
never getting her kid back. and rightfully so.
Shut the door quit talking to her ..make her stand accountable..
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=330"">5:30</a> notice how quickly she opens the door after getting that THANG pointed at her"
"Yep, typical - act badly while simultaneously screaming lies about it the whole time."
Comical how some people would defend this women purely because they dislike cops
"Didn&#39;t the male cop overreact, they are always so quick to get violent.  She seemed to have mental issues and the female was deescalating, then old macho male cop gets violent."
She was acting like a spoiled brat and wouldn&#39;t let go of her cell phone
She belongs in prison. She is a danger to society. She is even harassing the medics.
What a perfect role model  for her son.  The sister obstructed and also should have been arrested.  Funny how the guilty always turn the blame onto the wrong person.  One characteristic of a narcissist.
"She thinks drama and tears, while acting like a threat to police, is gonna matter. This generation is just ridiculous."
These people are nuts..
"My goodness, this women"
Young people have no respect at all and these lawyers are helping this world become so unsafe.  That woman is so wrong how she is acting.  She needs a year on jail.  That is what really needs to be done.
"You are resisting, if she just listened to the cops, there wouldn&#39;t be a problem. Never resist the cops."
"From seeing this incident that she created all on her own, I don’t feel she deserves to have responsibility for a child. She was more concerned about her medicine than the fact that she most definitely won’t get her child back."
"While she&#39;s is crazy and in the wrong, the cops did a terrible job of apprehending her."
Anyone know what Camera&#39;s and Voice Recorder&#39;s that they use?
Do the cops get paid extra for wrangling up cows?🤣
as a Woman in America it is extremely hard to lose custody of ur child. I was curious why the son didn;t want to talk to her as she mentioned in the first few minutes. Now it all makes sense
"&quot;You guys knew what you were doing the whole time!&quot; Yeah, their job 😅"
Lol😮😂 they always turn into toddler&#39;s 😂
She was charged with OVI so she was intoxicated or high on drugs.
REALLY DECENT FOR LETTING THE OTHER LADY GO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES...
Police have got to stop babysitting. Their inaction could have turned this into a very serious matter.
"the female police officer was handling well, then the male officer just completely lost it!"
&quot;This is what happens every time!&quot; Yeah lady I bet! 😂😂😂
"I almost thought the cops had her son at the beginning , “stay away from me” girl they gotta talk to you 😂😂😂 like you have absolutely no say in this matter"
Does anybody know the brand/name of that &quot;headcam&quot;? I&#39;ve never seen one before in use by law enforcement
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=329"">5:29</a> my favorite part cause she wanna play games and I get to see her scared shitless cause of it 🤣"
Not finished with theraphy-dede.
Why do the cops continue to argue with a distressed crazed person? Let her go on and on. Do not participate in ongoing nonsense rebuttals
What a sorry sad person. U won’t get your child back acting like that
The emotional trauma this father has been going thru dealing with a crazy ex wife
I don&#39;t know the law. Is the officer allowed to break her window just because he wanted her to step out of the vehicle?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=174"">2:54</a> non obbediscono perché sono traumatizzati da poliziotti violenti: in tantissimi casi succede questo, mi sembra evidente che da parte dei cittadini non vi sia nessuna fiducia verso la polizia, e considerando le immagini hanno ragione al 💯"
That is one sturdy dress. Not one boob popped out 😂
Cops have a lot of patience cuz I couldn&#39;t deal with that crazy s***
She was so willing to hit people but wants them to baby her.. people have become so entitled and thank they are above the rules and laws.
The way that lady cop was running...how did she pass the exams? lol
"&quot;This always happens to me&quot;<br><br>Well yes, because you always act like a this 🙄🙄🙄"
this is what happens when drugs become more and more common. and schools teach students to fear the police
Its so funny when the cops say “get on your belly” and the belly is big lol
This woman is priceless. She’s either off her meds or taken too many
But I saw on Facebook I don’t have to get out of the car if ordered by police
"First rule: don’t argue with someone who is out of control. Bring her to magistrate, get her in jail."
"“You need to stay away from me” <br><br>Sure ma’am, sorry to disturb you, we are going on our away. You have a great day now ;)"
"Props to that female officer, she was so composed and did everything to de-escalate"
The epitome of chutzpah: She rams cop cars and still plays the victim.
"Another frequent flier, gets situation escalated to a felony charge."
LOL why was she holding her flip flop while getting outta the car 😂😂
Over n over n over. Enough. I hope your as patient with your wife.
Alliance is not a big town. This is half the force I think.
Horrible to hear. TRAUMA TRAINING GET IT -
Colored hair indicates the high probability they will be resisting arrest.
crazy thing is she will prolly get the kid back when she gets out with how the court system is
“its my cruiser isn’t it” bro was in disbelief 😭😭😭😭😭
She just won her husbands case for him. Hope the husband got a recording
I bet she calls herself a &quot;Christian&quot; too! She has no clue she has done anything wrong and never will 😐
Why when they are on the ground handcuffed and the officer says you are under arrest they always say no I&#39;m not.
They listen to bad YouTube lawyer.
This is a disgrace.  We wouldnt handle a woman who is so disturbed like that in the uk .😮
What is wrong with people. They don’t pay cops enough to handle this nonsense.
What a bunch of losers.
You know sad thing is other colors would’ve been shot
Do not let her have unsupervised visits I would think she would be the type to harm her son.
Amazing how long cops let these people throw a fit before taking action.
You just lost all your children in this life and the next. You won&#39;t even be able to say words that start with c anymore
&quot;You&#39;ve delt with me a million times.&quot; Tells us all we need to know.<br><br>Hope little sis learned her lesson. 😔
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=342"">5:42</a> I don&#39;t think getting on her belly is going to help these LEO&#39;S. She&#39;d still be close to eye level with them."
"I feel sorry for the guy, She&#39;s clearly an abuser who then flips it onto her partner."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=310"">5:10</a> bro hit his best Homelander impersonation 😂😂😂"
Those are the consequences for doing your own will.
"You’re under arrest. <br><br>No I’m not. <br><br>Oh. Off you go, then."
"&quot;They busted my face&quot;  No ma&#39;am, it was already like that."
&quot;This happens to me every time..!&quot; Well.... duh.
&quot;Allegedly&quot; ramming? We all saw it...duh!
I call BS
I think this kind of people are lacking in emotional support
just show the full video. we dont need ur explanation and u keep rewinding it jeez!!
So glad the child is hopefully safe from that fruit cake
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=1280"">21:20</a>. <br><br>&quot;its on your bodycam&quot;<br><br>stops mid sentence &quot;yes&quot;"
entitled princess
You&#39;re going to jail....NO I&#39;M NOT !!🤣
after witnessing this does anyone need an explanation as to why the guy was trying to file a police report?
she almost hit OLIVIA. yeah where ??? XD
She doesn’t need to have any custody of her son. Perhaps not even supervised visitation at this point.
What a weak generation.
They cant tase her for refusing to lay on the ground🙄These cops are power hungry
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=136"">2:16</a> the crying strategy is called upon..."
lies to me that female officer were nowhere near being run over. americans like over reacting
"All you had to say was Ohio,  I didn&#39;t need the whole story."
Cant imagine why she would loose her kids....
They need to stop arguing with her tell her her rights and then do your jobs
She&#39;s well qualified for some prison time.
Is it me or did the initial  5 knocks on her window tickle you? 😂😂😂😂😂4
I wonder why the husband left her
"I hope she gets felony charges. At the very least, one year behind bars."
Lol. Telling the cops what to do. She is acting like a child
Why do people make it worse on themselves? All they have  to do is cooperate!
"It is a sign of late thinking on her part, really it is obvious!"
She is reacting to trauma. You are cauausng cause she is trying to save her son
72 hour hold for 5150 evaluation!
What&#39;s with all the tats on the cop?That looks so unprofessional.
I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t let her go when she told them she isn&#39;t under arrest
This is so sad but no way she&#39;s in the right state to be around any person let alone her own son. It&#39;s so sad man.
No wonder her husband don&#39;t want her to have the kid she&#39;s crazy
I swear these resistant and entitled people live for the drama.
"It seems the more rights people get, the worse they behave, what a waste of time having to deal with crap like that"
She aimed her phone&#39;s paralysis beam at the officer to no effect.
Yooo that cop was on 1000 since the beginning he didn&#39;t deescalate at all
well its pretty clear why you don&#39;t have your son
"Folks in Ohio, have went,Kra,Kra!!!;"
she probably tells everyone she meets about this.
Im pretty sure the police DO NOT want too touch her.
She brought all this on herself. She&#39;s no victim here
Someone is actually married to that? Maybe a mom?
Cops are awesome when they are given their rights to enforce
Let’s face it. Cops live for a day like this.
No meds
wonder how the dad (dads do not get custody easily) got the custody
imagine this level of insanity im sorry for the man in this relationship
Allegedly?
This was handled so wrong all of it...small town cops show off.
I&#39;ve never seen an entitled man. Wonder why.
That baby daddy must have been out of his mind drunk!
"That poor officer: &quot;This is MY car, isn&#39;t it?&quot; 😆"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=141"">2:21</a> shes already going for the razzie!"
I think i know why she cant see her kid.
"What kind of medication has she got, that she hasn&#39;t been taking?"
this is what it must be like for zoo keepers to put elephants back in their cages
"She was panicking, i heard the child in the back screaming i need to calm her down. I know she&#39;s in wrong here but wtf man have some humanity"
GROW UP! STOP SCREAMING 😱
Omg is the car ok?
BS
Sister should have been arrested.
Better than Netflex.
Stand there and repeat yourself officer ..please ..making you look weak…please ..freaking manipulate the situation…dictating the situation the women …know what they are doing ..repeating yourself over over over over over over over …finally doing what you said …
i would taken both of them too jail the other one girl will do it again and interfering makes it dangerous for us officer&#39;s
"I am not doing anything, you guys did it again. I need my medacation its not working"
Police brutality the second tase her hands were behind her the police also ignore that she said she was cut
OF COURSE ITS OHIO
"No sé qué habrá hecho esa mujer,pero la profesionalidad y el abuso de la fuerza por parte de la policía,solo delata su falta de recursos profesionales y nunca podrían ejercer en un estado de derecho como Europa."
How did this nice cool guy get tied up with that horse?
"Get away from me, get away from me. Stf with that!!"
Fine police work!!!
He wanted to taze her. But I don&#39;t blame him
why waste all your time on her when other people need help who are mentally stable
"is it me but people with color in there hair seems to be out of it , they need help"
why were the taser sectioned skipped?
Her sister is cute I don’t see how the other one looks like that lol 😆
Drama Queen..
Generations of substance abuse...
The key is don&#39;t resist. But I love it when people try to resist.
You guys there is at least one other video of her causing a ruckus!
The cops are 100 percent right  said  over 10 times get out of car
This can&#39;t be in Ohio - she wasn&#39;t Haitian or even eating a cat.
How many cops n police cars does it take to arrest one women 😮
Maaaan Safelite autoglass is making a killing from these.
👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾 👏🏾
Not one time have you heard them say stop resisting  😂😂
<b>Rams her car into his</b> then acts scared for her life😂😂
"Careful where you put it, fellas. Some of them have teeth."
She seems more scared of the teaser than the firearm 😅
"Didn&#39;t she tell him when he walked away, to keep her away?"
"Best part was &quot;is this a learning experience?&quot; at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=790"">13:10</a>"
Oh drama queen 😂😂😂😂you should not have your son...
What part of open the window did she not understand 🤔
We have raised a bunch of children to be terrible adults.
Cop should just do his damn job and not play mind games.
Not really a surprise they took her kid from her 🙄
Her sister says a lot about that side of the family. Lol
"She did do a lot wrong, but that one cop also went too far."
The most unsatisfying taser video on the internet.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=1266"">21:06</a>  &quot;this is my car isn&#39;t it?&quot; Is so hysterical 😂"
and this is why shes not allowed to have her kids LOL
These last two generations are a serious problem
She said you can’t take my son and my cat from me 😂
the term &quot;entitled&quot; truly is justified here....
this woman is out to lunch
People like this have no respect for authority.
She’s such a poor victim boohoo 😂😂😂😂😂
thats someones mother jfc
Well i guess we know why she doesn&#39;t have her son
She has “interesting reasoning abilities….  😮
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Allegedly? I guess I can&#39;t trust my lying eyes.
And she wants her children!  I think not!!!!
imagine being 31 years old looking like that.
"With women(?) like that, who needs toilet paper?"
WTF happened to Ohio?
Of course it is in Ohio.  Crazy people there.
She&#39;s gonna be calling Morgan and Morgan!
My son is dealing with a psychopath like this. Unfortunately the courts aren&#39;t much help until it too late.
She definitely ain’t getting her son back …
Omg the sound editing made this horrifying
Pink hair. Psycko. Which political party?
He would have been tased me n bust the windows
"I was considering moving back to Ohio from California but maybe not. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1z2h6a-Coo&amp;t=138"">2:18</a>"
Since when are duty weapons yellow? 🤔🤔
The eye of the tiger and the IQ of a peanut
"When the cops call for backup, its a bad sign"
Trash don&#39;t fall far from the trailor park
What happened after her arrest? Any update?
Feeling a lot of contempt for this woman rn
Quick thinking by cop lady to block her in
Those Karen tears didn&#39;t work this time.
Wow crocodile tears for the female officer.
I don’t think that dress is working for her
"Well, that didn&#39;t go as she planned . . ."
Imagine you have to come home to this...
She is a poster child of why drugs are bad🙄
Your son doesnt want to talk to you😂😂😂
These people sometimes
that&#39;s sad she just wanted her kids... 😢
Straight jacket and padded cell......
Is this what participation awards gets us?
i guess now she loses custody for sure now
snowbunnies are so entitled and spoiled
Tell me again...why can&#39;t she see her son?
All she had to do was just get out of the car.
Since police officers are part of family called society. Then we clearly see trend of entitled people on the raise including officers. Try to talk one after his shift he/she will act like entitled ken/karen as well. Problem is we are going high-wire for some reason and it&#39;s unstoppable process :&gt;
Somebody has never been told no before.
cop with the beard is not helping anyone
They will let you go once your charged.
Entitled kids become entitled adults
greasy nightmare as the tpb would say
That man is lucky he got away from her
I&#39;m not buying her story for a second.
I see those fake tears dried right up 😂
this is what happens when you do drugs
😂😂😂😂 SHE did it again.
She should NOT GET HIM BACK
Suspect&#39;s LOOKS are a felony.
This ain’t helping your cause
She is EVERYWHERE! Lock her up!
Pink Hair. explains everything
Do the judges ever see any of this?
One psychopath woman and 64 cops.
“Get on your belly!”<br><br>“Which one?!”
Absolutely unhinged!
&quot;Is this a learning experiance?&quot; 🤣
Right now you guys need a priest
Why dont they show the actual tazing?
You opted to Hold the highlight of the video hostage and interrupt it twice at a climatic point…. I opted to Stop watching. My first time in many years of watching youtube videos that I’ll be researching how to block a (your) channel. Congrats!
I love this no fks given attitude of the cops.<br><br>From where I am there is a female pampering culture.<br><br>A female cop must be present and only a female cop is allowed to arrest a female suspect.<br><br>And in most cases the female plays the gender card and a poor man gets in trouble although being innocent.<br><br>We need this cop system in my country.<br><br>Because we are fed up of this female blshit drama.
Hope the ex got custody of their kid.
People stay in California!
"Oh Karen, you&#39;re so entitled."
Imagine this being your sister..
Allegedly rammed two cruisers
lol &quot;is this a learning experience?&quot;
"La violence ne sert a rien, la police n&#39;a fait qu&#39;aggraver la situation..."
Why don&#39;t people just listen?
The only psycho here is this “mother”.
"Therapist,  that says it all!  🤷‍♂️"
Don&#39;t forget to send her the bill!
She&#39;s got Karen syndrome.
Dang. I feel bad for her son.
She&#39;s some kind of special! 😂
Keep her away from that poor child!
that female officer is Gold
Soo glad I dont live in america.
Make ASYLUMS Great Again!
Man I am so glad I didn’t have kids.
"Hi Dennis, how’s D and Charlie ?"

Omg she&#39;s exasperating 😳
"german polize <br>ask ,once"
Drama so fake its sickening.
Silly moo..not so tuff now😂
Must be some kind of bad drug
That is one sick woman.
I hope she doesn&#39;t have her kids.
The male cops a real one forreal
Take your Meds people!
Why give her so many chances!
That tazer needs new batteries.
Just lower the window!
These cops all so dramatic
how hard is it to cooperate
how did she escape the sow farm
A really sad situation  .
Weird that she’s not haitian
Only in America
The entitlement of some people
Probably should stay away
Ok im done people r crazy
That was so unnecessary 🙄
In short the &quot;Modern Wormn&quot;
The officer ran behind a car backing up thats not on the crasy lady
This girl IS PSYCHO
She is in the wrong 100%
Kings of escalation

The fact that they think they&#39;re being quiet during their pranks when there in the same room.
They need a therapist.

"I wanted to tell you that if you give me an iPhone 11 that my parents have not been able to buy me one, I ask you from Rhodia, please, I beg you"

STOP CAUSING DRAMA U ALL THEY ARE GOOD PEOPLE AND KIND AND SWEET
"u are really good at singing, but im much better at sarcasm"
The girl looks like she is in her 20s while my dude over here seems like he just hit 7
bruh we bullied this song to death back in the day 💀
2016: people came to listen the song<br>2020: people came to see the dislikes<br>same thing in 2021 i guess<br>oh- we’re already in 2022?
Why no one be talking about his weird ass sleeveless hoodie...
I’m so ashamed this is gonna be in my watch history
"No matter how bad you think this song is, life was fire when it dropped."
Third grade looks tough
”Sweatshirt&quot; By autotune featuring Jacob Sartorius
“No makeup with some sweatpants on.” <br>   <b>Girl is wearing overalls</b>
"As cringy as this song is, we all got fond memories of 2016 that we can’t forget"
Jacob don&#39;t listen to all the haters. Listen to me. I hate you
1 fucking million dislikes im so fucking happy
"Guys, stop making fun of this song, it saved my life! I was in a coma and the nurse turned on the radio and this song was on so I got up and turned it off"
You know what. Honestly. Respect to this dude for keeping this song up. I feel like most people would’ve taken it down
"Well, it&#39;s a no for me, Jacob."
"After keeping this song as my alarm at 6 am, I started waking up at 5:30 am"
Thanks to you Jacob the world has run out of bleach.
this a hood classic idc what yall say
She never wore his sweatshirt.
I didn’t know they had lockers in elementary school
<b>When he catches feelings for the teacher</b>
is it weird this makes me so nostalgic now and I miss this era badly 💀
Why does he look like he’s 10 and she’s like 17?
This really has 3 times more dislikes than likes. I’m dead
Even his clothes run away from him
Can&#39;t let gng know I fw this 💀
Let&#39;s get this comment to have more likes than the actual video!
Imagine being 15 and a 3rd grader gets accepted into your highscjool and forces you to put on his XXS swearshirt.
1000 likes and ill make this my ringtone...
Lowkey crazy nostalgia from 6th grade 😭 and a crazy amount of disappointment in me coming back to watch this
I’m surprised the teacher didn’t tell Jacob to put his hood down like cmon horrible teaching 0/10
my bleach killed itself before I could drink it. ..
why is a 1st grader hitten on a teacher.<br>what are these likes coming from
This is the greatest song ever made in the entire musical industry. I was going through so much but this song changed how my depression went. It only made me more depressed
I love the way she never actually put the sweatshirt on😂
"Who else came here just to read the comments, and not even watch the video?"
Me: Mom can we get kidz bop<br>Mom: no we got kidz bop at home<br>Kidz bop at home:
people were so mean about this song omg 😭
"Lyrics need some work, they&#39;re appalling mate. Good luck on your next song, not like it can be much worse."
<b>someone tell Willy Wonka that one of his Oompa Loompas escaped</b>
Who came at the end of 2019 to see how many likes and dislikes there are
Say what you want but Jacob has some hidden talent. KEEP IT HIDDEN 🔥🔥🔥
Even his clothes can&#39;t stand him....wow
I started dying when the sweatshirt started crawlin&#39; around then i went to go read the comments to laugh even harder and here&#39;s what I found:<br>-he must not wash that thing because there&#39;s enough bacteria for it to just get up and walk<br>-why does a sweatshirt dance better than him<br>-everybody&#39;s gangsta until he sweatshirt starts movin&#39;<br>I&#39;m crying lmaoo
Its so sad how i can no longer see the dislikes
we were crazy in 2016 this isn&#39;t thaaat bad
my mom walked in on and i changed to porn because it was easier to explain
My dad walked in and I switched to porn because it was easier to explain.
This made me go to Justin Bieber - Baby and undislike it.
It’s kinda fucked up how much cyber bullying this kid went through back then
Lol the ad I had before the video was a bleach ad... I wish I didn&#39;t skip it
This song is actually pretty good.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>If you mute it.
Lets make it to 2 million Dislikes
i’d do anything to go back to this time
that shirt has cleaned the floor more than the janitor&#39;s mop and he still had the audacity to give it to her
Jacob legit sounds like spongebob going through puberty
Who else came to dislike and look at the comments🙋🙋🙋
I would kill to go back to 2016 again
Who came to dislike?
Wait. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>That girl looks 17 in thia video and he looks like he is 9 in this video -_- at least get some accurate aged actors/actresses
"Well, time to clear my history"
Life was simple when this came out
"If this was age restricted, there wouldn&#39;t be any likes."
I only come back to this video to look at the comment section😂
"&quot;Chillin with her hair tie, no makeup with her sweatpants on&quot;<br><br>the girl: <b>not wearing a hairtie, has makeup on, and isnt wearing sweatpants</b>"
“I know I made a song about a sweatshirt but WHAT IS THIS” 💀💀 girl ick is the best song.
ive never been so proud of the dislike button
"Put this song as the new alarm sound of your house&#39;s security, and if someone tries to enter, they will run the fuck out"
"Is it just me, or is this very confusing y there’s a walking sweatshirt?🤔🤔🤔"
Used to hate this song now it gives me old good times nostalgic vibes 😭
if you use the code &#39;sartorious&#39; you get 60% off bleach
who else came to see the dislikes
"Guys stop the hate ok?! Jacob saved my life, I had a horrible car accident and was in a coma for a few months, the nurse in my hospital room turned the t.v on and Jacobs song was playing so i got up and turned it off."
LADY BONER G-G-GOOOOONEEE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣
Who watches this video just to check the dis-likes?
stick to lip syncing please.... thanks!
I just came here to read the comments and dislike this video
What even was this era 😭
So if in school u have a crush u just give her a sweatshirt and you dating her now?
He gets about 10 dislikes every minute.
This wasn’t even a bad song but certain infl*encers manipulated their fanbase into just randomly hating Jacob when he was a kid at the time
Guys stop hating on Jacob he saved my life I was in a coma and they were about to pull the cord until somebody started playing his song and I woke up right away to turn that shit off
jeez and I thought matty B was gay
"The best part of the song is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvxRsDpXPGo&amp;t=200"">3:20</a>"
Life was so much simpler in 2016. I wanna go back
Who&#39;s here to dislike the video
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE HAVE REACHED OUR GOAL 1 M DISLIKES!!! XD
"Her hair is not tied, she’s wearing makeup, she’s not wearing sweatpants...😂😂"
My controversial opinion is that this song isn&#39;t that terrible
This song fits well for my torture chair
Not gonna lie i came here to proudly look at the dislike button
314 thousand people missed the dislike button
As corny as the song was I find myself coming back to it just to remember how unique 2016 was 💀💀💀
Let&#39;s be honest most of us just came to see the comments and dislike 😂
I can smell the autotune here.
Who came here to see how many dislikes this has? 😂
real og trap music
Who came here just to look at the dislikes?
I hate my generation
For a limited time offer if you use the code Jacob saturious you will get 20% off bleach
"I swear to god, 2016 was hell of a year"
Play this at my funeral......so then I could wake Tf up and turn that shit off
With those ears he can fly away from haters
Song wasn’t even that bad
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvxRsDpXPGo&amp;t=67"">1:07</a> even his sweatshirt wants to run away"
I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying that but even Friday is better than this
Who came here to check the dislikes! I know you did it. don&#39;t lie.
"No Jacob, auto tune is NOT an instrument."
Naw this shit ass but nostalgic for sure
I hit the dislike button before I even watched the video
Who else disliked before they watched the video? 😂🙋🏼

JACOB YOU SAVED MY LIFE... Someone tried to rob me so I turned on your song and he ran away.
"born to say wtf is this, raised to admit its nostagic asf"
"Guys stop the hate. I mean the song gets pretty lit at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvxRsDpXPGo&amp;t=191"">3:11</a><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I know... I&#39;m not funny 😂😂😂but I try !!!"

I miss when this was the most controversial thing people talked about online
"Muted the video, just came to see dislikes and read comments"
GUYS WE MADE IT 1 MILLION HOW ABOUT 2 MILLION DISLIKES
If I were that girl I would be terrified
this kid makes Rebecca black look like a musical genius
<b>Millie Bobby brown has left the chat</b>
I remember blasting this song in radio games just to annoy people back then😭
Who came here just to check the dislikes on this video?
Thanks for this song! It saved my life! I was lying on my deathbed and I woke up to this song to turn the shit off!
hey Jacob don&#39;t listen to the hater. I make homemade smoothies at home and I was wondering if you could try my new recipe I am only 13 so I am not sure how good it will be. Ingredients:<br><br><br><br><br>Bleach
"ah yes, 2016. the era when making fun and mocking actual children was… normal for some reason. looks like a lot of you in the comments haven’t quite yet grown out of that huh. it’s been seven years i’m not sure why this child who is a legal adult by now is still living rent free in your mind"
"500,000 DISLIKES YES LETS HIT ONE MILLION"
Jacob: &quot;no makeup with some sweatpants on&quot;<br><br>The girl: <b>heavy makeup</b>

"477,945 People missed the damn dislike button"
"Wow people are terrible. This is literally a kid….and for a kid it’s really freaking good. He has a whiny tone of voice BECAUSE he is a kid, but his singing is even and consistent. Everyone hopping on the hate train should be ashamed of themselves"
the only good thing about this video is the like to dislike ratio 😂
Even his Sweatshirt hates him
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvxRsDpXPGo&amp;t=190"">3:10</a>, best part of the video!!!"
"I don’t care what anybody says, this deserves to go in the Gen Z Hall of Fame."

Imagine If Jacob Sartorius came on &quot;America&#39;s got talent.&quot; I can just see Simon&#39;s reaction.
I thought baby by Justin Bieber was bad until I saw this
If this were a try not cringe challenge everyone would fail.
We did it!<br>1 mil dislikes <br>And thanks bleach for helping me there
IF YOU THOUGHT  THIS WAS A GOOD SONG YOU FORGOT TO TURN THE VOLUME ON
his sweatshirt is fucking haunted why is it busting a move
I was watching this with my mum and she thought Jacob was gay
Who&#39;s here to dislike the video
Is it me or does he sound like a dying goat trying to pronounce words
Pfft i used to vibe to this when i was 12-13 🧍🏻‍♀️ (im about the same age as him.)
My bleach drank itself before i could drink it
it&#39;s actually not that bad if you just mute the volume :)
Who just came here to dislike this video?
no bc this song wasn’t even that terrible why did it make the internet explode 😭
This song is the reason aliens don&#39;t want to visit Earth
This is torture. .. Please... make it stop
Literally the FIRST fucking time I saw 1 million dislikes I&#39;m so proud of you haters 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"These lyrics go so deep, lets keep them berried."
&quot;I don&#39;t want you to be cold&quot;<br><b>wears sleeveless sweater</b>

Shut up haters Jacobs my hero.  I was in a coma and this song came on and I woke up to turn it off
The song was cute actually.  We  were crazy bullies w no personality
Remember that time when you ACTUALLY had to have talent to be successful?
WE DID IT GUYS WE HIT 1 MIL DISLIKES
<i>Ok but the satanic sweatshirt can dance better than him tho</i>.
Looking back it ain’t that bad bro Lmfaooo wtf 😭😭y’all was just bagging on him 😂
"Roses are red, Violets are blue,<br><b>I came to see the dislikes, so did you.</b>"
who came here only to see the dislikes 😂
pausing the video to grab my bleach
It was never that bad of a song for what it was and his age. It&#39;s got a target audience and it does a good job at appealing to that target audience.
Who else got stage 5 terminal brain cancer from this
"YES WE DID IT GUYS WE GOT THE VIDEO TO 1,000,000 DISLIKES LETS GO!!!!"
I had a bad day and decided to punish my ear drums 😂😂
is that OLIVE !!?? 😭😭😭😭
Who else came to see the dislikes and the comments?
Just came here to dislike this
The only Guy I like is THE black Guy cause he&#39;s Trying to Bully Jacob
Bro this is considered old and nostalgic now ☠️☠️☠️
His sweatshirt tryna kill everyone in that school<br>Edit: THE SWEATSHIRT STARTED TO BRAKE DANCE OMFG
Legit the only reason why I clicked on this video was to see if YouTube rewind 2018 had more dislikes 😂
one sip a day keeps the jacob away
"Even though it’s been 7 years, I still fucking hate it"
Why are all of you guys hating on Jacob?  He saved my life.  I was in a coma and the nurse put this song on so I woke up and ran to turn it off.
"Song gets really good at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvxRsDpXPGo&amp;t=191"">3:11</a>"
Who came here for the dislikes and scrolled down to the comments to see the hate?
And bro says layzbanks songs are bad. 💀
Who clicked on the dislike button before actually watching it? 😳👎
who came here just to dislike... i know u did :D
I prefer Justin Bieber.
"People really be hating on such an innocent song, it’s just sad how doomed this generation is."
Did anyone dislike the video before watching? I know I&#39;m not the only one
Who is also only here to look how many dislikes the video have
he&#39;s still terrible even with auto tune
"To be honest, during the day people hated and roasted this guy cuz of this mv, i dont think this song was that bad tbh. I actually liked it"
Guys stop hating this song is actually great...<br><br><br><br><br>When you put it on mute.

Funny how all the likes and positive comments are just 13 year old girls...

Why is everybody hatin&#39; on Jacob? He saved my life! I was in a coma and the nurse put this song up. I woke up and ran to turn it off.
"My grandpa was dead but when I blared this on full volume, it brought him back from the dead and he threw my computer out of the window."
Here after that TikTok video he made
Just Imagine if this song got age-restricted
At first I thought this was trash but if you listen closely it&#39;s actually garbage

All these years later the fact that this is a real music video blows my mind
Jacob is the type of kid to get bullied at Home School
Bart baker squad?
Why is this not as bad as I remember it being
I switched to porn when mom  came in because it&#39;s easier to explain
Even the sweatshirt itself ran away from his crusty ass 😂
My bleach died before I could drink it.
Shits a banger
DRINKKKKKK MEEEEEE
"this song saved my life. <br>i was in the hospital with a coma for six months when the nurse walked in and turned the radio on. this song started playing. i got up, and turned the radio off."

8 yrs ago and still sounds horrible 😂
back when seventh graders looked cool
"This song is still garbage, but now I think it’s nostalgic. Ewww…. What’s happened to me?"
Just a reminder that this man pulled BOTH Jenna Ortega AND Millie Bobby Brown
"brodie snapped onnat 2nd verse, <br>“when you WALK the halls lil girl, you know you wanna flaunt it” 🔥🔥💪🏻😈🤧"
How did bro even try to compare this to ick...
This song is so tuff
this is why the dislikes arent visible anymore
"Don&#39;t know why I randomely remembered this obomination, but it is nostalgic either way"
Let&#39;s be honest your voice was really good and the beat was cool but what the fu*** Men. Is that girl even wanna wear your sweat shirt Next time think twice before you release a bit it&#39;s not about the song but also to entertain the people
aye i won’t lie this ain’t even that bad looking back at it
Why would any girl want to wear a sweatshirt that&#39;s been dragged through through school Halls 🤦🏻
This is the most 2016 video I ve ever seen

This song hold so much noslitgica
"Look I’m sorry but I feel like this song hits the sped people who have a thing for ear worms, and it’s okay for me to say that bc I was and am a sped kid/ adult lmao"
jacob should feel ashame of himself  for releasing this peice of crap
Nostalgiaaa. Randomly thought about this song.. it’s actually good 🤣
"I’m gonna be honest, Jacob was about 13 (??) when he made this, the amount of hate he probably got is kinda sad. Yes this is the internet and yes the song isn’t the best, but it’s not the worst either. All I’m saying is, being like 13-14 and getting all this hate must be kinda harsh, maybe just some common criticism instead? Idk maybe I’m just soft but I know how I’d feel if I got this must shit at 13 😭"
Blud be talking bout The ick song and This what he made- Should be ashamed what so ever bruh
Why am I nostalgic from this ☠️
"Look I’m sorry but I feel like this song hits the sped people who have a thing for ear worms, and it’s okay for me to say that bc I was and am a sped kid/ adult lmao"

I know he was just 13 but this song is horrible
I remember hating on this so hard when I was 11. The hook is actually good. I feel bad we all collectively bullied a 13 year old for making musicallys and songs. 2016-2019 was peak
This song makes me realize how talented Justin Bieber is.
anyone else come on here just for memories 👀
That’s actually wild
Omg it&#39;s even worse than I remember
THIS IS FIRE🔥🔥🔥SOMEONE PUT IT OUT🗑️🗑️🗑️

THESE COMMENTS ARE GOLDD but ngl this is so catchy
"damn, the like to dislike ratio is crazy"
"There’s no way that his sweat shirt fits her, my guy is built like a seven year-ols"
Why do i lowkey like it
The singing is bum cheeks but the lyrics are kinda catchy
"As someone who wants to study medicine and become a surgeon or a generally helpful paramedic, I didn&#39;t know the migraine I achieved after watching this video was possible, after this, I refused to open my eyes and covered my ears for 4 straight minutes to meditate how big of a nose dive my mental gave after processing 2 minutes of the most painful audio-visual experience of my life, also if you are gonna make a video about a sweatshirt and wanting a girl to wear it to remember you, make her wear it, because if not it makes the song pointless."
why was no one freaked the fuck out theres a crawling sweatshirt what is this saw trap
I need help 💀
This is girl is in Manifest
CHILLIN WIDDA HAIR TIE 🔥🔥💪🔥

The classic of days of the internet absolutely shitting on this song
Now that im not an edgy 13 year old this kind of a banger.
That’s the daughter in manifest
"This isn&#39;t a bad song at all, let&#39;s be honest, we all just hated it back in 2016 because some influencer told us to. I&#39;m ashamed to say that I was one of those people who made jokes about drinking bleach because of this song and all that, but I&#39;m glad to see he has made success early on in his life, and is continuing to be successful today."

"Okay, it&#39;s bad, but it&#39;s not <b>THAT</b> bad. I actually liked it when I was younger. And it&#39;s still kind of catchy. But not as good as it used to be, especially considering that I&#39;m now older than he was in this."
"I solved necromancy because of this song, if you turn it on in a graveyard the dead will rise to see who&#39;s the fastest to turn it off"
we all knew where we were don&#39;t lie
Any other 16 year old LeafyisHere fans when this was released? This is almost nostalgic. I feel kinda bad for mocking this kid.
This shi went platinum on musically 😂😂
I can still recite the intro lyrics - this meme came to mind last night 💀💀
Started off like Dream’s song and both are absolute garbage. What a coincidence.

2016: The Year I Graduated from High School. The thing is that this was Uploaded 3 Days after I walked Across that Stage. I remember this Day as well since I did something Fun During the 1st 3 Days as a High School Graduate.

"This has got to be the most accurate example of a bad song with a catchy beat. I mean, seriously, it sounds like a parody but isn&#39;t."
"Aw yeah, That&#39;s hot<br><br>-Plainrock124"
This goes hard I just don’t think the voice fits. Never understood the hate
IS THAT OLIVE FROM MANIFEST???
bro why do I know even the fucking opening skit by memory
the beauty and simplicity of this masterpiece of a song captivates me into a better person. I believe this song saved my life and gave me strength to overcome anything
I&#39;m sorry for what I said about you
MATTY B DUPE
"Children in Shanghai, you want job that is so so fun?"
"Jacob, I’m sorry. We all did really cringy shit when were 13, but if 59 million people read my shitty fanfic, I’d regret everything 10 years later."
Weezer
"there’s something weirdly nostalgic about this song now even with how shit it is lmao, i got reminded of its existence from someone’s story on instagram and i’m shocked to see people still have recent comments on here"
Bro took over the internet at one point 😂

Real music
This song is fire
💀😭🙏
tHIS SHIT FIRE.... on mute
"Hi, i remember being very young and hearing sweatshirt and everyone was making fun of it. I am 16 now and I randomly remembered the song and revisited it and I am alarmed by the hate comments. My little nine year old brother makes youtube videos and he has amassed a decent amount of subscribers and he receives hate comments often, and when I first saw these it made me very angry and I couldnt believe people would speak poorly of innocent kids posting content. I think he has given me a unique perspective and seeing you recently make a couple songs that I just watched that are pretty good makes me happy. You fought through whatever negative shit came at you and you kept going with your dream. All the hate comments on this video… people should feel ashamed, jesus."
Who’s here in 2023 😭
nah this fall off was crazy man
Jacob the goat stop playing
Please forgive me
This has not aged well at all....
It’s not even that bad tbh

"Jacob I’m really upset you decided to go with the crowd and hate on your own song too, it’s not cringey . I listen to it everyday making food in the kitchen and I’m 19 years old 😂 there’s people out there who love you!! And God loves you, I know you’ve been struggling and went through a lot and I know that’s so hard emotionally and mentally but I’m so glad you’re doing great and recovering, just please own it!! For yourself, and for everyone who supports you."

Is that guy Jacob sartorius?
Bro has negative x negative RIZZ
"i mean it&#39;s decent, i don&#39;t know why this is so hated since 2016"
Wow thank you so much for making my ears bleed 😊

Someone please tell me this is a joke or a parody....
That sweatshirt just mopped half the school…

Anyone from 50 ways to break a laptop?

"When music has gone so downhill, that this song (that used to be known for being literally terrible, and yes this song is still bad) starts to not sound as bad in comparison to some of the recent stuff 😭"
The instrumental is actually fire I just wish pretty much anyone else was singing over it
2024😭
FIRE 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 SOMEONE PUT IT OUT
Sometimes I randomly sing this. Damn you Jacob.
"They literally deleted many bleach related comments! Guy I remember my comment had 5k likes few years ago and it grew each time I looked same with other bleach comments. Man thats whack😂 been searching for hours and reached the bottom, seems like Jacob hates bleach jokes"
I’m gonna go listen to ick
This has enlightened me to write music this song is so good and melodic not cringe 10/10 recommend i played this at my dads funeral and he got up and said wtf is this this is gas asf and he got up and b slapped tf out of my aunt and proceeded to run spinning his shirt signifying his male dominance overall i give this song a good 10/10 should play this every morning at the announcements to spread awareness
"if i could kill this song I would, Rucka Rucka Ali&#39;s parody is so much better"
I still can’t believe he still looks the same at 20

"I&#39;m not saying this is an amazing song or anything, but I have definitely heard worse songs that don&#39;t get as much hate"
this still goes hard🔥
"Damn, relationship lasted a week, world record for second grade!"

Im only here coz Im going through a little memory trip and I truly miss 2016. It was such a good year and I had a overall great summer
i used dislike tube and the video currently has 2.3 million dislikes
This MF go HARRD AF On G

Revisiting this year&#39;s later- this is terrifying
me personally my video cant have more dislikes than likes. like my nigga ratio
i just found this from a most disliked song list I&#39;m help I&#39;m screaming and crying and sobbing
I said things at a time it wasn&#39;t right
Dayumm this is ass 🔥
2.3M dislikes...<br><br>Harsh but maybe it was just the reference to someone else wearing his sweatshirt 🤔 😳 😅
☺☺
Unpopular opinion: this song is better than hit or miss
Damn 7 years ago.. Life was peak
I want to make things better
this is even funnier now that i&#39;m older and i know the love interest is the lesbian girl off Fresh Off the Boat
i love this musical masterpiece
How tf did he pull millie
"I can&#39;t lie definitely his worst song, but not too too bad honestly."
"While we were all hating on this song in 2016, now it’s just a nostalgic childhood memory 😭"
It’s cringe but funny and low key impressive. I like it😂
I really thought he was going to be the next Justin Bieber

"thank you for helping me find my 13th reason, I rlly appreciate it, and now I know I really don’t have anything to live for, you know I was having a really bad day until I found this"
my litter sister was on a wheelchair and I turned this fire song on she finally got up and turned it off what a great moment!! 🤩🤩
OH NO MOMS HOME
Cringe
the beat is actually good it’s only the vocals that ruined it
The song is not bad and I think the child has potential in the music but the lirycs are weird beacause he was too young to talk about those things.
"PS: A 14 year old was a besotted fella at school, and I started crushing since I was a kid."
"And it is like enduring a sonic torture chamber, where every note is a dagger to your eardrums, and every lyric is a slap in the face of good taste"
this song is absolutely the worst song in the world. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I don&#39;t know bout you<br>But I&#39;ll take the love songs<br>And give you the future in exchange.
I only came here for the “3rd grade looks hard” comment &amp; I can’t find it 😂
Omg &quot;and you can tell your friends well together till the end&quot; OMG NO BC I RELATE TO THOSE LYRICS HIT DIFFERENT 🤭😔
"As much hate as this song gets, I know almost all of us can remember the days when we were younger in school when all the girls would love this song and all the boys would hate it with a passion. Then we would all go home to watch vine or youtube in it’s prime 2016 era and life was good. So for those memories, I enjoy this song."
what ger?? 🤨🤨
Y’know… it’s not the best song but it’s not like I could do any better. I’ve attempted making songs and it’s really hard. 💀

Imagine in 2023 THIS is still your greatest accomplishment
"I&#39;M SORRY, BUT THIS WAS 7 YEARS AGO? THE ABSOLUTE BANGER IS 7 YEARS OLD?  7?"
I like 😊
NAUR I used to watch this back in 6th grade in 2018 to read the comments and laugh along. Its the absolute peak of cringe but life was better back in the days when we could see the dislikes and we all laughed at him in the comment section
"I remember this like it was yesterday, I learned all the lyrics to this trash song just so the girls in my 6th grade tech ed class thought I was funny, crazy thinking the stuff you do as a kid, still play this banger at work btw, it’s trash. But a banger."
When dislikes ain&#39;t mean a thing anymore this be the result
I love how throughout this whole music video she doesn&#39;t once actually wear his sweatshirt.
This is first song l ever listening Jacob Sartorius it&#39;s his B-Day today so Happy  Birthday to him!!!!!🥳🎉🎂 09/02/23

School     ❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍😍
Sweatshirt wtf is that
blasting this on 1.75%
I feel like there’s a very specific word/name blocked in the comment section.
To apologize to everyone and no one at the same time is a talent she definitely has.
"This is the most non-apology apology video I have ever seen. Don’t bother saying you’re sorry when you can’t even say directly what you’re sorry for, let alone name anybody who you are apologising TO. <br><br>Stop telling people to admit their ✨sins✨ when you don’t even admit your own."
I got my lick back really 🙄. Folks this is want happens when you misuse AAVE.
"This is not an apology. This is performative and self aggrandisement. Apologise to the individuals you wronged, you called one of them a talentless loser a few weeks ago, that&#39;s who you really are, and not everyone buys this rebrand. Do better."
the fact ur filtering out comments about JS says enough about how genuine this apology is
adopting a pinterest jesus girly aesthetic doesn’t erase the emotional abuse and harassment you publicly carried out against other creators. this is embarrassing.
"You forgot the most important apology, JS. I find it ironic that you show a clip from a video where you’re sitting in her apartment.  Ya know the one that she let you move into, because she was your best friend at the time… so holy art thou"
"This is not how a grown adult apologizes.  What are you sorry for? Who are you saying sorry to? What behaviors are referring to? This is performative, insincere and just as vague as any other ‘apology’ she’s ever offered anyone."
Its horrifying how easy it is for terrible people to absolve themselves by wrapping their wrongdoings in a pseudo-christian cover.
you know exactly who deserves an apology. this is such bull
This means a lot less knowing you called Rachel a loser not that long ago. You’re still mean. You still only think about yourself.
"Thank you Gabbie, i&#39;m happy to see you in a better place now &lt;3"
"Until you personally and privately reach out to RO and apologize, this will ring pretty hollow. Repentance is followed by a change in behavior, and by continuing to insist that you have nothing to say to RO, you are showing that you are the same exact person as you were four/five years ago. And I’m saying this as a Christian, like an actual Bible-reading follower of Christ. As your sister in Christ, I would really advise you to reach out to RO in a compassionate and humble way."
Women have to dress modestly? Turning to faith washes away your &quot;sins&quot;? Not believing in this bs makes you a NPC? Keep it.
"Well this was s**t. I don’t see growth, I only see using of religion as ur mullet to forgive urself and not actually work on ur mistakes and truly apologize to the people you hurt. This is y I keep not liking religion, it just allows for this continuous toxic behaviour. Jesus is looking down at u and being like 🤦🏻‍♀️"
JS.
"You constantly laughing while giving those “apologies” shows that you don’t mean it. At all. You can’t, that’s part of your problem. And the person you owe one the most is definitely J.S. It’s a shame that you aren’t able to get it."
"J.S., Rachel Oates, Trisha, Daniel, Oscarwylde, Angelika Oles, Dom DeAngelis....."
I think this is actually worse than if she had a ukulele
"You need to reflect more.... No amount of giggling and love for god will make us forget who you truly owe an apology to. You honestly haven&#39;t changed much, just packaging yourself differently."
"Apologise to the woman you tried to ruin while she was pregnant, Gabrielle."
"As someone who was a fan for a long time, this is lame as hell. &quot;I think there are people I need to apologize to.&quot; So I filmed a video and posted it instead of actually apologizing to the people."
"weren’t you just calling rachel a loser again like 10 minutes ago? what an abrupt heel turn.<br><br>Spiritual bypass: “a tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks.”"
You are not using “got my lick back” in the right way….
"This video was the equivalent to saying &quot;Dang, I&#39;m sorry guys.&quot; In a group chat then slamming your laptop closed and ignoring everyone further."
The least sincere apology I&#39;ve ever seen.
babe i think you need to stop saying get your lick back cause that’s absolutely not how it’s meant to be used 😂
what about jesse???
Real apologies aren&#39;t monetized
Its giving my pastor told me I had to make ammends to make it into heaven so here I am doing the bare minimum.
why is there so much laughing in something that is supposed to be serious??
&quot;god taught me empathy&quot; girl that was supposed to be there from the beginning lol
Yeah no I don’t like this at all. There were some good apologies to some people but jeez the people you really went after did not get the care and time they deserved with this. The pivot to religion makes me uncomfortable and it’s weird to bring that in when are apologizing to people you self admittedly traumatized. The apologies to your fans is good and probably will help them and obviously Joey accepted your apology but the amount of energy you put into tearing some of those people down is exponentially larger than the effort and time you put into the apology. <br><br>In general this feels weird. Like why are you apologizing to your family on YouTube? Do we need to hear it too? I understand the fans and maybe some former coworkers but it was weirdly personal and impersonal at the same time. Admitting you’re wrong is hard and I understand it’s probably easiest to put it all out at once but I’m just a little confused about the goal of this video as a whole? Is it for the people you’re apologizing to or for you?
"Tell me why you ranted ONCE AGAIN about R.O in your oxford interview after you apparently «reformed yourself». She’s one of the people you owe an apology to the most, but you’ll never let yourself make one to her, because you have just as little self awareness as you did before ypur long break. You’re the same as you used to be, but just wants us to THINK you’ve genuienly changed."
"&quot;sorry to anybody I hurt&quot; is such a worthless blanket apology. Then again, I&#39;m sure this wasn&#39;t posted to be genuine, it was a desperate attempt to get her abysmal view rate back up... and I guess it worked because I watched it."
"A very rough watch. You are apologizing to “everyone”? Everyone but the people who you fell out of favor with. That pride and ego are definitely still rockin. My partner and I used to like some of your music and we were looking forward to the come back, but this made it 100% worse for the few who liked you and wanted to see a change."
"That verse in James says admit your sins TO EACH OTHER. You didn&#39;t apologize personally to anyone, just in public.<br><br>Matthew 6:1 Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven."
She won&#39;t apologise to J S and R O because I guarantee she still doesn&#39;t think she did anything wrong in those situations.
"This is pathetic and insulting to your actual victims, Gabbie. You disgust me."
"God doesnt want a YT apology video, you should make it right personally. This apology is so... Vague a d insensitive. The thinky veilied God aspect to it all is just weird"
how embarrassing.
"If ur gonna apologize, try to not laugh while you do it. That’s a free tip without needing to pay management"
"J3$$ie $mil3$ more than deserves an apology. An entire video longer than this. SO many people deserve specific apologies, but her more than anyone. <br><br>I used to see myself in you Gabbie. I used to love your content. In 2019 you were my most listened to artist on Spotify. I read your poetry. I looked up to you. <br><br>The fact that you can&#39;t see that the most vile thing you ever did you did to your &quot;best friend&quot;.  The fact that you can&#39;t say her name to apologize, it&#39;s heartbreaking. <br><br>Filtering her name out of the comments is disgusting behavior. Stop hiding behind religion. <br><br>Using Jesus&#39; name in vain isn&#39;t just saying &quot;oh my God.&quot; It&#39;s also using your religion as a shield, using your humanity and sin nature as an excuse. I hope you are actually sorry and, if you are, you&#39;ll apologize publicly the way you destroyed her life publicly."
"You know who deserves an apology but you&#39;re not big enough to do so. Grow up. You were wrong. Take responsibility. You are way too old to be acting like this, it&#39;s so gross."
Girl you&#39;re missing personal apologies to a LOT of people. You know who you should have started with...
This feels EXTREMELY self serving. Like you&#39;re trying to absolve yourself but you&#39;re not really directly naming the situations or directly speaking to those who are owed the apology. Did you reach out to those people directly as well? Also this is monetized lol
"Not saying any names is not an apology nor holding yourself accountable, all it’s doing is boosting yourself.  “Look how great of a person Gabbie is” you want to say you’re this religious “have all the answers” person, when you’re still serving your own ego with this video and you refuse to see that"
Apologize to J Sm i les
"worst apology video ever. once again, gabbie hanna fails the internet 🙄"
"God cant forgive you on other people&#39;s behalf and this apology rings hollow when you have certain names blocked in the comments. It would have been insanely impressive if you could have come on here and apologized to her. Also, saying that any non-Christian is an NPC is insanely insulting."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svKhRBAkqY&amp;t=620"">10:20</a> the sudden jump, the non authenticity, you&#39;re disassociating and trying very hard to cope ... lunatic and creepy"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svKhRBAkqY&amp;t=852"">14:12</a> „and we know when people choose to not serve you that horrible things happen“ - saying that while referring to 9/11 is beyond disgusting"
So because I don’t believe in God I’m an NPC…riiiiight…
Jesse Smiles
What a non-apology. This is so nasty and the way you’re laughing through it all says so much. Gross
"This apology is BS, your acting is terrible. Everyone knows you are just going to pull the same stunts all over again when you want to release more music. You are not forgiven."
apologize to JS
"Born again Christianity can be extremely dangerous for those who  got into it from &quot;fixing&quot; themselves just by accepting christ as your savior. <br><br>This is absolutely a phase, and will pass within a few years. It&#39;s one thing to work on your relationship with God, however to boast on what a humble/apologetic person you are now because of it is not it. <br><br>Mental health and the pathways that our brains hold cannot be undone with religion. It takes actual work, and a lot of therapy from a professional. <br><br>Being born again does <b>not</b> give you a clean slate, and your emotional maturity is clearly still lacking. Do better. That doesn&#39;t mean giggling off a list of things you did in the past. You still have a lot of growing to do, and I hope your younger fans understand that."
"When an &quot;&quot;&quot;apology&quot;&quot;&quot; video starts with the youtuber not cutting off the part when they turn on the camera, you just know it&#39;s gonna be <b>gold</b>"
"Nah. Genuine apologies are specific, both in what you did wrong and the individual people they&#39;re meant for. This ain&#39;t it. Also I don&#39;t think you&#39;re using &quot;I got my lick back&quot; correctly."
APOLOGIZE TO EVERYONE PROPERLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
"Wow, being almost 40 and still having the reasoning of a 14 year old."
"This isn&#39;t genuine. This is one of those apologizes to make yourself feel better. There are people who deserve an apology by name and by event. This isn&#39;t accepted by the people you&#39;ve hurt<br><br>Also ms. Oatmeal made a video you guys should check it out because she deserves one specifically because gabbie continues to insult her, even after she&#39;s been back."
"Not this woman &quot;apologizing&quot; for stealing people&#39;s labor then immediately stealing AAVE and using it SOOOOOO wrong. <br><br>PLEASE for the love of God (yk, the one you allegedly found) learn wtf &quot;get my lick back&quot; actually means.....or don&#39;t, and just never say it again! that would actually be preferable."
That prayer at the end….was really something 😅
Why is this apology video monetized ?
“I’ve reflected and want to apologize” <b>*spends the entire video not apologizing or taking proper accountability*</b>
"Nope, this is not it"
"In about six months your will start again your manic-bullying-harrassment acts online and will once again try to tear down the people you didn&#39;t apologized to (BUT SHOULD) and some new ones i&#39;m sure. You&#39;ll never change, Gabrielle."
This is actually so pathetic
You might as well grab the ukulele if you&#39;re going to be this insincere jfc...
"Honestly i wanted to believe that you were better and that you’ve changed. But seeing the way you spoke about R in that college setting, told me everything i need to know. You don’t mean these apologies. I really had faith in you. But it seems you haven’t changed and i’m not sure that you ever will."
JS
Gabbie coming back more unhinged than when she left was not on my bingo card
“I got my lick back” doesn’t mean what you think it means… you’re using it in the wrong context lol
"The apology that never was, what a patronising self unawareness pile of absolute crap."
"Takes a very, shall we say, interesting mind to interpret James 5:16 as &quot;Record a video apologizing to nobody in particular in the most generic of terms humanly possible, while also adding snide &#39;sorry you feel that way&#39;s for good measure.&quot; Nor do I think it meant absolving yourself of all responsibility simply by claiming you &quot;forgive everyone&quot; and with mealy-mouthed, half-hearted &quot;sorry&quot;s into the void.<br><br>Anyway, as always, Gabbie Hanna makes a video about her favourite (and only) topic: herself.  Later on in the video she says she used to be self-centered, vain and prideful, making meaningless content - which is exactly what this is.  Working &quot;like a robot: work, pay attention to me, get money&quot; - this is exactly what is still going on.<br><br>If (deliberate and/or outward) lack of self-awareness was a religion, Gabbie&#39;d be one of the patron saints."
"Rachel deserves an entire apology video to herself. The absolute VITRIOL you showed toward her was abhorrent. You were cruel on a deeply personal level. She was objective and honest. It&#39;s clear who was in the wrong there. There is treatment for narcissism, Gabbie, and being a narcissist doesn&#39;t have to make you a bad person, but it will if you don&#39;t actively work on it and you allow it to make you project all of your own faults and wrongdoings onto everyone else."
This is such a none apology. Apologise to Rachel Oats properly.
Gabbie God is way more forgiving and accepting than you can even fathom. The God you speak of sounds judgmental and condescending and sounds less like a vision of the Lord and more like a reflection of yourself.<br><br>your faith will always be lacking bc you project so much of yourself on a pedestal to worship instead of truly listening to His words and teachings of compassion and selfless care. <br><br>step outside yourself and become a member of Christ that He can be proud of
I worry that Gabbie believes she has found herself when in reality she has lost herself. Not sure if it’s some kind of trauma response or what. But all the overly religious content and intense worship of god and jesus feels forced and makes me uncomfortable. The prayer at the end was a lot… I’ve lost myself in religion as a young adult so I get it. I really am rooting for her. I’ve been a viewer for a decade and hope she can find herself and that she’s truly happy ❤️
Who else was here and watched the WHOLE damn video waiting to see if she would ever be a truly better person and apologize to J.S directly. Sad that this was such a waste of words and 0 accountability
"Using God’s name in vain is when someone calls themselves a Christian, but does not live like Christ. The people who go to church every Sunday and call themselves good people and boast about being devout Christians, but show through their actions that they actually aren’t good people, are the kinds of people who live their life in vain of God. They would use Christianity for their own personal gain materialistically and socially instead of personally or spiritually. They forget that religion and spirituality is a deeply personal journey and not a social or status symbol. A person who lives their life in the way of Christ does not judge or impose their beliefs onto others (yes, Jesus traveled and spread his message, but he did not force anyone to believe in him and his words, and he did not judge them for their beliefs or circumstances), is selfless and kind, has respect and love for all living beings, speaks the truth (not harshly, but in a kind, gentle way and without fear when you’re the only one who speaks up), is patient (slow to anger) and forgiving, and has humility— being able to put others before yourself and recognizing that you’re no more important than the person beside you. <br><br>We don’t need to see an apology video, we need to see a change in your behavior."
Where is her ukulele?
"Much like most religious people, doesn&#39;t take responsibility"
hey have you been tested for sociopathy? idk just wondering
Parading around your new affiliation w Christianity doesn&#39;t absolve u of anything btw.
"This a great start, but it&#39;s easy to apologise to people in clumps by saying, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to everyone who...&quot;<br><br>I just hope you personally reached out to the people who truly deserved an apology from you off camera."
Apologize without apologizing
9/11 prayer was crazy
"When God taught you empathy, did he show you how terribly you treated Yessi Miles and Pachel Yoates?"
"Unless you’ve started to try and personally reach out to everyone these broad apologies apply to, this is not a real apology."
"Gabbie, please try to build a life outside of the internet. I think you are your own worst enemy. You can change things for the better if you can stop being addicted to public opinion. Most of us just come onto these apps for fun/a break from reality. These apps ARE your reality. You’re still so young and I hope things will get better"
"The whole video i waited for her to say &quot;LOL, non really&quot;. And then she just prayed.<br>That&#39;s what i call talent: Apologise to everybody and insult people in the process."
Apologize to Jessica urban
Girl this isn’t how God designed apologies
It’s giving “I just met a church boy” this is the new me
Oh my god this is awful
It gives BPD
her saying “if i forgot someone…*looks up with her hands in prayer* i’m sorry” tells me EVERYTHING i need to know
"This apology is about as genuine to a certain U tuber (who’s name is clearly blocked) as Jaclyn Hill’s apology to Kalyn Nichols for stealing and destroying her career! But, go off……."
Gabbie is in her christian cult era
Too little too late
"She knows that turning to religion will shield her from responsibility. Its great that you are apologizing and I do think that should be recognized.. but the apology did not go into detail . Its not a full apology. Yet, since you are ‘turning to God’ now, you have all of these religious NPCs who will praise you and dismiss your horrible past just because you mention God. It doesnt come across as genuine. Im sure there is some real remorse and reflection there. But you have a LONG way to go. I hope you take more steps to make things right instead of absolving your ‘sins’ with religious bs."
Here we go with the born again Christian crap trope.
What?!?!? No ukulele??????? 😂
I spoke to Jesus personally and he said you are not forgiven because you&#39;re a phoney.
Gabbie the type that believes trùmp when he says they are eating cats and dogs in ohio
They could NEVER make me like you ❤
"Honey, I can forgive your past mistakes but I personally take offense at the way you choose to correlate a lack of religious practice or just the fact that not everyone is a Christian with tragedies.<br>The reason why tragedies like the holocaust, 9/11 and 10/7 happened and so on all happened because of fascists. It’s not an act of god but the men who committed these atrocities have done what they did in the name of god.<br>And when Christians are actually suffering and facing persecution, whose fault is it if not of their tormentors who are inflicting harm on christians because they’re christians?<br>Gabbie, I love you very much. Despite all that you regret, and despite all i disagree with you on, you’re still someone I will always look up to.<br>Which is why I think you’re taking it too far and your faith just seems like fanaticism at this point. Religion is not everything no matter how much you believe in it."
"See I love the growth, but the constant &quot;God here, Jesus that&quot; and saying that &quot;I was an NPC before Jesus&quot;. I&#39;m a fully functioning human being without any faith, and I&#39;m very glad that you, Gabbie, found faith and love that you needed in your life. But please also respect that there is a lot of people that aren&#39;t religious. I loved seeing the transformation you&#39;ve been going through, but IN THE WAY things were said it feels like a Jab and really disrespectful towards people that don&#39;t believe in the same thing. <br><br>I guess this is where I will take my leave. I&#39;ve loved supporting you and I know you&#39;re going to do fantastic things, but I dont feel like getting disrespected or feeling like someone makes me feel less than I am."
"You owe very specific people very specific apologies. This “apology” video is incredibly self gratifying and not about apologizing to people you hurt, but about making yourself feel better. Christians are specifically called to seek out reconciliation and forgiveness. This is not that. Hoping you extended real and personal apologies to the people you hurt behind the scenes."
You joined a cult? You went from one extreme to another. Also apologozing bc karma finally got you is embarassing.
TALKING TO GOD ABOUT 9/11!?!??!
"I mean this with all kindness. I’m happy you’re growing and acknowledging the hurt you’ve caused, but I really hope you take a moment of stillness to ask yourself why you made this video. I do hope that you’ve actually apologized to these people one on one. Additionally, if you are genuinely dealing with guilt, the best apology is changed behavior, and the very first step towards changed behavior is owning your fuck ups without any shame attached to them because you’ve forgiven yourself. <br><br>And I know this following statement may sound harsh, but I think you should step away from the internet and make your spiritual/growth journey more personal than public. Because as people have stated, this seems a little icky."
"Oop. I’m in with Oxford now, better do some half assed apology"
Have you apologised to trisha?
is this train wreck still on youtube
Why does she say &quot;got my lick back&quot; over and over when she clearly doesnt know what it means hahahaa she will never not be cringe
"We’re in a timeline where Nikocado lost the weight, Gabbie apologizes, and Mr. Beast is getting cancelled up the wazoo"
LMAO
Where&#39;s You know who&#39;s apology? This so preformative
"Apologizing to her family, she forgot to say &quot;im sorry for telling everyone i grew up EXTREMELY poor, (literally used those exact words), when i definitely did not...&quot;"
"After all the horrible lies youve said about R.O. you did not even mention her by name. Shame, I think youre beyond the point of changing"
"Flashbacks to my abusive father expecting my forgiveness cause Jesus forgives us all 💀 go and forgive yourself then, but it&#39;s up to the hurt person to decide if your apology if enough, babe"
Just needed a ukulele
Yikes
Woah. Haven&#39;t seen you since that meltdown on tiktok. I see you are still religious. Do you still believe god is talking directly too and through you? Do you still believe you are the next messiah? Genuine questions. You look better and happier now. I do hope you apologize to people privately though. Its much more meaningful.
Jess
You are not using &quot;i got my lick back&quot; correctly. Just so you know. I think you mean got revenge?
Appropriate that you posted this on 9/11 in an attempt to give previous disasters a run for their money. What an absolute joke.
Girl......delete this re record it and be genuine youre not even using the slang correctly either getting your lick back means getting revenge
Taking this with a grain of salt 🤝🏻
running to religion won&#39;t change what you did to her. how can you not even feel guilt? disgusting.
Repeating I got my lick back for everyone you’re saying sorry to is not an authentic apology
When youre so toxic you realize you should issue a mass apology to anyone who ever met you but still youre toxic so you cant muster up sincerity:
She can’t name everyone.  There’s so many this video wb 3 hrs long
s m i l e s
The fuck was this….
"God does not suddenly absolve you of your sins because you believed in him a little more, you cannot be THIS vague in your apologies, because it isn’t one.<br><br>If you believe in your god enough, i think he’ll manifest, but i hope if no one else will, your insane god does."
"“I’m sorry if you feel like I did …” that is NOT an apology. An apology without accountability is just deflection and not a legitimate apology. If you can not say in the same sentence “(Name) I’m sorry I did (x,y and z) to you and that it made you feel (negative emotion here).” You just want to save face and you’re only trying to move on for YOURSELF and not help others move on by addressing them by name, saying what you did and how it made them feel, the aftermath, both publicly and privately. My toddler apologizes more sincerely than this."
"This was not a real apology. You NAME the people you are apologizing to directly. I can see the need to apologize publicly because these dramas and clashes were public, but you should have addressed it directly to the people you hurt and the part you played in the drama."
"This is genuinely the most preformative apology I have ever seen. You have put on the clothes of Christianity, of the love of Christ, but you do not display His love or His compasion. You are a pharisee. I hope you heal, but I hope everyone you ever hurt heals first. <br>&quot;Depart from me, for I never knew you&quot;"
RO
also &quot;get my lick back&quot; means you got your revenge essentially lol I understand that you meant you learned your lesson lol
"Ummm... Two quick little things. At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svKhRBAkqY&amp;t=720"">12:00</a> asking for apologies from others when you are apologising is not the time or place. Secondly, its hard for a video to seem sincere when its got midroll adverts.<br>But! Keep growing and getting better, if Jesus is showing you the way, keep following his example and his spirit. We all stumble but he forgives us far more times than we ever forgive others."
Is this satire?
"I also want to say that if the whole entire internet had the same opinion, that you were in the wrong, and that YOU were being ab^sive and toxic towards R.O and J.S. that should be a clear sign that we’re right. There will rarely ever be a situation where the whole entire MAJORITY, out of thousands and thousands of people have the same opinion on a situation and be wrong. We all said you were in the wrong in how you treated those women, because you objectively were. Get rid of your insanely high ego and just apologize. Tell them you’re sorry. Directly."
offering up your &#39;forgiveness&#39; during an apology vid (like you expect apologies are owed to you) is WILD
I wonder how many dislikes this video has
You have not changed at all :) still as toxic as ever
This video is givinggggg.....<br>(Fill in the blank) 😂
"&#39;sorry&#39; as a youtube apology literally means nothing, your apparent &#39;growth&#39; should be shown through actions. your actions show you to not be sorry and incredibly self serving. amen."
"Yeah, pro tip: laughing obnoxiously after every &quot;apology&quot; really doesn&#39;t sell it in any way as something genuine and meaningful, it completely cheapens it and makes it meaningless. You still speak and carry yourself like a high-schooler. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svKhRBAkqY&amp;t=347"">5:47</a>-<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svKhRBAkqY&amp;t=356"">5:56</a> holy shit this is so dismissive and what an insulting and underhanded attempt at an apology. If you actually had any real integrity and guts you&#39;d be ashamed by this.<br><br>This entire video is, &quot;I treated you like shit, I used you, gossiped about you, didn&#39;t compensate you, emotionally abused and took advantage of you, and only cared about myself.....and I&#39;m sorry that you seem upset about that.&quot; There is not a single ounce of sincere remorse for doing any of these things, all you did was half-heartedly throw around vague platitudes."
"If you were sorry and had learned anything, you wouldn&#39;t be shaming women for what they wear and calling Rachel Oates dumb and uncreative in a very recent interview. While I understand mental health struggles and I hope nothing but the best for you in your healing, I very much stand with the women you harmed."
"When someone gets their &quot;lick back&quot; that means they got their revenge against someone who wronged them. It does not mean they got a taste of their medicine or learned their lesson. <i>Not being a jerk, but I would want someone to tell me if I we&#39;re unintentionally saying I&#39;d gotten my revenge against multiple people I&#39;m trying to apologize to.</i>"
Smiles
Girl... bless your heart
Smiles
girl this is just the next phase in the lineup of never looking at your real problems
"I want to support you but unfortunately a lot of hateful Christians has made me skeptical of religious people. Do you love and accept LGBTQ+ people? Do you believe being gay/being in a gay relationship is a sin? Do you believe in a woman’s right to choose? I just need to know to fully support and be happy about this, and I’m sorry about that. Many people have a “hate the sin, love the sinner” mentality and I’m not sure that’s fully accepting either. Ugh. I just want more public examples of progressive, accepting, loving Christians."
Maybe learn a lot more about the true meaning of the words humble &amp; empathy and try again. Your words are meaningless just like how you described your content.
Smiles
ugh she is not sorry AND I CANT STAND HER NEWFOUND ZEALORTY
"Why can&#39;t you apologize like real people do? Like what&#39;s the point of this, besides making you look better?"
"She knows exactly what she is doing. If this were genuine, it wouldn&#39;t be monetized. If this were genuine, she would be naming names and citing things she actually is sorry for. This is just another skin she will shed when she sees it hasn&#39;t made anyone fall back in love with her."
I&#39;m loving your &quot;woman of the Lord&quot; arc.
Im embarrassed for you.
"Manic episode 2.0, everybody grab your popcorn"
now apologize for using “got my lick back” incorrectly 😂
Stop using &quot;got my lick back&quot; when you clearly dont know what it means. So cringe
Why can’t people just be normal?
Are you gonna apologize to you know who
This was the longest 17 minutes of my life. Also if you were really sorry you would actually acknowledge all of the hurt you caused others! Name them directly and apologize sincerely.
"Laughing during an apology, reading it, not apologising to people 1 on 1 and most of all making money from it is NOT an apology!!!! Still the same old Gabbie but trying to use Christianity as a crutch."
Shoulda borrowed a ukulele and some Laura Lee crocodile tears girl 😭
2024 we love accountability
"I feel so bad for this girl. It&#39;s clear her whole life is chasing something, and trying to fill a hole. Every chapter is filling the hole with something new. Now it&#39;s the God arc. Crazy."
You sure said a whole lot without really saying much of anything at all. You’ve been consistently disappointing for quite a while now.
Girl...
Yeah.. you haven’t changed.
home girl said “if I caused you trauma… I feel you. sorry about that” <br>WHAT?????
"I am an atheist, but I do find it very beautiful and amazing what religion can do for some people. Turning to faith is anyone&#39;s decision, and im so glad she found healing and happiness through god."
Sorry if i hurt you hehe 🙏🏻 😊- Gabbie
Are we not going to approach the actually apology that you need to give to J.S. becauee to me this spews bull until you could actually do that. And even just mentioning hey like that apolgy was a personal one and i called her on emailed her personally off camera and i would totally believe this.
New addiction = god
"Somehow makes an apology to ‘everyone’ all about herself. It’s easy to throw out a general apology. <br><br>Name the people you have hurt, otherwise the apology is meaningless"
What does 9/11 have to do with your apology
"Gabbie, I say this with LOVE… you saying “I got my lick back,” throughout the video, incorrectly, is really iconic."
Still pushing that NPD I see
"Gabbie, you reading the comments on this one?"
I don&#39;t understand making apologies content.
U forgot to whip out an ukelele
This was for no one other than herself. She’s rebranded again and wants to pull the attention. Anyone who is truly selfless would not be tainted or even entertain anything to do with social media
"Oh great, now she’s singing"
"The god stuff is getting kinda tired, it would be nice if you did a video without mentioning religion"
"This is great on the surface but she clearly has not changed, if you’ve seen her new TikTok’s she’s completely flip flopping between this new narrative she’s trying to portray and between the old Gabbi with very wrong and messed up views on how the world works in her screwy little head. It’s a very lazy attempt of trying to convince people of who she is when really, she has not changed and that’s very evident with that questionable Oxford interview. You can see how bitter she STILL IS over getting negative criticism over her book. 😅 Bro get over it, not everything that comes out of your mouth is pure gold."
Is this an apology or you sidestepping accountability?
"great to see you taking accountability for your past actions and behavior. everyone is deserved of second chances, wishing you all the best in your new chapter 🤍"
Having you with us still is an incredible gift. ❤
This is unhinged 😅
yeah... it&#39;s time to unsubscribe
"We all know you wouldn&#39;t apologize unless you absolutely had to, your motives? im assuming money."
Gabbie the Bad Karma and Pillowcase music videos were so iconic :(
An apology is not making excuses and blanket statements of &quot;i&#39;m sorry to anyone I ever&quot;...... nice plug for your new righteousness oh so glad you could plug a cover.  humble sincere apologies to the person and not to the internet for views. disgusting.
scary
"Yall, she did the thing they all do when they say they&#39;re sorry, and don&#39;t mean it, she fucking monetized it. <br><br>Gross girl. Gross. Just do the apology, post it without making money on it, and move on."
"this doesn&#39;t feel genuine to me but if she&#39;s happy on the path she&#39;s on and she feels like she&#39;s moving forward with grace and humility then good for her, i hope she gets what she deserves in the end."
I’m sorry to everyone and no one at the same time. Girl
"No offense, but you should put more effort into your content, thats up to you though ! I miss your old youtube videos. :) As a long time supporter im so proud to see you doing better regardless❤️❤️"
"Yeah, probably need a better apology than that. I feel like you’re just saying it so you can say that you’ve “apologised”"
"This feels so healing. Even if they never see it, I&#39;m glad you did this."
Smile
She sounds INSANE. Now she’s just a crazy religious person.
"When people have garbage pasts and suddenly come out as a devote Christians or &quot;spiritual&quot; it always comes across as disingenuous. This IS disingenuous, I smell bull. Apologize to the people who need to be apologized to (say their names) and do not make a spectacle of it."
"Gabbie I really wanted to support you. Especially after the release of “Where did I go” - it’s such a strong song and I was so excited to see your growth. But to make this tone death apology video when the other day you were called R achel Oat es a talentless loser is so unbelievably out of touch. Gabbie it’s time to let the past go. You did bad things but you can move on. Focus on your art, leave everyone alone. But the work into your art, like your poetry but make it good. Not Instagram Rupi Kaur trash. You can do well, you prove it with your lyrics. Let’s get something out we can all be proud of."
Loved the video but the advertisements were probs not necessary
Trisha paytas????
"Is there anyone who missed the way Gabbie was? I want the story times back. I want the uncensored music back. I applaud the progress she has made, but as an agnostic atheist, I feel she pushes the Christian thing way too hard. I&#39;m sticking with her, but she&#39;s confusing me right now, and I feel conflicted.."
I can say from experience - letting go like this (whether you are apologizing or accepting apologies) brings so much peace to your soul. What a great place for you to be at in your journey ❤
at least Colleen Ballinger was sensible enough to provide shitty ukulele to soften the narc delulu vibes<br><br>You just exposed your true self to your friends in Christ.
please please please PLEASE do not delete your music. at the time that you released them I was GOING THROUGH IT and it majorly contributed to saving my life. I understand it not resonating with who you are and respect it but please 🙏 😭
"I know you’re tryin Gabbie, just be real.. let go for real"
Are you still selling shirts with the Cross on it? Because that doesn&#39;t seem right to do.
"This girl is still doing apologies😂😂, someone need to take her phone asap"
Aren&#39;t you in a bit of hot water because you tried to sell Tana&#39;s underage SR &quot;story&quot; to tabloids when you were in hot water? Washing yourself clean of sin is not this but to admit you have done that and apologize to Tana.
This is the biggest bunch of B.S. ever
"Oop. Must be a new single dropping, Gabbies starting her bs again 🙄 Christians arent stupid Gabbie, this pandering is actually quite offensive. Either apologize directly or not at all. So gross"
I actually expected to hear Jessis name... feel stupid now
"I think we’re all tired of the manic episodes and bullying you spew on the internet. You are STILL insulting and going after people, completely unprovoked, even now. Real growth would be consistent; this is just performative."
The worst apology video ever
People are gonna make so many videos lol
"if this is the right path for you &amp; it feels true to your soul, i’ll believe you. i feel that this isn’t the right path for you, the versions of you that i got to know. i could be wrong, but diving back into a topic &amp; community that already failed you once, right after experiencing some extreme pain &amp; loss of your good name just seems like you’re clutching onto anything that will help you forget what happened, or an over correction. am i wrong?"
"As soon as you say down I said “whoa, she looks amazing” and not in a “your hair looks great or your face or body”. It’s an aura you have now! You’re glowing!"
"Matthew 5:24 “first be reconciled with your brother then offer your gift at the altar.” Rachel Oates pointed out that you did not reach out to apologize, so what you are doing with this “apology” completely contradicts what you believe in. As a Christian, you should probably listen to what Jesus says. If you are claiming to be a Christian act like one and actually try to apologize to the people you’ve hurt."
THERES BABIES ON THE STREET! WAKE UP!!
I was finna watch this then I saw the comments 😂
"As someone who has ordered everything you’ve put out on look design   , I’ve personally haven’t had any issues or problems with it! I understand it’s a small company right now and I know that you are trying your best ❤😊"
Is this a BoJack Horseman parody? <br><br>...Is this a crossover episode?!
At least she is trying to apologize and she admited she is a handful thats something
nah
"Proud of you, girlie. You&#39;ve grown so much. We LOVE an accountable queen🫶"
LMAO she &#39;found god&#39; okay girl
"It’s been so beautiful to see how Christ is changing you from the inside out. 2 Corinthians 5:16- therefore if you are in Christ you are a new creation, the old is gone and the new is here!"
"Yikes. Insincere, performative and virtue signaling to the enth degree. This was not it, at all."
Gabbie this is growth im glad ur in a better place and happy now but for all the fans please don’t delete he music that is a true gift u have with ur art. Your music is amazing please don’t take it away.
yikes
"PLEASE don’t remove your old music gabbie!! music is healing for a lot of people, even if you may not stand by the subjects in those songs now you can look at it as an example of your growth to yourself. you put art into the world and people connected and resonated w it to this day, that’s beautiful and you shouldn’t let go of that 🥺 plus honestly + honestly encore are pop bibles"
Needs more ukulele
Gabby you’re doing so much better! You’re glowing💜
Gabbie is literally the only person that thinks literally GIGGLING during “apologies” is acceptable
"You seem at peace which is great to see. I hope you’re also considering giving specific, personal apologies to a few people who could really use some of that healing"
"Ew, gross."
Would you ever re-release old songs without profanity? Cause a lot of them are felt connected to and without the cursing I think is still good
"Shouldve watched Gabriel Zamora’s apology prior to this, Gabbie"
The unprompted bible belting at the end really tied this together
This is so.. misguided.
I mean there are people who deserve an apology but have her blocked everywhere and don&#39;t want to ever hear their names from her mouth. So she should apologise for specific situations without naming names or just not do that bullshit performative video at all
"Hi Gabby. I just wanted to let you know that ‘get your lick back’ is actually from African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and refers to getting one’s revenge. I am not sure this is what you mean in this context, as it seems that you are referring to karma coming back onto you."
"Hi Gabbie, I would like to say I completely understand that you’re embarrassed by some of your music. I would also like to remind you it was a time in your life that ultimately put you on the path you’re on. It also means something to your listeners, including myself. <br>For those reasons I don’t think you should delete music. 😢"
"noone enable her, she&#39;s not really sorry, she&#39;s just doing this to save face. true redemption will only come through her actions going forward, not her words in a single video"
I wasn’t expecting 9/11 to come up lol
She lives in her head
"God is good. Your testimony is a powerful one that can probably help so many. Some people call it religion, I personally call it a relationship. Many blessings on your journey. It&#39;s so good to see you in his light. Jesus is King 💗🙌🏼"
"The Holy Spirit doesn&#39;t shame, you are correct. They convict. I hope you also reach out to people like Jess separately and truly do apologize with grace and compassion and accountability. <br><br>As someone who also has issues emotionally and as a Christian, let God lead in everything, let His voice shine through before your own."
ummmm what’s going on!
APOLOGIZE TO RACHEL OATES
Queen
Part 2?! Lol because what is this.
Please don&#39;t delete your music over profanity
i disliked
Why am I crying!!! Beautiful Gabby! I’m so happy for you!
LMAOOOOO adding in the 911 prayer is so random
"I’ve been here since vine. I’m also a follower of Christ and it really fills me with joy to see your journey and vulnerability to share your experiences and mistakes and being accountable. Because yes, no one is perfect, but it’s so rare that people actually admit it. Thank you for sharing and thank you for that prayer ❤"
What if I’m a monsteeeeer
Good morning
you should apologize to rachel directly.
Gabbi Hanna found Jesus!!!! i’m so proud of how far you’ve come ❤
wow gabbie how nice of you lol
Been here from vine to now. Love ya!
You monitized an apology???? 😭
Wow there&#39;s no pleasing people.
Love when an apology video is monetized like what?!
"If she is apologetic about her creative choices, that’s her prerogative. People saying she shouldn’t apologize when she was obviously convicted about this shows a lot of disrespect, even if the intentions are good."
Speechless.
Got that Holy Spirit glow babe... so so happy that you found Christ 🤍 The fruit is evident!!!
Can you apologize for using the phrase &quot;lick back&quot; incorrectly? Its making me cringe and i am now one of your victims. Thanks.
"This is amazing Gabbie. Thank you for being willing to extend apologies to everyone. I do hope one day you’ll realize that your music and art are an expression of God, even when profane and edgy. we love all of your creative output"
"Gabbie, I thought your prayer was great. Haters gonna hate. Let them play their games. We will be happy instead. I’m really proud of you."
"The past is prologue, the future is now."
I mean honestly mad respect for keeping the comments on. Like literally they&#39;re all awful lol. I haven&#39;t watched your channel since the storytime days and I have no idea what all the drama is even about tbh
i’m here so quickly hello
Why is it always extremes with Gabbie? Everything you do doesn’t have to become your entire personality or persona. I miss old Gabbie so much
"sorry I&#39;m late... I lost all concept of time ❤️🎶 Good for you, gabbie ✨"
"The world is always looking for the next person to crucify. None of these people personally know you or your journey to God. Let the hate come. Don&#39;t worry about it Gabbie, cause at the end of the day, Jesus died for them too. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. Anyone who points fingers at you, is no less of a sinner. We&#39;re all equal in the eyes of God. Whatever you attempt to do in this video is appreciated and don&#39;t look back after this. Move forward. The people who hate you today will be gone tomorrow but your name will not so soon be forgotten. God bless you ❤"
"Even with everything done or said i still love you gabs, you are transparent and that&#39;s what matters"
🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
Gabbie! It’s so encouraging to see your transformation through Christ. I’m battling with dying of the self and seeing someone like you devote yourself to Christ gives me so much hope and peace
help not u tryna come for other ppls numbers yet u can barley crack 20k views on all ur vids 😹😹😹😹😹😹
"I am and was a HUGE fan of you through thick and thin, and i am PROUD of you, you were honestly my favorite creator since i was watching Vines on my sister&#39;s phone when i was a kid. you have pushed me to pursue music, and with our views aligning with faith the exponential change you have shown, i now look up to you even more. Thank you."
you should probably not be singing a hymn in an apology
"Gabs! I’ve been here for a while now, and I love how much you have grown!  On the topic of you saying you weren’t the best role model. I just want to say even though you may not believe it, you have actually raised me through the years! I am who I am because of you! You literally made me a better person through the years! Fr!  I’ve looked up to you since I was 13! And I’m 20 in 15days,which sounds crazy tbh. I love you ! You’re doing great! I hope you’re having a wonderful day/week 😊❤"
You’re still alive? Any particular reason why?
I recently joined a church and found a home there and hadn&#39;t gone in over 20 years. and thank you for what your doing it shows alot of strength and growth. I don&#39;t comment on your stuff but I love your content the newer content for sure I love. Thank you.
If God is so powerful. He could have given you the courage to apologize name by name publicly. But you didn&#39;t. I do not think you grew.
"Also as someone who was personally affected and traumatized by 9/11, thank you for praying for us. I almost lost my dad that day but God was with him and brought him back home safely to me. I lost him to 9/11 related cancer 23 years later. March 26,2024 ❤.  Never forget 🥺"
Is she gonna pull a Brittany Dawn and turn her channel towards religion?
You were my whole childhood
Spiders. Wonder how many are in those tree choppings?
I love you! ❤
Was ricegums apology in this
This was beautiful! What a Great God He is 😢.. Thank God for saving you!!.. Thank you Jesus for dying in the cross for depraved sinners like me.. for dying to change us and make us new creatures.<br><br> It&#39;s been so moving to see your conversion in real life❤ Love from Chile
How to apologize:<br>Hey (specific name/professional) I’m sorry for doing …. (Don’t forget to include how you actually hurt them)
we’re proud of you hon
Well... at least you didn&#39;t break out a ukelele. 🤷‍♂
"You know what? I WILL be missing all my favorite videos of you that you have removed, but if it&#39;s your journey to become a better person, then I&#39;m all for it. &lt;3"
You really went off the deep end😂😂
I LOVE YOU GABBIE I WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT YOU
"Look, is this a better apology than a hell of a lot of other YouTuber apologies? Absolutely yes. But coming from someone who isn&#39;t religious, it feels insincere. If you have gone through a spiritual journey, and have had a turn in faith, good for you. If that journey taught you that you have a lot of apologies to give, great. The problem comes in mentioning that you realized you need to apologize BECAUSE you turned to Christ, rather than apologizing because you wronged people<br><br>The thing that a lot of people who are religious don&#39;t understand is that we don&#39;t subscribe to any of the same beliefs. If Jesus has forgiven you, that&#39;s fine. But just like my last point, saying that makes it feel insincere. It makes it seem like that you don&#39;t actually care if WE forgive you, because Jesus did, so we don&#39;t matter. Whether or not you want it to come across that way, mentioning religion so heavily in an apology makes it really easy for it to come across as insincere, self-actualizing, and non personal"
Truly can’t believe it was 10 years ago. I remember tweeting about your first video.
🤨
"Girl be you, no reason to feel sorry for getting work, that people only dream of. Good for you, There is a difference between doing something wrong and owning up and then there is kissing ass. I&#39;m just saying that you are a strong beautiful woman, and you should not feel ashamed of your gifts in this life."
It would be great if you name people because obviously a lot of sorry have to definitely have names in mind . But i guess this is he best we’ll get i do have to say there is now some self awareness but i feel like the next phase hopefully isn’t the born again Jesus psychosis phase if Jesus saved you great love it but don’t try to make that your whole new personality your more then that.
gabbie youve grown SO much! so proud of you! God bless you and please continue to be a vessel to help others through your music and platforms! &lt;3
oh brother ….
"This makes me so proud, we LOVE accountability ❤️"
Thegabbieshow is back and absolutely glowing⭐️✨✨🩷😊
i’m proud of you for your growth! you’re supposed to fuck up your life in your 20s lmao
"y&#39;all need to let it go and take Gabbie for what she is, flaws and everything hahah, not every content creator needs to be a saint or perfect person"
"Thank you Gabbie for your loving care. I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve found your peace.<br><br>PLEASE dont delete your songs from Amazon, i know some of them swear and such, but i really rely on some of those. Even with fowl language, your music has still done so much good, and I still need it. At least please dont until I&#39;ve jad a chance to actually buy them. I know you dont want them out there, but some of us really rely on them for comfort and/or understanding. Particularly for me, they&#39;ve helped me to process the anger inside of me, when I&#39;ve been raised to never be angry. Please let those songs live... at least until i can save the money to buy them 😅❤"
"Omg, on 9/11?? This is NOT YOUR DAY!"
"I can only comment on the parts of the apology that apply to me, but thank you, I forgive you, and I&#39;m so happy for you"
"You are aware you seriously hurt people, right?"
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Didn’t expect you to become a fundie
It&#39;s okay Gabbie girl !!
Three minutes in and this is atrocious.
"Glad to see you&#39;re doing much better, Gabbie."
I’ve never been this early
"gabbie, you look beautiful and so fucking healthy🤍"
You look like maya rudolph
Here for this! 🎉 Also: EFD is sooo real!

I’m so happy to see you grow over the years❤
I love you
I love you Gabbie always wishing you the best in life 💖 feel like I’ve grown up with you and watched you evolve through the challenges of life! <br><br>You’re just always so real and true to yourself x
This was unexpected
Gabbie is one of my fav creators what a queen

Heal and let live.
hey queen
♥
Sim Islands
watching now-cant wait to see what this about
This is just an easy way out to say you did the right thing.... how about making a list and privately reach out to everyone you wronged.
When I watch your content it fills me with such a calmness that helps me fall asleep at night I’ve even spent some nights falling asleep to your songs.  Thank you for this new content you’re creating and I hope it brings you the happiness you deserve.
HEY QUEEN
First gabby video I’m watching in about 4 years. When I saw she had made an apology I had to come here and watch. I’m glad that shes had so much growth from the issues that happened. I hope life stays peaceful for gabby
Hi
oh jesus christ this narcissist&#39;s pulling the bullshit &quot;i&#39;m a christian&quot; redemption arc?
This is crazy cause Ik this about to be ranked in a tier list
who’s Rachel?
pause what happend now?
I
You better apologise to amberlynn Reid now for what you said to twitter . You triggered her binge monster.
Omg
"I’ve read a few comments here saying this wasn’t genuine because it wasn’t more specific and initially I agreed but when I thought about it I understand why you didn’t name names. Those people probably wouldn’t have wanted that especially if they’re still upset over certain situations. I do have two small criticisms though. Regardless of your beliefs bursting into song in the middle of an apology video probably wasn’t the best choice. The last person to use their musical talents in an apology video is still being side eyed for it. You probably should have edited out the giggles too. You were heading in the right direction. You just veered off course. As for the rest of it, it could have been worse."
every time you start to recover you fuck up. get it together
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svKhRBAkqY&amp;t=711"">11:51</a> no apology should include the words “I forgive you….”"
the YouTuber to Christian pipeline strikes again
"The self-reproaching soul (al-nafs al-lawwāmah) is something by which God (Exalted Be His Name from weakness, or associates) has sworn, in the Quran. <br>I have never heard of Hanna until this very week, so I know nothing about much which is Hanna related. <br>And I can’t, nor should I, entertain a judgment on Hanna’s whereabouts onto her journey.<br>Still, on the surface at least, as a believer in God, The Creator, The Self-Standing The Exalted (from the need for sustenance, from having to take an associate, a spouse, or progeny), I can say that some bits of her apology resonate with the practice of (Continual) Repentance in Islam.<br>Other chunks of the video, register to me, as Nurture Constructs which are to be shielded from unsolicited advice"
"I will give you another chance. I mean, who am I to judge you. I believe in giving people chances. I have so many thoughts about this video that we don’t have time for. I’ll be paying attention, I have faith in you. Health &amp; Peace"
"bro started with the sigh, i am NOT watching this <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY""></a>"
❤️❤️
"i don&#39;t doubt that you had every intention to apologize but i don&#39;t think you either needed to do this on video, instead of talking directly to the people involved, or that you could make it so random and don&#39;t say specific names or situations. i am sure the God you believe in forgives you, but he does not have a youtube account. if you&#39;re going to do this for others, do it right and do it to their faces."
Jackson Sarah Taylor George Walker Matthew
I really hope some younger 15-25 year olds find this video. It&#39;s ok to not be edgy and just be happy and yourself and not trying to fit in. ♥️
God had to teach you empathy… interesting
"Ahhhh she gonna turn into a religious bigot, lmaoooo"
Damn not losing broken girls video that was a masterpiece
Was she getting political in the prayer at the end?
i do think that u had made good points in the past though and though u did wrong there were comments made about you that werent even based in argument and about your ED that could have been not said
Love you Gabs. ❤ One of the reasons is I can relate to you in some ways. 🥹 You’ve grown so much and I’m so proud of you. ❤️❤️❤️<br>- Gabby from patreon

I LOVE that song 🥹
10 years ago today??
"Okay the singing random is amazing! That&#39;s your gift (in my opinion, which is meaningless because I don&#39;t actually know you) to bring glory to him. I recently was convicted of stewardship of your talents. Mathew 25: 14-30"

We love you gabbie

🤍🤍🤍
Nice growth Gab!
Oh wow I got here fasttttt
This is so inspiring. ❤
You look so much happier and I&#39;m happy for you ❤.
This is a little much it seems ur just apologizing for being a teenager. 😂😂
"I&#39;m gonna say a few things as I watch. <br><br>First off: I like that you took notes and, in my own opinion and viewpoint, took the time to really think about who you owned apologies to.<br><br>I like that you didn&#39;t name names, showing that you respect people&#39;s right to privacy and anonymity. Watchers of your channel aren&#39;t entitled to know who exactly your apologies are for. <br><br>I don&#39;t know if you have apologized in private, I can only hope that you did. It&#39;s not for me to judge. <br><br>I will say that i can tell this is rehearsed, so to some, it feels inauthentic, but again, you&#39;ve obviously put thought and care into these apologies, and some people expect some tearful emotional apology when real life isn&#39;t always like that, sometimes as humans we get smacked in the face with our bad behavior and have to realize how we messed up,  the important thing is to grow and move on. <br><br>Im glad that you have found Jesus and are in your own time making these apologies, and we as watchers of your content are allowed to go on this journey with you, we aren&#39;t entitled to any of this, but you Gabbie chose to share....<br><br>And for that, I thank you. God bless."
♥️♥️♥️
"I never liked you or your content, but as a fellow Christian, I believe you and can see that there is a change happening. To everyone judging this girl, just because someone becomes a Christian, doesn&#39;t mean that they will suddenly do everything perfectly. Yes she hasn&#39;t apologized to anyone directly, but she&#39;s acknowledging that she has done wrong to people. Past Gabbie would never say such a thing. Change takes time. I think the fact that she&#39;s aware of her past wrongs and that she needs help is progress in itself. If you don&#39;t believe that Jesus can change people, just watch. He will prove you wrong. Jesus loves you Gabbie, and forgives you. As long as you continue on this path, He will change you from the inside out!"
Just seems like she got a new therapist
❤❤❤🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🤲🏻🤲🏻🤲🏻♥️♥️♥️
Omg could we see Gabbie on the JustTrish pod?!?!?! ❤🫶❤️
so here for this !! :) love u lots
❤❤❤❤❤
"Gabbie………woah………this is fucking something. Still at the beginning so I don’t wanna speak too soon but babe I love to see this…. So much omfg. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svKhRBAkqY&amp;t=252"">4:12</a> wow.❤"
God bless you Gabbie Hannah you had me in tears you are doing Gods work now His armor is protecting you keep following Jesus 🙏 as for you others i ask this what would Jesus do? Do you ?
Firsttttttttttt✨
♥️🙏🏼
Love this❤️
a new episode... (schizoid)
"In a lot of this you&#39;re apologizing for being human. I don&#39;t want to take away the importance of holding yourself accountable in life, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair of anyone to expect humans not to post about their human day to day experiences. Whether that involved someone else or not. Perhaps you can choose to post more thoughtfully and / or choose your words more delicately, but humans are allowed to speak on experiences that impacted them."
Gabbie always wins 💯 America&#39;s Chelsea Lee Art. Stay making em seethe queen.
Im so happy for you!! I became Christian some months ago and the Lord truly transforms the heart
♥️♥️♥️
The only thing lacking here is ukulele.
❤
"Okay this is not a comment for Gabbie. This is for people who wanna talk theology. If believing in religion doesn’t make you a good person, that’s great! You’re soul is grown &amp; you’re capable of self trust, I’m happy for you :). Getting to this level means you should understand empathy, kindness, and compassion. There is no reason to hate God-believers. Christ lovers are trying to find meaning outside capitalism, which a great step towards building a world we can live &amp; love. Hate is for them to channel at sin/devil. Love is ours to spread."
So proud of you Gabbie. ❤
"I really respect the way you&#39;ve been healing and growing. As another lady with cptsd, I understand. I wish you well! 🤍✨️💜"
🐑
❤❤❤
Good for her! She seems happier and enjoying her life.
Thank you Gabby. Your words really hurt me back in the day. I’m happy to see you taking ownership
"hi gabbie! i&#39;ve been a youtube watcher since 2015, and watched you on and off since the beginning of your channel. <br>can i pop in and give my point of view of the whole thing, if that&#39;s not too much?<br>while i - and i&#39;m sure EVERYONE - appreciates SO MUCH the thought put into accepting the past mistakes and owning up to it and putting it out there, wouldn&#39;t it be much more appreciated by everyone involved if u directly attached names to the apologies? <br>u cannot apologize to someone that is faceless and nameless. everyone will wonder &#39;is it for me?&#39; and no one will truly FEEL the apology 100%. <br>while i feel u may not want to throw names out there for everyone involved, i&#39;m sure everyone involved wouldn&#39;t mind. your fans WILL wonder (because i&#39;m sure some names you&#39;ll apologize to aren&#39;t a public feud like others) and chit chat, but you can just let them wonder away for why you&#39;re apologizing to some of these people. <br>that would be my suggestion ❤<br>i&#39;m sure my comment will get lost in the sea of comments, but if it doesn&#39;t, do a new video titled: &#39;a long overdue apology (revised)&#39; and i&#39;m sure everyone will be much happier (:"
Wow. Seems like people don’t understand forgiveness like at ALL. I think this was a great and important thing to do Gabbie ♥️ May Jesus be glorified.
"Gabbie you&#39;re more beautiful than ever, inside and out."
it&#39;s wild it took religious fanaticism for gabbie to finally apologize im glad she feels healed but her version of religion reminds me of the one that gave me and my friends and family religious trauma...
This was very much needed.
No ukulele needed
I am very happy for you girly. Happy to see you in a better place and healthy mentally! ❤
I’m so glad to see you are doing better Gabbie&lt;3 wishing you nothing but the best
Omg please don&#39;t take down your music! I love it more than anything!
Sending love Gabbie. I hope you continue to heal and grow.
this is a general apology to mass amounts of people she may not have personal contact with. i’m sure gabbie has had plenty of one on one conversations where she has apologized to the people who matter
Love this Gabbie! Christ is king 👑
"I’m so stoked that your saved! I Got saved and stopped watching your videos, but then I came across you some years later and now your a Christian too! Soo cool"
Self reflection is NOT easy. Thank you for sharing 💕❤️
I am soooo proud of your growth!!! &lt;3
This is so lovely.
im so sad to lose your music. i have followed and loved your music since you released out loud. so many of your songs are so special for so many of us
Damn rewired is done 😪😪😪😪😪
"Oh my gosh, please don&#39;t completely remove your songs or music videos maybe just unlist the ones that don&#39;t align with your morals? They&#39;ve helped me so much over the years and I&#39;m sure I am not alone in that."
Amen
you were decent on vine 🤷‍♀
It’s good to see you well
i love you gabbie!
We forgive you sis 💗 God bless.
I was just thinking. How is Gabbie Hanna doing. And then I looked her up and this is fabulous.
Please come back to filming vlogs. 🎥 <br>Miss you! 🩷🖤🩷
These comments are awful! I was excepting to see such a positive comment section.<br>So happy and proud of you Gabby! 🤍
Praise the Lord for this!!
It’s really sad that you’re deleting all your old videos and some music that meant a lot to some people
I love you so much gabbie ♥️ this was so refreshing.
🎤 🐐 Preach!
i know this is irrelevant so i&#39;m sorry but you look great gabbie 😭
"I am happy that you did this. You have been through so much in your life and career. I still like the music you did in the past (from “Out Loud” up to This Time Next Year), and your current Christian stuff you’ve been putting out has been great. I can safely say that 2024 is the year of big changes for you. You’re not the same Gabbie I’ve been following from your Vine days, but you are the better Gabbie now and I am happy with it. Much love… ❤️❤️❤️"
ur mom
Gabbie I’m so happy your in a better place now and u know we are still here for u no matter what happens ❤ and we will support u keep being positive
We love a taking accountability queen❤❤ I’ve always known you’re a good person deep down 💖💞💝
Love you
Go on just Trish
this is huge of you and im proud of you.
"Gabbie, I’ve been watching your videos since I was probably 10. I’m 19 now and became a Christian 3 years ago. At 10, I would’ve never expected you to blossom into faith. At 19, I couldn’t be more thrilled for you! We may never meet in person, you may never see this, but I’m so looking forward to meeting you in Heaven ❤"
love you so much gabbie!! i recently met you at your new castle performance and it was so wonderful. i’m so happy you’ve been in a better place and am wishing you a long life of success and happiness! ❤️
❤❤❤❤❤
Proud of you Gabbie. God is good.
Hey Gabbie! I&#39;m so proud of you for how far you&#39;ve come. &lt;3 Seeing you change and grow has been such a treasure. &lt;3
Amen 🙌
Beautiful video &amp; Beautiful voice😍😍😍
"I love my look design co shirt. I knew it would take like two months to ship, and then it was a happy surprise when it came."
"Gabbie please please PLEASE don&#39;t delete your music! Your music still means so much to me and many others. They may be against your faith, but they are still yours and they have value in the eyes of your fans and god. Your journey is just as important as the destination, and seeing your change and progression is powerful. ❤"
Amazing. Keep moving up and forward. He is with us ❤ thank you for your prayers.
"You all are way too negative. She&#39;s growing. In the video she mentions being anonymous on stories but still feeling awful about it. Why the hell would she flaunt everyone&#39;s names publicly. Even doing this is vulnerable. You&#39;re upset bc she&#39;s trying to be light hearted and uplifting about the whole situation. Just bc she&#39;s not groveling and begging for forgiveness does not mean she&#39;s not sincere. It&#39;s a message to everyone she hurt that&#39;s she&#39;s sorry and she&#39;s a changed person to hopefully allow conversation in the future. With all your negativity, you should be taking the time to find the thing that allows you to want to apologize and feel more uplifting. Hers just happens to be jesus. <br><br>Gabbie i see you i see that you&#39;re trying. As someone with a personality disorder seeing someone that has those characteristics (trying to not diagnose, but had been worried about it for years now) i know it&#39;s hard but I&#39;m happy for you that you found your peace"
&lt;3 happy for you and proud of you.
Plz start a christian podcast ❤️
"Gabbie this healed my inner child. I feel very inspired to make my own apology video to everyone in my life. I’m so happy you are alive and I get to live on the same planet with you. I love you no matter what mistakes you might have made in the past, we all change, we all fuck up terrible, but we learn and do better! I love you Gabbie Hanna!❤️ Thank you for making this"
This could not have been easy! Thank you to the holy spirit for this prompting and for your obedience. &lt;3
The growth! So proud of you Gabbie❤️‍🩹
"I am so proud of you Gabbie it takes so much courage to admit your missteps and apologize, not everyone will accept it and there will be skeptics but please ignore them and stand strongly rooted on your faith knowing in your heart your genuine intentions and those that matter will see the light of Christ shine through you  🩷🙏🏻"
God bless you Gabbie!! Jesus has been doing His big one on you. I&#39;m so happy for you. God is soooo good. Blessings to you my sister in Christ!!!
"Happy to see you shining, basking in God’s Glory. Amen sister. So happy to see all of us turning to such a revelating, merciful, all-loving, and forgiving God. For He sent his begotten Son so that all who believe shall be saved. I love you Gabbie. Thank you for forgiving me as well, I was on the hate-bandwagon before I found Jesus myself and I cannot express how at peace I am after watching this video. Keep moving forward, never stop believing, stay close to those that you love, and most importantly those who love you. God Bless. See you in Paradise ❤️"

Bro completed the pokedex
Bro&#39;s trying to collect all 72 of em ☠
"I support LGBTQ+, but dude is really speedrunning those genders 😭 🙏"
Me in 5th grade<br><br> trying to figure out how the fuck the moon changes shape every night💀
Wtf<br>Lil bro got an inventory of gender 😭❗
bro genders sound like a forbidden spell bruh
🏻-HUMAN<br>🏼-HUMAN<br>🏽-HUMAN<br>🏾-HUMAN<br>🏿-HUMAN<br>🏳️‍🌈-HUMAN
Bro in fifth grade I was eating glue and crayons
bruh wtf i just asked what your name was?
"I feel like if i read the 10th grade one, my furnitures gonna start levitating"
"Ignore all the hate comments, xenogenders are valid, ur rlly cool btw! :)"
Mine <br>1st grade :straight<br>2nd grade: straight <br>3rd grade:straight<br>4th grade: straight <br>5th grade: straight <br>6th grade: straight <br>7th grade: straight <br>8th grade: straight <br>9th grade : straight <br>10th grade: straight<br>11th grade: straight<br>12th grade: straight<br> (she/her since birth)<br>1-6th grade didnt know about LGBTQA
Bro is has the “how did we get here?” Achievement IRL 💀💀
ROBLOX roleplay names be like:

Being Bisexual is the definition of buy 2 get one free😭😭
bros bio turned into a magical spell💀<br>it would’ve been funnier if his name was Harry.
BRO TENTH GRADE 💀💀💀💀💀💀 bro needs to chill u are labeling urself TOO much you don’t need to find out who you are just act like urself personality
"Oh hey! :3 cool ta see another xenogender user here! I&#39;m cryptidmascgender, webcoric and foxplushicgender! :D"
I support LGBT but OMFG what is the last one 💀<br><br>Edit: pls don&#39;t start fights. If it gets out of control I will most likely delete this comment
I support anyone but I&#39;ve come to a point where this is just insane
Bro Joined a game called &quot;Find the Genders&quot; 💀💀💀💀
"<b>Guitar Riff plays</b><br><br>I wanna be the very best<br>Like no one ever was<br>To catch them is my real test<br>To train them is my cause<br>I will travel across the land<br>Searching far and wide<br>Teach Pokémon to understand<br>The power that&#39;s inside<br><br><b>Pokémon, gotta catch &#39;em all!</b>"
bro is all of the above 😭
"I understand that it’s important to be comfortable in yourself but this is too much, I attend pride fundraisers and activities (I’m lesbian) so I have a lot of experience with trans/enby ppl. Obviously I cant put myself in your shoes- I am not transgender and I’m not claiming to be but a list that size can’t be necessary. It’s inconvenient for you and it’s inconvenient for people around you but more importantly it solidifies this idea that the lgbtq+ community is over the top and not serious. It hands itself to bigots and basically says that it is, in fact, just a phase. Please be careful with videos like this and understand that I’m not telling you how to live your life I’m just concerned at this new direction that gender has taken <br>Also be careful with this comment section it’s kinda toxic and I don’t want that for you xx"
Bro trying to unlock lgbt platinum achievement 💀
Whole ass evolution 💀🙏
They got a whole periodic table of sexualities now
I swear people are gonna start saying there gender is a washer machine or a Cheeto puff😭<br>Edit: thanks for da likes😍💅🏽

Bro went from regular girl to a whole legendary Pokémon character
New achievement: “How did we get here”
Me reading all the rest of them:light work no reaction<br>me reading 10th grade:OH okay thats got a little kick...
"I started as an allly for a while then started questioning pan or bisexual, then i thought I was lesbian and now I&#39;m bisexual and possibly aromantic"
This video would easily kill a Victorian child
What do those all mean I used too many brain cells today
I had a heart attack reading the last one (I didn’t even try to say it out loud)💀
Shes ruined 💀
No way this is not satire
fam did you just label the ingredients on a disinfectant bottle wtf 😭😭
"People complaining about the amount of genders or whatever need to get a grip oml😭 why do they care ffs, it&#39;s not even that hard to get, I took some time to read them all and learn abt them, now I know, if it makes ppl happy and does no harm then why complaining? <br><br>Most of ppl with multiple labels like these are not throwing them around in real life conversations but instead in niche online spaces, they are probably using the easiest ones when dealing with Karens and bigots and terfs and whatever 😭 Also congrats to the ppl in the comments for being straight all your life🎀 be so fr now😭<br><br>TL;DR: To ppl complaining: get a grip, it&#39;s not that deep and if it doesn&#39;t harm you or the person then it&#39;s fine and also not ur problem!!"
In year 5 I will be thinking  how they got the cars in a shopping centre 💀

This is getting out of hand HOW IS LGBTQ RELATED TO DOGS AND ANIMALS WTH? now  I support lgbtq but this is crazy.
🎶sexualities gotta catch ‘em all🎶

Look I support lgbtqia+ but you caught me off guard at the end 💀
Bro unlocked every ability💀
I can&#39;t even tell if this is a joke anymore 😭
Another wtf did i just watch moment
"mister, you went from ‘oh yea I’m gay.’ to ‘I have 82531838918373293628102 genders’ in the blink of an eye 🥲"
No hate but what does that mean at the end? LOL 😭🫶❤️🏳️‍🌈
team Jesus of Nazareth<br> 👇
Bros gender is an unsolved rubix cube 💀
10th bros collecting genders like infiny stones
Like how she becomes more depressed as she “transitions”.
&quot;Sir.. This is a McDonald&#39;s&quot;
I cannot Imagine how long that paragraph is in a legal document under the gender section.
I support lgbtq+ but the last one is so confusing
I’m Lesbian and a Demigirl
"As a trans woman I’m paying this no mind, yall not my kind but good for yall 😌"
no offense but being non binary at TWELVE is fucking insane
"Ok, I respect you and all (I’m an openly trans and aromantic person) but why do you feel the need to be so over specific with your gender? It’s just pointless now, so maybe you should simplify it. This vid is exposed to a bunch of shitty bigots, and now people will think it’s over complicated. Well done. You really don’t need to specify it that much 💀✋"
Ok im gay and i dont know half of those😅
“You may have a Porsche but I collected all the genders!”
Pick one disability 💀
This generation is fucked 💀
In fourth grade I was focused on getting out of special ed 😭
Bro got the Oxford dictionary ahh description 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Bro changed teams more times than Italy💀
0-6=straight<br>7-Heterosexual<br>8-Lesbian<br>9-Bi and pan and poly
My brain sank like the titanic on the last one💀
gotta catch em all 😭
Bro should get a world record with that many sexualitys.
WHAT ARE THESES WORDS MEAN😭
"I wanna be so very queer. Like no one ever was. To catch them is my real test, to use them is my cause. I’ll travel across the net searching far and wide. Teach myself to think that being different makes me cool! Pronouns gotta catch ‘em all! Heart so true! My identity will pull me through, I’ll teach me and I’ll show you! My pronouns!!! Gotta catch ‘em all! Gotta catch ‘em all."
IM SO CONUFSED ABOUT THE LAST ONE HELP 😭
"So, you’re every gender (and apparently other species???), but also non-binary??? I’m so confused"
"Im part of lgbtq and respectfully, dude how the hell 😭🙏 &quot;pLeaSe sIr, give me some more!!&quot; ahh moment."
“Gotta catch ‘em all”  ahh identity
"Dude I&#39;m lgbtq, i have literally never been so disappointed in this community tho. I get everyone now a days is saying. &quot;Everyone is valid!!&quot; But just no. Some simply aren&#39;t going to get respect and they deserve that"
"Bro’s got the whole collection, now lets move onto the second match 😭😭😭☠️"
This is the most weirdest s*** I ever f*<b>***</b> saw
1st grade: Girl 10th grade: ᓵ𝙹!¡|| &amp; !¡ᔑᓭℸ ̣ᒷ
"Yup, we all know as we get older we grow horns. 😂👌"
10th grade bro decided to be everything on the planet😭🙏🙏
Bro just listed the peridoc table for genders 💀💀 i googled ALL of them 💀💀💀
uhm no words.
In fifth grade I was eating glue and paper
Bro became a pokemon💀
Random person: Excuse me uhm.... creature?
Naw 💀
Look how the alphabet letters made this person catch genders like Pokémon 😢😭
"Him in 2025: Hello guys! I officially identify as a strawberry. Ik, ik, so unique and quirky.🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🍓🍓🍓🍓🍓"
These kinds of people act all confident and tell us not to be insecure but then they hate their body so much that they have to change their entire identity
🤮
See how all of it continuously made her unhappy.
I remember the good days when I thought this 🏳️‍🌈 was just a Rainbow flag
Who else is confuzzled👇
Jesus is the only one chain👇
Notice how there’s demon horns when she enter LGBTQ hahaha
The pentagram necklace says it all.
When people say &quot;I want to be quirky!&quot;
Satanic
Bro has the whole bible in her description 💀💀
"You know what? IF YALL THINK LOVE IS LOVE THEN HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT IF YOU GET WATER FROM THE TOILET AND TRY IT AND YOU SAY ITS BAD SO YOU TRY THE GALLON AND ITS BETTER ARE THEY BOTH THE SAME AND MATCH TOGETHER? NO ABUSOLUTEY NOT, SO WATER IS WATER? OR IF YOUR TRY EATING FOOD FROM THE KITCHEN AND EAT FOOD FROM THE GARBAGE THEY STILL TASTE GOOD CAUSE FOOD IS FOOD ISNT IT? <br>👇🏻like if you agree with me"
What the hell did i just watch
"Looks like throughout the video she just gets less happier, secret message much?"
Those.........Those are a lot of............big words for.............my little brain to handle.
Bros adding animal names lol 😂
Almost fainted when i saw the last one💀
5th grade?????? shit back then i would watch cartoons and play with toys 😭
this shits weird af
"From the moment I understood the weakness of my flesh, it disgusted me. I craved the strength and certainty of steel. I aspired to the purity of the blessed machine. Your kind clings to its flesh as if it will not decay and fail you. One day, the crude biomass that you call a temple will wither, and you&#39;ll beg my kind to save you. But I&#39;m already saved. For the machine is immortal. Even in death, I serve your Messiah."
"i&#39;m queer and i find this stupid<br>stop creating these labels to put yourself in boxes, just be who you are and love whoever you want to, live like a normal person"
Instead of making this you should have tried becoming closer to Jesus Christ and being cleansed by his love and becoming pure again
Bros evolving to a whole another life form at this point 💀
9th grade: alright makes sense<br>10th grade: 💀
How tf can you be :They/He/She<br>Like pick one god damnit😂
Finally found another demigirl
This trend needs to stop <br><br><br><br><br>Before you come at me I’m pansexual😭
Bro...when I was in 6th grade I played with lego instead of randomly deciding my sexuality
"What the hell this basically me saying i identity as cat,dog,rabbit,wolf,apple,banana,grape,bag, Walmart bag, Kroger bag,shelf, chicken,taco"
Bro got ‘How Did We Get Here’
"I got 3 words, abbreviated into 1. Whaddafuq."
Bro really said “gotta catch ‘em all”
1st - 5th: 😁<br>6th - 9th:😀<br>10th: 🧙‍♂️
"If the twelfth one came up, it would take up my whole phone screen😭"
bro just slammed his head against his keyboard and told everybody he identifies as that😭
bro js got the &quot;how did we get here&quot; achievement :sob:
Do you just add pronouns when you feel like it or get bored? Or when you just find one that seems cooler than what you had before?
Why do I feel like a new generation won&#39;t start now
I’m so confused rn 😢
"Blud I’m so confused, how did animals even get into this? I thought they were just species not really something you can classify as a gender?😃🙏"
Bro listed the periodic table 💀
"When i was in 5th grade i was playing pokemon , thinking about my gender ."
BLUD IS CASTING HIS FINAL SPELL 💀💀💀😭😭😭
I used to be part of the lgbtq+ community(now I’m straight)and holly cow that’s a lot of sexualities😭🤚
Bro&#39;s collecting gender titles like thanos collected the infinity stones
"Heyy, I’m trans and boyflux too!!., :3"
Bro caught them all 💀
Imagine boeing the father💀💀💀
"this generation I swear, sick to my fucking stomach"
what the actual crap was 10th grade like dang that’s all of lgbtq+ shoved into a person
i’m gay and i didn’t know what any of this meant till like last year! please stop labelling yourself especially at such a young age. ngl this is definitely because of social media
"not trying to be rude in any way, (i i’m not just saying this about you, i’m saying it in general) what happened to this society 😭"
This is kids in 2025
"She/…they? How does that work?<br>Even worse, THEY/HE/SHE! BRO’S EVERYTHING💀💀💀☠️☠️☠️👻👻👻👹"
ew
The genders just kept comin 💀💀💀
Advancement Get! How did we get here?
That escalated quickly 😂😂
The end jumpscared me . I am a lesbian but god what is that stuff
"as a lesbian, i genuinely support u for coming out as trans, but what do the other sexualities mean at the end?"
Bruh in 4th grade I was trying to figure out why some parkour guy follows my car. 💀
Ppl are so delusional these days I swear
Your whole school will hate you
"trans guy here! personally, i don&#39;t believe In xenogenders, but if that makes you happy, I&#39;m not to judge. we had a pretty similar journey!"
"Oh goddess, people in coments always so fxcking cringe, definitely more than feeling comfortable in your own body XD Don&#39;t worry, enby agender 20 yo are with you 💖"
The 10th grade is just casting a spell 💀
Eww
notice how her smile turn from happy to seemingly emotionless
Bro got more chaotic through the years<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I like it <br>This is mine <br>1st doesn’t know<br>2nd doesn’t know<br>3 questioning<br>4th bi<br>5th bi and sometimes pan
Father disappointment speedrun

I support lgbtq+ and all but like I don’t think u can have all the fricken genders at once
&quot;its not my whole personality!!1!1&quot; also them:
“One sip of beer won’t affect my child!”<br>The child:
I just watched a human pick em all like fucking ash ketchum
Calling all straight men in 2024
My journey:<br>0-9 straight<br>10: BI<br>11: religions (straight) bc LGBT is haram
Guys I no longer identify as a girl I identify as a pillow 😂
これを読めば、あなたは嘘に反対します##
Bros sexuality is a 2017 roleplay name
I ALMOST GOT A STROKE READING THAT HELP-
"Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin&#39; I&#39;m a human<br>What I gotta do to get it through to you I&#39;m superhuman?<br>Innovative and I&#39;m made of rubber<br>So that anything you say is ricochetin&#39; off of me<br>And it&#39;ll glue to you and<br><br>I&#39;m devastating, more than ever demonstrating<br>How to give a motherfuckin&#39; audience<br>A feeling like it&#39;s levitating<br>Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting<br>For the day that they can say I fell off, they&#39;ll be celebrating<br><br>&#39;Cause I know the way to get &#39;em motivated<br>I make elevating music, you make elevator music<br>&quot;Oh, he&#39;s too mainstream.&quot;<br>Well, that&#39;s what they do when they get jealous<br>They confuse it<br>&quot;It&#39;s not hip-hop, it&#39;s pop, &quot;—&#39;cause I found a hella way to fuse it"
11th grade: fully brainwashed by mark zuckerburg to fight in the biggest war in human history
“Gotta catch em all”💀
"being bi at 11 years old is crazy, like damn i aint christian but y’all need some jesus"
You literally just proved that kids don’t know what lgbtq is and there for should not be taught it
"Sigh, this generation, is.. disgusting. I miss the times when we aren’t in 2020 yet."
your father left Fashionably late
"bro, really hard to tell them that genders are only have 2.."
I think I know someone you can help you (inhale) Jesus:)
The last one actually stressed me out😭
I’d fail as a parent if my child becomes like this
bro tried inventing a new harry potter spell
I know im gay but WHAT THE FUK? 😭
Disgusting
Are you sure we’re not the same person-
A WWII veteran viewing an Igbt parade:<br>Is that why I fought? I expected more from this generation.
“Gotta catch them all!” <br>ahh moment 💀
i know i’ll probably get hate for this but i don’t care. does anyone else think that younger kids are starting to identify as gay/trans/bi etc because of how prevalent it is in media/mainstream society? even 10 years ago it wasn’t like this. i really feel that kids are almost gaslighting themselves into believing they fit one of these categories. keep in mind it isn’t the kids’ fault- it’s our society’s fault for letting these messages reach YOUNG CHILDREN. come on.
Sin so early is crazy

As a lesbian nonbinary...what the fuck
"Now normally, i don&#39;t care too much. It doesn&#39;t hurt other people.<br><br>Buuuuuuut, this shit changed way too much. This is definitely coming across as just wanting attention or to confuse people. This isn&#39;t an identity anymore, it&#39;s being treated like a pair of pants or a shirt."
might be going down the pipeline
Truly a “gotta catch ‘em all” moment 🤣
The meanings of these flags! (The grey white and pink): demigirl: kinda like a mix of female and non-binary<br>(The yellow white purple and black): non-binary: no gender at all<br>(Blue blue white purple white pink pink): bigender: multiple genders<br>(Blue pink white pink blue): transgender: when a person is one gender and their biological sex does not align with their identity/gender.<br>WHA- WHAT ARE THE REST OF THOSE WHAT 😰
I support LGBTQ+ but bro really just collected genders like they were mini figures
Blud got a Bible verse in his gender 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
FINALLY NOT SOME 8 YEAR OLD SAYING THEY’RE LIKE PAN OR SMTH
"Yep, I went from ally to bi to pan to lesbian. I just wasnt ready to accept that I don&#39;t want to date a guy."
no but like I discovered what the lgbt community was when I was 9 (in year 4) because my teacher was lesbian and she was one of my most favourite teachers ever
How do I change the background to my sexuality?
May the lord fill you with his everlasting love and may he save you from the devil🙏✝️
"I remember when I went on websites and it asked for my gender, it only said  <b>Men or Female</b> CRAZY RIGHT🤯"
I understood half of those words
Nah why does this last part remind of the gray prince zote fight in hollow knight💀
How delusional
you need jesus
Speedrun any % with glitches
Go to Afghanistan i heard they accept lgbtq
This is why you don’t give knowledge of lgbtq to children
I&#39;m in 5 grade I&#39;m bisexual
I love the pipeline where it&#39;s just it starts off at one maybe two things and then you blink and it&#39;s just what happened 💕😅
Turning into a girl to a boy is not considered dumb. So if I said I became an Asexual fettuccine Alfredo would I be respected.
Soy leaniana
That’s awesome! ^v^ Happy for you. :]
this is what happens when you get graped
Delusional there is no actual other way to describe this
Never for Jewish ideology
Bro really said &quot;Gotta catch them all&quot; with all the genders he has 🙏😭
I&#39;m bi❤
"i love 2,6,7,8,10 hairstyles"
I have no idea what someof these genders are 😭 also are you trans if you gain a new gender like i just went from she/her to she/her/they/them
Bro is the true genderfluid
"as a lgbtq+ guy, they aint pokemon!!"
"It would be funny if someone made this, but their whole life it said straight"
"PIN SO PEOPLE CAN SEE<br>stop hating, your just boosting us."
If I don’t feel like a girl dose it mean I’m trans or non binary 🧐🤨
I&#39;ve watched a questioning gay show0-0<br>Help I&#39;m panicking 👁👄👁
Y’all I’m in six grade and this is me lol wth
As an LGBTQ person this is just extreme.
"At that point it aint lgbtq, its LGBTQIANFBFCGFGXGIP2SAA+ LIKE WHAT THE FUCK"
That shit&#39;s like the fucking &quot;How did we get here?&quot; Achievement bruh
This is kinda me gut I&#39;ve always been an Ally now I&#39;m bisexual questioning if I&#39;m also gender fluid
I didn&#39;t even know there was that many...😅
My god I didn’t even know lgbtq infinity stones existed until now
Leviticus 20:13 it is an abomination to the lord for only made man and women <br>REPENT FOR THE LORD IS COMING SOONER THAN YOU THINK <br>DO NOT CELEBRATE SIN

"I support you, but how does having what I think was some 4 different genders work!?"
"Me I wish I still didn&#39;t know about it cause I&#39;ve been straight, pan, bi, lesbian, and still questioning my gender preferences"
Bro done selected all of the above
I’m sorry but this is actual insanity. <br><br>Like I don’t understand why anyone would actually enjoy bogging themselves done with all these labels. Labels that at the end of the day don’t actually mean anything. What happened to the days where boys who were feminine were just feminine boys and girls who were masculine were just masculine girls/tomboys.
Awesome! Me personally I&#39;m a bisexual gender fluid! You do u man don&#39;t worry about the shitty people be you and you&#39;ll be fine :]
"How can you be Trans and Non-Binary, this has to be satire 😭"
bro’s collecting genders like pokemon 😭⁉️
"Being homosexuality is sin 1 Corinthians 6:9-20<br>New International Version<br>9 Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men[a] 10 nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. 11 And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God. Repent turn to Jesus he will forgive you god bless you all god love you"
"Encountering God in the Bible is one of the most fulfilling parts of the Christian life. Learning how God loved and led the people of Israel in the Old Testament helps us to understand “salvation history.”<br>Meeting Jesus in the Gospels, and experiencing his love, mercy and compassion, is often at the heart of a person’s faith. And reading the Letters of St. Paul, and others in the early church, encourages, consoles and inspires.<br>The Bible is the treasured friend of billions of believers.<br>But for many LGBTQ Christians, the Bible can feel like the enemy. In the Book of Leviticus homosexuality is called an “abomination” (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m13e3Uydjw&amp;t=1102"">18:22</a>; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m13e3Uydjw&amp;t=1213"">20:13</a>). And although Jesus never explicitly condemns homosexuality, thought he could have (he is hard on divorce, for example), St. Paul does (1 Cor 6:9-10). The few biblical verses that address homosexuality are used against LGBTQ people over and over: in the political sphere; by religious leaders; on social media; in one-on-one encounters; and, perhaps worst of all, in homilies and sermons in the very churches where LGBTQ people seek to encounter a loving God.<br>By the same token, the Bible proscribes many laws, moral codes and ethical guidelines that modern-day Christians ignore, don’t follow or have rejected completely. For example, even though they honor the Old Testament, Christians don’t stone people who work on the Sabbath (Ex. 35:2). We don’t sell people into slavery (Ex. 21:7). And if someone curses God, we don’t execute them (Lev. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m13e3Uydjw&amp;t=1450"">24:10</a>-16). In the New Testament, St. Paul told slaves to be obedient to their masters (Eph. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m13e3Uydjw&amp;t=385"">6:25</a>-29). He also said that women should be silent in churches (1 Cor 14:34). A now-famous online response to the verses against homosexuality points out even more biblical practices that any thoughtful person would reject today. Besides, Catholics are neither literalists nor fundamentalists.<br>So one response to what are often called “clobber verses” (because people use them to “clobber” LGBTQ people) is to see them in their historical context and remember that even devout Christians shouldn’t do everything that Old Testament commands. Likewise for the Epistles in the New Testament.<br>The questions, though, remain: How can we best understand what the Bible says on homosexuality? What did these passages mean then and what do they mean today?<br>And for LGBTQ Christians, perhaps the most important question: How can we square these verses with Jesus, who reached out to those on the margins? How can LGBTQ people, their friends, families and allies, read these Bible verses?"
"This is mine:<br>1st-4th Grade: Straight<br>5th-6th Grade: Bisexual<br>7th-Now: Transgender and Gay (ftm) 💅🏽💅🏽💅🏽🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 (All I&#39;m going to mention is that I&#39;m a teenager, but I&#39;m not going to specify my age/grade)"
Me:☺️ to:😦
Do you mean gay Aysen you’re part of the LGBTQ community because if you’re a boy then that means that if you’re gay boy that means you like man if you’re a trans man and you like ma’am that’s fine with me but I just wasn’t sure if you know
Bros mom was like ‘I got the whole set’

Everything was great until 6th grade 💀
"What is love? (baby dont hurt me). In all seriousness though, love is patient, love is kind, it does not envy and it does not boast. True love is respecting people, being selfless and having no hatred or jealousy towards them. The ultimate example of love is when God himself put his spirit into his own creation and lived a humble life. He could&#39;ve chosen to come here and make himself known to the whole world but no, he loves us to the point where he puts our wants and needs ahead of his own, this is why God gave us free will, the ability to do whatever we want because he will never force us to do something we don&#39;t want to do. He suffered an extremely painful death, the death me and you were supposed to suffer for our sins. And on the third day, he was resurrected and will now live forever. My friends, this love is the love which Jesus was referring to when he told us to love everyone. He was not talking about the human definition of love (an intense feeling of deep affection), he was talking about the love he himself showed us. My friends, if you love Jesus copy the entirety of this comment and spread it to those who need to see this. May the Holy Spirit guide you my friends."
Listen to the haters lil bro 💀🙏
"Stunned...just stunned 🫢 I hope he&#39;s at least happy like this, but to be frank I don&#39;t get why you would have to go further than transmasc...like ok I get NB (I don&#39;t see how you combine NB with TM though) but I don&#39;t see how genderfaun, boyflux  canisgender, faunagender (it sounds like genderfaun backwards) and xenogender are supposed to help you in any way... like they don&#39;t even make sense at this point =/<br><br>Edit: I wasn&#39;t trying to offend anyone"

"guys, js leave them alone. its ok figuring out your identity.<br>im a bit younger, not like 10 but im trans. i thought i was lesbian, and pan. its totally fine, ppl."
Bro wtf happened in 10th grade?!!!!
And here we memed bisexuals for being indecisive 😂
Bro is debating 20 people at once and still wins
And these are college students? What a waste of money.
This blonde girl thinks she is so much smarter than everyone. I feel bad for whoever ends up with her.
The black girl with the glasses is the most respectful and a rare type of college student who is open to debate without resorting to verbal abuse. She is also aware of the many fIaws within the black community. I commend her.
&quot;Do I not believe racism exists? The Democrat Party is alive and well.&quot; - Charlie Kirk
I am always so impressed with the patience Charlie has when talking to a bunch of brainwashed idiots
Unbelievable how rude and entitled our college “educated” are. They are not being prepared for real life
Basically I&#39;m seeing a bunch of kids talking from emotions instead of actual logic. &quot;Everything is subjective&quot; is probably one of the stupidest things I&#39;ve ever heard
"Remember, when you are dead, you do not know you are dead. It is only painful for others.<br>The same applies when you are stupid.”<br>― Ricky Gervais"
“As a Black woman on a college with an Apple Watch 8 on my wrist I am discriminated”
"I will say, the woman in the Malcom X shirt did seem polite and respectful, she even tried to tone down the ones throwing insults and was annoyed they were interrupting the actual positive debate going on. Nice job miss :)"
"There is no &quot;your truth&quot; and &quot;my truth&quot; there is only the truth. Everyone can have different life experiences and opinions, but just because you have a distinct opinion doesn&#39;t make it &quot;your truth&quot;. Nobody gets to own the truth."
"The young black girl listened, spoke, and was very polite and willing to have a conversation. The rest of the kids were not. I applaud her, shes going places in life ❤"
The one dude calls Charlie an idiot and then immediately has the audacity to claim that he’s being disrespectful to him. The absolute delusion.
It must be exhausting being so politically correct
"I find it interesting that people who have not come to an understanding that we are more than  flesh and blood, have difficulty defining when life begins, and the sanctity of like."
God bless Charlie for standing up to these young idiots.  Fighting the good fight and saying how every rational person feels.  I&#39;m SO SICK of hearing about these entitled folks calling themselves victims.
Everything is not subjective. There’s objective.  There’s indisputable truth.
That little blond girl is exactly what you don&#39;t want your daughter to come home as after she goes off to college.
I love how these Woke kids always tell Charlie to NOT interrupt them then they constantly interrupt him!  Hypocrites.
&quot;I do not want to hear it&quot; was the closest to honesty this loud child got
Blonde at the front had no argument other than being incredibly disrespectful. Clearly has no idea what she&#39;s talking about and regurgitates propaganda.
"Also important to be noted- that these bratty students attempting to debate Charlie, ALL stooped to name calling, because he was RIGHT, and they had no where to go but admit it, or kick and scream in tantrum essentially, by calling him names. <br>So disgraceful."
"He looks like he is talking to a bunch of kindergartens during circle time while they keep interrupting with, &quot;But my mom says....&quot;"
"After viewing numerous videos in which young college age kids speak their minds, I&#39;ve come to a very frightening conclusion: If these indoctrinated, confused college kids represent the future and hope of this country, America is in real trouble."
"The amount of energy it must take to speak truth to these young infected minds, props to you Charlie."
He&#39;s not there to change their minds now. He is planting seeds for them to think about and possibly mature in the future.
Bro said he&#39;s being disrespectful after calling him an idiot. 🤦
When a child thinks she&#39;s clever.....&quot;don&#39;t interrupt me&quot;.....then does nothing but interrupt.
It&#39;s weird how the white woman was more offended and acting more emotional compared to the black women when they were talking about race.
The truth is never subjective. It&#39;s simply the truth.
I can&#39;t help but admire his ability to stay calm and have an open and honest debate in the face of hostility. We genuinely need more people like Charlie in today&#39;s society
The blonde is just regurgitating what her professors told her    She has no idea what she is saying
The shorter lady was chill. She was respectful and wasn’t emotional. Literally everyone else was irrational and disrespectful
&quot;My truth&quot; <br>We used to call that &quot;having an opinion&quot; and not every one counts.
its stupid how these kids want to live in a past that they never experienced instead of improving the future that they are going to experience....
Amazing the blonde haired girl is such an expert on being black
"It seems the girl with the Malcom X shirt actually had an open mind and heart, I love conversations like that it was respectful and actually going some where. Thank to that girl and  Charlie"
How disrespectful those young people are to him. I’m a teacher and know that disrespect is off the charts today.
"Charlie has the patience of a saint, my head hurts just listening to these kids"
I feel bad for their parents because they are paying for this incredible ignorance
She feels like the world is a certain way. Feelings are not facts.
“don’t interrupt me!” while she’s talking over you when you’re trying to speak. She has zero respect.
They just learned more from Charlie Kirk in a few minutes than an entire semester of university.
I salute the young lady with the braids that actually tried to have a conversation and be respectful.
Don&#39;t go into traditional definitions of a &quot;soul&quot; ..they can&#39;t think in depth anyway.. just say its that consciousness she has (but didn&#39;t have at 8 months)
Repeating a question 4 times doesn&#39;t validate your opinion.
"Charlie is really good, it&#39;s not easy keeping up with these people."
The black girl in front actually had a very nice civil discussion with Charlie.  She didn&#39;t just flip out over every statement made from Charlie like the white girl did right next to her.  Good job!
Please dont interrupt me......after shes already asked the question and repeating it. And she insists on showing her ignorance and rudeness instead of walking away after embarrassing herself about the link between the black crime rate and abortion.
People do not listen to understand. They hear to respond.
"I like how her entitlement allows her to cut him off, when she was pretending to have a civil two sided conversation, to firmly say “Please don’t interrupt me.”, and then proceed to repeat the exact same sentence she has already said several times. Refusing to advance the conversation forward, and just repeat until he submits. This is how these people think. Also, according to studies, how schizophrenics think. As they also like repeating patterns of thought."
The girl in the Malcom X shirt is the brightest one in the bunch and seems to be open to real conversation.  Kudos to her.
"Charlie is EXACTLY correct on affirmative action!  I have been passed over for promotions and job positions in MANY instances because I&#39;m WHITE!  Idiots going to college haven&#39;t even entered the &quot;working&quot; word and have ZERO experience on the matter!  Try passing testing for CHP, Sheriffs Dept. and being on jobs with  longer employment time and qualifications and getting passed over for someone less qualified, just because they are of their &quot;color&quot;!   The best qualified for the job, regardless of skin color or ethnicity, should be the standard, otherwise you have safety problems and rogue authority like police that should never be police!  Being 62, I have experienced it A LOT!"
Life is going to be tough for this girl when reality crashes into her world view.
So if an unborn baby isn’t yet a human life why are people charged with two counts of homicide if they murder a pregnant woman?
The sheer level of arrogant righteousness while displaying staggering ignorance is almost beyond comprehension. This is what college indoctrination does.<br><br>Note that they are the ones calling him names also.
It makes me sad that we will have to wait so long for Charlie Kirk to be president.
"Funny how she argues against subjective truth, and then proceeds to invoke her own subjective truths"
I have to admire Charlie Kirk for putting himself out there to debate and educate.
Charlie’s a stand up guy for sure <br>Standing up to these idiots
"&quot;Thousands of decades.&quot;<br><br>She&#39;s so passionate about her argument, that she&#39;s even willing to go as far back as B.C."
For real ?<br>What is a soul? <br>This generation is LOST.
The woman in the front with the malcom x shirt was actually engaging in a civil discussion. I actually respect her in this. Dont agree with her stances but she spoke and allowed others to speak and she even told people on her side off when they were wrong.
I admire Charlie for putting up with the stupidity he faces with these indoctrinated kids!  Bravo Charlie.
The young black lady actually gave me the impression that she might even be willing to have a thoughtful and truthful discussion about the nuances of historic racial issues if not for the other exhaustingly immature and misinformed young people around her. Maybe just a couple more years on her would help but good for her. Good for you young lady. At least youre thinking about this stuff critically and even asking questions still
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=256"">4:16</a> - &quot;It&#39;s called a statistic ...&quot;<br><br>I love the crowd&#39;s realisation of Kirk&#39;s simple and logical answers"
The white girl was annoying....the black girl came in with some knowledge and was open to a discussion n willingness to learn. 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
“Please don’t interrupt me” is the slogan for today’s youth.
"There is no such thing as “your truth” or “my truth”.  There is only the truth.  The truth doesn’t care about your feelings or emotions, nor is it based on those."
Each generation is becoming less intelligent than the previous generation.
"If that was my daughter, I would be so embarrassed and deeply ashamed. Spoiled brat. Disrespectful!"
its unreal how patient charlie is lmao
His patience with these insufferable brats is admirable.
Why do you have to lie about a woman almost dying?
"She really shows her intellectualism, and why we should pay off her college debt. I&#39;m glad my 21 year old son was smart enough to buy 9 acres of land instead of getting her level of education."
Heartbreaking. The near hysteria and confusion of these kids is so incredibly sad. Keep up the good work Charlie.
I love when they ask a question and then immediately follow up with &quot;Don&#39;t interrupt me&quot; when the person tries to answer it.
"Everyone rapid firing at Charlie and he takes it with openness and willingness to engage and have an actual conversation. It’s too bad that once these assholes are proven wrong, then they try to talk over him and when he takes a second to pause and collect his thoughts when asked a question, they immediately try to discredit him and tell him he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. This, ladies and gentlemen, is what bigotry truly looks like. That is a double standard. “I can spew whatever bullshit I want without any sources or facts, and that’s okay. But you have to answer our questions immediately without gathering your thoughts, or you’re lying.” Look at all the people surrounding him and look at the smug or hateful looks on their faces. They aren’t there to be taught or have an open discussion, they’re there so that they can defend their fragile egos and misguided information on political topics. I’ve never seen so many close-minded people attacking someone for stating facts. They want to jump down his throat without having any evidence or sources to backup their outlandish claims. I’m glad Charlie stands his ground and carries himself with such respect and believes in what he’s trying to do. Educate America"
First girl: “everything is subjective but there is a right or wrong” 🤡🤡
"I&#39;m &#39;Black&#39;, I&#39;m &#39;African American&#39;, racism, etc., etc. So tired of this being used to deflect from what the real issue/discussion is. So tired of everything always ending up back to racism. These young persons need to educate themselves more. Everyone is looking for a &quot;I gotcha!&quot; moment with Charlie. They&#39;re never prepared🙄"
It’s truly terrifying how poisoned  these kids minds are.
&quot;I&#39;ve noticed that everyone who is for abortion has already been born.&quot; -- Ronald Reagan
The smug looks on each of their faces despite being completely empty in the head is wild
“Why do people go to prison? Because they commit crimes” you baffled them with logic😂
Imagine being so triggered at the word &#39;Blacks&#39;....tell me again about that fragility 🤫
That blonde hair girl is super rude and dismissive! Well done charlie for answering their questions and giving them facts that must have been a hard pill to swallow for some of them! If i was those kids parents I&#39;d ask for my money back because the education system has failed to teach them something thats called &quot;facts &amp; truth&quot;
The blonde girls &quot;poor white people&quot; gets me everytime
"When the blonde girl said white man has ruled this country for thousands of decades, I think that gives you a glimpse of what level of intelligence we&#39;re dealing with here."
That girl with the X on her shirt is actually willing to have a true debate and is intelligent. She was indoctrinated and I think after this she has woken to the reality and will really start to see things better. She has great potential for the future.
There is no “your truth” or “my truth”<br><br>So sick of hearing that. The word they’re looking for is “my opinion” or “your opinion”<br><br>Truth is just Truth.
"Best thing about these videos.. these kids ignorance will be immortalized on YouTube indefinitely. Every one of them would be wise to hide the fact from their forward, that they ever spoke to Charlie Kirk in public😂"
"Whenever someone says, &quot;my truth&quot;  then it&#39;s obvious they are scared of thinking straight."
Charlie you are a BOSS! The way you can debate all of this logically and calmly is so amazing. Thank you for your service!
I went to high school in the late 90s. And we never talked about racism. We didn&#39;t talk about hating each other. Because the color of our skin. We didn&#39;t talk about racism. in society. And now it&#39;s back at full-blown. Racism&#39;s never gonna die as long as we keep bringing it up as long as skin color matters and it shouldn&#39;t matter at all.
"Obviously, it is the Karen in the middle keeping race baiting alive."
I love how the children today TRULY believe they know everything.
I want a refund on college loan forgiveness. My money was objectively wasted.
No amount of evidence would ever convince an idiot
"Makes me laugh that people refer to black people as African Americans, how many African born Americans are there in the USA? probably very few, if you&#39;re born in America then you are american, being specific about race then yes, blacks, whites, why people get so triggered by that is crazy, all these young black men aren&#39;t African, they&#39;re born in the US."
“It’s called a statistic” 🙄
The blond girl holding her hand up like shes in class has me DYING
Charlie has the best answers for these questions!!
I live vicariously through Charlie Kirk . He says everything that I wish I could say to people . <br><br>It&#39;s true what they say .... &quot; not all heroes wear capes &quot;
Charlie Kirk gets so much credit for trying to deal with these entitled children!
I applaud Kirk for being able to handle the ignorance of these young folks. I couldn&#39;t do it.
When I was in 5th grade we were way more intelligent and smarter as a age group at 11 and 12 than these kids are in college today and they are 18 to 23 or 24.<br><br>It&#39;s insane how extremely dumbed down our schools have made children in the last 15 years alone.
I&#39;m so scared for these young lost children
If a fetus is not alive then why do you have to kill it..?
I have huge respect for the girl in the Malcolm X shirt. She heard facts that she had not considered before and said the magic words: &quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; The majority of these young people would do just fine if they hadn&#39;t been brainwashed with lies for their entire lives. I would guess that most of them are not stupid. They just believe so many things that aren&#39;t true because no authority figure has ever told them anything else.
&quot;Don&#39;t interrupt me...I don&#39;t want to hear it&quot;. That&#39;s all that needs to be said.
I was waiting for the part of &quot;woman almost dies&quot; after learning what accountability is...where is that part?
She said &quot;more people going to jail for &quot;committing crimes&quot; as if thhat is a BAD THING!!!    Jail is exactly where they belong!!!
These “educated kids” are an example that feelings are being taught over facts
"I actually think there&#39;s hope for the girl in the Malcolm X shirt. She seems smart and interested in learning, though I worry that her eagerness to understand could be overshadowed by the expectations of her peers. She was certainly the most intelligent among the dissenters. I hope she learns to stop trusting the people and information she&#39;s been programmed to trust. I think she could actually go very far in life if she lets go of what she&#39;s expected to believe."
They don’t know who Thomas Sowell is 😭😩
Well done for keeping your temper with these rude ignorant children.  Thomas Sowell should be required reading.
"When someone says my truth and your truth, they have lost the argument."
The blonde isn’t listening she just wants to talk .
these babies are brainwashed
God bless you Charlie for helping this generation remove their blinders from what they&#39;ve been told and perhaps have a better vision to see the bigger picture.
The girl with the Malcom X tee is by far the brightest student there. She has the potential to have a great future.
"It&#39;s amazing that the young black lady and the Asian gentleman both quietly agreed with points Charlie raised,  and seemed to be the only ones who actually wanted to hear him out. The blond girl is going to be an angry victim for her whole life, the other two are much more likely to re-examine what he said and change their opinions as they move forward."
Double digit IQ’s all round! How Charlie keeps his cool is beyond me! Thank you for what you do Charlie! You’re awesome!
&quot;Who has the most abortions?&quot;<br>&quot;Women ...&quot; <br>Damn girl you definitely won that argument 😂
Much respect to Charlie for his tireless work with these lost children. I can&#39;t listen to these brats longer than 3 minutes.
These kids aren&#39;t evil. They are a reflection of the garbage being taught to them bt their woke professors.
Wtf are they teaching in school? Look in their eyes... the lights are off.
The worse people pretending to be the best is soooo sickening.
"The small black girl was really trying to have a discussion and prepared to listen. Fantastic. This should be repeated, there is hope."
"Charlie, THANK YOU for having the courage and strength to go into the lions den. You are making real change."
"&quot;Woman Almost Dies After Learning What Accountability Is&quot;<br>where does this happen here? watched it twice, couldn&#39;t find it.<br>Charlie has a huge number of great videos, but hyperbolic clickbait titles cheapen his presence here on youtube. He doesn&#39;t need those. He&#39;s great as he is."
"the guy on the left, trying to define affirmative action, was going to get absolutely embarrassed.  Charlie did him a huge favor by just dismissing the nonsense he was already spewing."
"I like the young black lady that talked the most. Very smart, down to earth and not brainwashed.  She listened to kirk, agreed and disagreed. Good woman"
The blonde girl is annoying. She is trying to defend something without information. exhausting.
"Imagine wearing a Malcom X shirt, but knowing absolutely Nothing about the guy. Just Wow"
These people don’t know how to not react when they disagree. They can’t answer one question. They listen to respond not to listen. They cannot have a conversation they only know how to speak over the person when they are trying to answer their question. They come with opinion and emotion and not reason and fact. Charlie Kirk is a G for being able to stay calm and hold multiple conversations at once.
The guy calls him an idiot and the proceeds to say  that he is not being respectful. What ???????????
"I really admire Mr. Kirk’s confidence, intelligence, courage, and ability to articulate his thoughts and ideas so quickly and precisely."
The truth is NOT subjective. Its absolute. By definition.
Props to the young black lady for knowing her stuff and for being open to hearing what Charlie is saying!
&quot;Who has the most abortions in America ?&quot;<br>&quot;Huh wOmeN ?&quot;<br><br>wow
"I respect the girl in the Malcolm X shirt for saying Charlie was right on a few things. That means shes open to both listen and talk, especially in that order."
"The young lady in the Malcolm x shirt was very well spoken and was able to have a great back and forth conversation. She is going places, and she truly seemed open minded. That’s the only way this conversation works. I also liked that charlie kirk said he was willing to learn and would be willing to change an opinion based on the facts he has."
These kids are so bigoted.  Our nation was so much more unified a couple decades ago.
these so called students wasting money to be waterboarded versus taking valuable classes .
How can young black college students not have heard of Thomas Sewell. He is one of the most brilliant speakers out there
"What charlie said about affirmative action lowering standards is so true. We&#39;re seeing it in action today. There is a situation in a state where black social workers were not passing the social worker test so they&#39;re talking about doing away with the test so that more black people can become social workers. That means that any standards that  you used to have to meet are no longer in place. It&#39;s honestly the worst thing that could happen to our country. I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re white and black brown, if you can&#39;t pass the preliminary test then you don&#39;t get in. It means you don&#39;t meet the qualifications or standard set."
i cant help but cry a little inside when people say &quot;my truth&quot; or &quot;your truth&quot;... those people clearly have never learned what the word truth means.  very obvious these college kids haven&#39;t done any homework.
How are these people who can barely articulate a coherent thought in these Ivy League Universities.
"The female that had blond hair and many other punks that sat around just trying to look cool and insult Charlie really made themselves look the fool, sad state in our colleges, not sure what happened, these young people need a course in common sense and decision making, attacking the speaker for giving you true information is dumb, learning is worth its weight in gold!"
The way they rely on eachother for any reaction speaks louder than their debate skills
"In 1966 I took the NYPD entrance exam at 16 years old, at the behest of my uncle who was in the NYPD,  as a fall back to college entrance.  I got a 92 on the exam but was told I had a low chance of entering the NYPD because &#39;minority&#39; applicants were given a 25 point addition to their score to help equalize past discrimination.  That meant that all minority applicants with a 68 or higher would outscore me and be hired before me. I accepted that and went on to complete a 4 year degree program."
"The level of disrespect is crazy. Our society has fallen way off. When we were their ages, we couldn&#39;t even dream of speaking to an adult in this manor without an ass whoppin."
Bro called him an idiot and then complains he was disrespectful despite not having insulted anyone once. Fallacy confirmed.
That young black lady had the most sense to have a civil discourse . Well done by both sides. We need more of these discussions amongst young people.
"&quot;Everything is subject....&quot; Okay, 1 + 1 does not equal 2. It can equal whatever we want it to at the time."
"I hate to hear a college student, especially a black woman, not know who Thomas Sowell is, though it isn&#39;t surprising that she has heard of Malcolm X"
"College students not knowing who is Thomas Sowell, is a tragedy and speaks volumes as to why we are in the current condition on campuses across the country. Not know what a soul is, is also gross."
I am only 33 years old but can say I hate this young generation. They are so rude
Blonde girl looked like her head was about to explode several times during the video when the black girl actually conceded some of Charlie’s points 🤣
"The kid on the left who said to Charlie, “Wrong, you’re an idiot…” was the idiot.  I’m so glad Charlie ignored him and just spoke to the other students."
"&quot;Of course racism still exists. The democrat party is alive and well.&quot; <br>Classic, Charlie!😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=305"">5:05</a> I love the fact that this black kid asked Kirk a question (even tho he was interrupting the conversation he had with the girl) and when he answered he pointed at him and said &quot;WRONG! You&#39;re an IDIOT!&quot; (also earlier he gave him the middle finger) and couldn&#39;t elaborate further - he just wanted to insult him - and 10 seconds later he has the audacity to say to another guy that Charlie isn&#39;t being respectful! <br>What a &quot;bright&quot; mind. Most of them are brainwashed to be idiots."
Allthe defensive posture-arms crossed in front
ITS NOT IGNORANCE  .these are evil beings.
"This guy has balls of steel,taking on the masses &#39;alone&#39; all the time."
"Charlie has an incredible amount of self control and understanding. To be able to put up with these ignorant, brainwashed, weak minded morons days on end is a strength beyond any other."
It’s sad Kirk using the word “blacks” elicited such a response from the children.
Charlie is a warrior against the war on ignorance.  I have no idea how he does it.  I wouldn&#39;t have the patience.
Kudos to the young lady who tried to engage in conversation. This is how we move forward.
First woman was doing exactly  what she was accusing him of.
"Irish and Italians were heavily discriminated in this country, where are their movements and “rights”?."
Just think how much more productive these kids lives would be if they actually spent more time studying the truth at college.
I’m not black and I know who Thomas Sowell is!  One of the most intelligent men and I love listening to him.  And that is one of the problems of the young black community that esteems Jay-Z and Lebron more than anyone.
"You can&#39;t argue with stupidity and ignorance, which they ignore 🙄"
He normally is right I’m sorry colleges failed u I got more common sense in my left pinky toe then a bunch of college grads it’s quite sad
"How is it.... You&#39;re in college, but yet you think the country you were born in was founded thousands of decades ago?!!?!"
It’s crazy for a guy that didn’t go to college can teach these kids more than their professors ever will.
This generation doesn&#39;t want to take responsibility for anything.
Arguing with a fool makes two fools.
"this guy... so calm, debates beautifully."
These kids don’t knows who Thomas Sowell  sad
"That young black girl was shockingly pleasant. She didn&#39;t belittle, didn&#39;t name call, didn&#39;t interrupt, and still got her points across. Wish more young people could be like her where even though they disagree they are open-minded in a conversation. Hopefully she continues down the same path of being patient, open-minded, and willing to learn/hear other people&#39;s point of view&#39;s. Respect to her and the way she handled herself."
I believe nothing is actually subjective everyone is equally wrong and right at the same time. Which means forgiveness must always come after action
I love that these people are paying for a degree and have zero concept of reality. <br>Our education system is failing them.
The girl with the Malcom X shirt has potential. She should leave this crowd behind.
That young ladies (Malcolm X shirt) engagement was a blessing to the conversation. Her discussion allowed everyone to hear an actual discussion and hearing Malcolm X was prolife shocked a few students.
You have to remember that he’s talking to children. Last year the kids were still in high school.
Orange shirt dude is ZONED out on that lollipop. 😂
"The girl in the Malcolm X T Shirt was very sensible and open to debate, the blonde girl thought she had loads of &quot;I Got Yur&quot; questions but just reveled her own ignorance and lack of common sense."
"Never stop doing what you’re doing, Charlie."
I realize that these young &quot;adults&quot; don&#39;t know much about the world they live in as they just haven&#39;t been alive long enough to know better ... but this group is &quot;special&quot;
The young black lady had a nice intellectual interaction but the rest was an absolute mess. They want to shout people down and there point is valid   But it’s completely invalid
“Nope don’t interrupt me I don’t want to hear it” as she states the same point she made a minute ago like a broken record.
Charlie collectively is the smartest person at that school.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=202"">3:22</a> “I feel like” that’s the issue with the arguments from a lot of these college kids. It’s always an argument based on feeling."
He said &quot;BLACKS&quot; and they lost their minds
Im not sending my kid to college
"Without even having to take a side here I can point out the huge problem this girl is having... She criticizes this man saying what makes his opinion greater than anyone else&#39;s, but then tries to assert that her opinion is greater than his. I&#39;m surprised this wasn&#39;t called out."
Its interesting how certain these college kids are about certain issues just repeating the group opinions that they have learned will be acceptable in the circles that they mix in without doing any deep thinking or research to back up their opinions it shows what a terrible job the education system is doing.
"If a doctor has to take a baby out of a woman prematurely, the baby is now considered by all sides a baby.  When is it not considered a baby?  These people that believe that its ok to abort a baby are ridiculous!  Babies are babies when God brings two people together and He forms one from them.  That&#39;s at conception.  They need to read the word."
Do ANY of these students know that &quot;their&quot; attachment country (Africa) SOLD THE WEAKEST OF THEIR PEOPLE for weapons??? If &quot;their&quot; country would not have SOLD their own people for weapons...this entire conversation would be so very different.  If it were me; I would not embrace that country and embrace America because America is their country along with the other citizens of this country.  They need a real history lesson before having these in depth discussions.
"It would be nice if a well prepared, polite, well read, intelligent student stepped up for once."
"Charlie is brilliant. He just gave these college zombies the best lesson in rational thought they&#39;ve ever had, and all for free."
"This blonde girl will someday turn 44, look around and realize that she has no real friends or a rewarding personal relationship;  but she will have 6 cats - with one of them just having vomited up the nose ring she lost the week before . . . ."
"The most intelligent young mind was shut down by her peers because they didn&#39;t have the attention span to listen to solid words being spoken. I feel like everyone in the audience was just looking for a &quot;gotcha&quot; moment where they could find offence, rather than dig deeper, which really stifles good debating."
You can tell this is the only difference of opinion these students ever hear.
"About the young black lady, wearing glasses and a Malcolm X t-shirt:  she is a little too adamant with her multiple truths assertions.  Otherwise, she has her thoughts mostly in order and appears to respond properly to view elements that make sense - logic and reason.  She is a perfect example of someone who will very likely realize one day, at an instant, that it is conservative values that align much more with her own ideas and principles, and that the liberal propaganda she has been inundated by her entire life have been from sources that work against the best interest of people like her, a black woman living in America."
Young woman in the Malcom X shirt is finding truth. Good for her. I think she understood the point here. Growth. Kudos to you for having a real conversation young lady. ❤keep pressing and being real and society will continue to move forward because of people like you.
She really piped down when he used Malcolm X&#39;s own words to counter her position.  She had no where to go after that.
“Everything is subjective.” She states as an objective truth.
"“We’re a different race so, you wouldn’t understand”, says the racist complaining about racism"
These college professors have to be held responsible and so do these leftist...
"I like this women with the braid and the glasses and Malcom X shirt. She seems like she&#39;s really having a conversation. She&#39;s willing to concede when something is true, and still holds her ground. I wish great things for her."
Do you believe back on back crime is a thing? <br><br>Do you know how many people died in Chicago 4th of July weekend? Yeah its real lol
"Charlie, your ability to handle a crowd is admirable."
"When I was a college student, I was encouraged to more listening than talking."
He’s patient and they started listening. Well done. Charlie is well-educated.
When she said you can&#39;t be racist to white people she instantly lost the conversation.
&quot;Everything is subjective&quot;....one of the biggest lies ever told. A moral shield for cowards to hide behind when they are too scared to take a stand on something .
"Thank you, Charlie Kirk for continuing to speak the truth, open dialogue, and educate these poor misinformed kids."
I&#39;m not gonna lie I got a lot of respect for that black girl with the braids who was communicating with Kirk during this video. She acknowledged facts and despite her disagreements she still kept it calm.
How can you stay cool &amp; collected in the face of so much stupidity &amp; stubbornness?
Nothing but huge respect for Mr. Kirk. ❤
"I never imagined a world where kids were not only giving their souls away, but they never believed that they had one to begin with... this is terrifying."
"This is not a conversation, they are just fishing for an opinion to get you cancelled."
"That young woman with the glasses and bleached braids offered more to the conversation than everyone else in that debate with Charlie Kirk. Man, I wish more people could have conversations like that."
listening to her talk was difficult... imagine having her as a coworker... or your HR manager... ugh
These kids have this obsession with trying to belittle anyone who disagrees with them
&quot;that you have entire movements  dedicated to your race?&quot; that shut her up real quick
"This conversation is terrifying on so many levels, you can literally hear the indoctrination coming out of their mouths."
The woman who tells Charlie that he has no right to make decisions about her life is defending the right to terminate another human being&#39;s life. Ironic doesn&#39;t even describe how contradictory her thought process is
It’s hard not to think we are doomed after watching these videos.
"The girl with the glasses in front is a good debater, she is staying calm and having  and communicating in a sensible way."
&quot;eeeeuurr its call a statistic&quot; 🙃says the women that doesn&#39;t believe in facts or truth. What is college teaching these kids?
"You can tell that blonde chick has never been told no her entire life. The young black lady, however seemed willing to learn and have a spirited debate so I commend her for that. We need more young people like that. I disagree with a decent portion of her thought process, but at least she&#39;s willing to talk about it."
That blonde girl will go far working at WalMart
"He&#39;s a good teacher, and a good man. Patience is a virtue"
Damn that white guy with the long blond hair had attitude. He also had no point. He and his brother should just stick to performing that song more than words.
17 years in law enforcement and I never arrested anyone unless I had probable cause to believe they had committed a crime. The idea that law enforcement caused the increase in crime is laughable and absurd.
That&#39;s why I don&#39;t argue opinions. I argue from a position of understanding truth.
These kids learned more from 10 minutes with Charlie than they&#39;ll learn in all their years at college. Keep up the deprogramming!
Ok so one gal seems to think its bad the crooks get caught like the crime didnt happen if they dont get caught ....doofus smh
What a VERY patient person you are Charlie. I applaud you.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=232"">3:52</a> I actually applaud her for admitting that.  You can see it on her face as it slowly dawns on her.  She has been so used to never having someone question her about the talking points, when someone finally did, she paused and you can see for a moment, she thought about it and had no rebuttal! 😀"
Is murder wrong?<br>&quot;Not in every case.&quot; <br><br>WTF? Does she not know what murder is???
Charlie should get a medal for putting up with this stupidity on a volunteer basis 😂.
This black girl is smart and intelligent. Willing to have a grown up debate. Good on her👏👏👏
There&#39;s no &quot;my truth.&quot; There&#39;s only personal experience and interpretation of that experience.
"@Charlie Kirk  I appreciate you going to college campuses to have these kind of discussions.  You handle yourself so well, with these students!  <br>You show that you sincerely care about these students.  You listen patiently and respectfully.  ❤"
I wish I was a teenager again. They know SO much more than everyone else.🙄
"I find it interesting that when you engage a group of people of that age you&#39;re actually engaging what they have been taught by their upbringing and you can tell how little they have done as independent agents of their own lives.<br><br>When you think about it, it&#39;s a difficult task for anyone to engage that audience regardless of their reason or logic."
I&#39;d love to know how these young women would console each other if they miscarried a baby that they wanted. I guarantee they won&#39;t be so flippant if they&#39;re unfortunate enough to lose a much wanted baby.
I’ve been convinced one of the first things college students learn is how to be extremely smug and repulsively rude in their ignorance.
This is way this country is in trouble so out of touch with reality.
I love this interaction because no one flipped out and the students kept talking rather than walk away pissed off. Great job to Charlie Kirk and these young people!
Young people no experience in life.
"That girl was debating, but she was being very respectful in general of trying to debate rather than argue random stuff."
It’s funny how once kids get out of high school and aren’t living with mommy and daddy anymore and are now living out on their own while still not having to pay bills think they know everything about the world 😂
the PATIENCE Charlie has is amazing.  It&#39;s so difficult to rationalize with irrational people
Every one of them immediately tried to belittle Charlie and call him an idiot every time they brought up their point they wanted to talk about.  I don&#39;t know how he remains so calm and collected in situations like that.
I respect anyone who can remain patient like this.
Amazing how the more ignorant these students are the more rude they are.
i have listened to 1 minutes and 19 seconds of this and her self-contradiction is already causing me physical pain. you are a saint charlie.
Excellent work once again Charlie!! Thank you for telling the facts to these under educated kids
"And just like Flat Earthers, they are asking really great questions but they don&#39;t want to hear the answer. They think that the question itself is an argument."
The sass when they think they are right is the funniest shit ever
I think it’s awesome these kids warmed up to you enough to have constructive discussion
"“Why do people go to prison, they commit crimes.”"
Charlie you got big balls dealing with this generation. Keep teaching them.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=243"">4:03</a> what os she on about? Does she not think white people can experience racism?"
we gotta respect the girl w the M.X. shirt. she was one of VERY few ppl who actually admitted it when charlie was right
The biggest decision these kids have daily is whst they are having for lunch
Justice to the guy who was raising his hand patiently the whole time even AFTER you called on him and he started to talk. These entitled people in the front wanted all the attention.
How do you go to college and end up being dumber?
"College students are just exhausting man. I remember thinking I knew everything in my early 20&#39;s too, but we are reaching new heights.  I grew up in California and every single teacher/professor was extremely liberal, and had no problem letting their political views seep into the classroom. They don&#39;t even realize they are being brainwashed. You have to grow out of it."
"Just because its YOUR truth from YOUR beliefs, doesn`t mean its THE truth.<br>A LOT of people need to understand this."
Kudos to the girl in the Malcolm X shirt. She was willing to have an open and civilized discussion with Charlie and to listen instead of just screaming at him. Well done to her.
Charlie I have to give it to you for standing up to these young people. Kudos to you.
Imagine calling someone who is 100x smarter than you an idiot.. lol.. these kids live in a fantasy world of make believe lol.. astonishing.
Cheers to the young black woman for keeping her composure in a debatable topic. Cheers to her and her attitude
Charlie Kirk you saved my life. God bless you.
Takes a lot of courage to do what Charlie is doing....and love for these young people.  Praying for you Charlie!
"These kids have no clue that adult conservatives once held the exact views and passions they have now. As you live, experience, and gain wisdom you realize how ignorant, uneducated, and trapped in a bubble you have to be to speak pretending you know what you&#39;re talking about."
Are these people seriously expecting to be employable when they finish college?
It&#39;s always amazing to me how those with minimal REAL LIFE experience always think they know more than those who have actually lived REAL LIFE for many decades.
"The real question is, why does she believe that her morals go above everybody else’s morals?<br><br>After all, if everything is subjective, then what makes you right <br><br>Why just because"
"Total respect for Malcom X chic trying to have an intelligent, productive conversation. 👍"
I&#39;m losing faith in the intelligence of our youth in this nation!!
I can prove an unborn child has feelings and thinks. As a fire fighter for 40 years I had a woman that was in an accident and had most her head crushed. She was 8 months pregnant and if you saw how hard that baby fought to survive you would know that it’s alive! Unfortunately the baby died before we got her out of the car.
“There is no such thing as objective or absolute truth” is an objective statement of absolute truth and a paradox.
"As a Gen X&#39;er the rampant racism on campuses makes me angry, sad &amp; sick.<br>CRT/identity politics is poison."
Says “your an idiot” then says  Charley is disrespectful
"You are amazing with those kids, Charlie! I’m a retired high school teacher who really misses that interaction. You’re a good listener who allows them to speak and make their points, after which you set them straight! And I see some of the kids give you their sign of approval when you do that. We need more caring adults like you out there!"
God Bless you Charlie. I wish he was in charge of our educational system. You can learn a lot more in 5 minutes of talking to Charlie then you can after a year at certain schools.
All stuff aside I give Charlie mad credit for being brave and Patient enough to endure crowds like this month after month
Christ loves YOU and died for YOU on that cross🙏✝️
Charlie’s patience level is incredible. 😂😂
"And soon as they go the &quot;please don&#39;t interrupt me&quot; route, you know they have already lost"
Excellent
"Bruh, the black girl was trying to have a conversation while the white girl was trying to look good."
Car crash example an EXCELLENT way to debunk the &quot;personal truth&quot; trumping objective truth argument
They&#39;ve been failed by their educators.
"It’s not about what you feel, it’s about what is FACTS"
"He should have followed up with, &quot;is it a person an hour before they&#39;re born&quot;?"
His patience is a super power
Nobody thinks they are just &quot;right&quot; without any reasoning behind it.  Charlie Kirk gives--supporting reasons--behind every opinion that he makes.
He uses logic and facts based off of history and biology
Someone needs to red flag the girl who said murder isn’t wrong in every case. Put her on the FBI watchlist. 😂
Most of them have no clue. They follow the leader blindly
I love how KIDS with no life experience have it all figured out. The older I get the more I realize how much I don&#39;t know.
"Arguing with college age adults is just like arguing with pre teen kids. They KNOW everything, and you know nothing. As a parent of a 23 year old i have learned soooooooooo much from him..............."
Some of these kids are just educated incorrectly. Taught untrue “facts”.
"i know these are just children, but the fact they don&#39;t know who Tomas Sowell is, is astounding"
God bless you Charlie! These kids are intolerable and yet you patiently carry on the discussion
They don’t let him speak because they know he’s right
I look at it this way…if you were able to break thru to at least one of them it’s worth it. You at least educated them with real knowledge and understanding. I appreciate and admire your effort and your patriotism for our great nation. Thank you 🙏
Dude ..big props..this guy has the balls to go and site and debate/educate over and over
"Charlie is not only proactively educational but bold as dogs balls, one of these reactionary liberal sociopaths is going to present a real and present threat to his safety.  Legend"
This girl tried really hard to create an argument. I appreciate her effort.
There IS objective truth—it drives me nuts when people pretend otherwise
She wants to tell him what he thinks and wont allow him to interrupt... the hypocrisy of narcissism knows no end.
This younger generation scares the heck out of me. They think they are know-it-alls when they have barely started adulthood and lived life yet. Keep proving them wrong with the correct information and I can only pray they will one day be humbled.
They don’t believe in “souls” because they don’t possess one themselves!!!!!!
"Bravo to the young lady participating in a conversation with Charlie. I&#39;m sure because of her open mind, others learned something that day."
"Unreal, this was by far the WORST group of college kids I have ever seen Charlie have to deal with. Their lack of respect is simply disgusting, let alone their complete hypocrisy &amp; ignorance, and yet ALL these ENTITLED children preach about is how unfair the world is to them, at fvckin 18-22 years old IN COLLEGE. It&#39;s insane how much energy they put into playing the victim, that could be used so much more productively. Just further proof to exactly why America is going backwards."
"So sad, these kids have no idea what life really is, the fact that they don’t know when life starts, is mesmerizing!"
&quot;Professors&quot; need to be held accountable.
I think it’s amazing that they can have this dialogue. Props to all the kids who stood up and engaged with Charlie.  Debate is not hate.  Let’s keep this going.
Charlie is doing such a worthy job!❤
"Wearing a mask outside in 95% heat unfortunately shows how controlled many kids are,brainwashed by evil unfortunately.🙏"
"These are so hard for me to watch. I was raised to be respectful to others and intentional, continued disrespect was always handled swiftly and harshly and I carry that teaching with me to this day. He is absolutely built for this. Such a patient and humble man."
God bless you Charlie. Your patience when you are being rudely interrupted is stellar. True gentleman.
"Honestly,  I am sick of college girls talking so much."
1st year of college and these kids think they know everything and are self righteous
I remember being an undergrad student 12 yeara ago and having proper debates. How the times have changed.
He was right about everything I’m really impressed
"Charlie you have the energy, patience and calming, thank you 🙏🙏"
They need Candace Owens!
"Ive seen worse scrums but Charlie does such a good job of not escalating already hot and unstable passion and temperature. Hes a class act and very talented at what he does. Not to mention, brave. Respect, Mr Kirk ❤"
"The patience of Charlie Kirk is legendary.........listening to and debating, calmly,patiently and respectfully to societies most ignorant and ideologically brainwashed nihilists who dont even think they have a soul.  This is work that Christ himself could respect."
"The fact that she said &quot;Don&#39;t interrupt me, I don&#39;t want to hear it...&quot; says she was not prepared for an argument.  When will people start doing research and educate themselves before trying to debate political topics?"
Accountability is a bad word to liberals.
These kids are off their rockers. Great job parents! You should be sooooooo proud.
"I love seeing the longer version vids.  I’ve gotta give it to these kids for b n respectful, using their minds and listening. Charlie, you’re doing a great job by opening up the conversation, making kids use their brains and teaching them. You’re keeping their attn. Better than what most professors do. I applaud u! 👏👏"
&quot;Do not argue with a fool. He will drag you down to his level and beat you with experience.&quot;
If I were the parent of any of the students I would think I wasted my money sending them to college.
The most important thing these kids learned is that we are entitled our own opinions but not our own set of facts. There can ultimately be only 1 truth and that’s THE truth.
I am losing hope for today&#39;s youth.
Have they been educated ?<br><br>Or indoctrinated ?
You lost me at “Soul” brother… What’s a SOUL? 😂
She doesn’t know who Thomas Sowell is?!?!?! FFS 🤦🏻‍♂️
"&quot;But no, you&#39;re wrong, because I think that&#39;s right, and you think that&#39;s right&quot; Truly one of the most amazing and beautiful and intelligent and inspired quotes of all time"
"Truth, by its very definition, is objective. Once you introduce subjectivity into truth, it becomes perspective."
quit school at work at fast food
"The biggest issue here is that all of a sudden this entire crowd starts having way too many different arguments at the same time.  ...The dude is playing whack a mole, and that is not a discussion.  I also noticed the girl said, &quot;Don&#39;t interrupt me&quot;... because I want to say again, the exact same sentence I already said to you twice before. These people don&#39;t even hear &#39;themselves&#39;; inside their own minds, when they blabber, so how can we expect them to understand and accept LOGIC."
The stupidity of these students&#39; reasoning is incredible.
"I love this guy!! He never gets mad or upset, anyone who gets worked up he calms them down. He makes everyone comfortable"
Some people love to here themselves talk
"One unsung hero in this scene is the dude in the orange t-shirt and some of those holding conversations behind the scenes. As for the young woman in the Malcolm X shirt, she appears to have lived a sheltered life within a silo but definitely has got sense, respect, and the ability to reason through her newfound findings."
I would definitely watch an extended conversation between Charlie and the young woman in the Malcom X tshirt.  Two people who were able to keep emotion out of their debate which can inflame a lot of people.  Sign her up Charlie!
The TRUTH is NOT subjective. Period.
"she has to be high, its the only thing that makes sense about her body language"
"It&#39;s so frustrating that these, basically children have been empowered by their teachers, precession and society to believe they are the authority of knowledge when they haven&#39;t even lived in the real world yet."
He’s so good at what he does it’s crazy!
The question should be “what perpetuates racism?”
It’s nice watching the youths today get educated 😂
I appreciate that these students went from screaming and hollering to then listening
They tried to 6v1 him and talk over him and still managed to get absolutely crushed.
Charlie you’re a boss. I love that you have the courage to face the wokes in their face
Interrupts <br><br><b>Dnt interrupt me</b>
God bless Charlie Kirk for opening the eyes of the few that listen.
"I just love that you’re facilitating these types of conversations. It’s critical to exchange opinions and engage in debate—that’s how we reach legitimate conclusions.<br>What you’re doing is so important, thank you."
"This man has the patience of a saint. And due to this, he might actually get through to these kids."
Girl says don&#39;t interrupt me. Then interrupts everybody else.
Thank you for being so patient with these young people who have been trained to see every issue as oppressor and oppressed.
"‘Is murder wrong?’ <br><br>‘Yes, of course.’<br><br>Ma’am, you just stated a subjective opinion. If everything is subjective, there is no morality. There is no right or wrong.<br><br>Man I miss when our culture imbued basic moral philosophy. These kids are unbelievably confused and it’s not their fault, 1,000 opinions, 90% of them unsussed logic in every song, show, tik tok, peer and too many adults."
Short girl is there to learn other side. Blonde girl is there to win.
University of Texas in Austin of course it&#39;s Austin the California of Texas
"if a fetus is not a human, then why does a person get charged with a double homicide for killing a pregnant woman."
"Thank you, Charlie. You gave the naive college kids the right wake up call! They are smart, but do need to analyze more before open their mouth."
"I&#39;m not a pro-lifer, but it disturbs me how smug, lazy, and irrational some of my fellow pro-choicers can be. They enter into these debates with zero preparation and then get mad when they can&#39;t defend themselves."
A wise man once said: &quot;The biggest mistake humanity has ever made was to use science as a means to justify the division and classification of humanity based on race. ...&quot;
"one of the best discussions ever. no screaming, blaming... just a conversation."
Trying to educate ignorant people is just about pointless. I give this guy soooooo much credit for even trying to have these conversations with people who are anti-facts.
&quot;I don&#39;t believe in souls&quot; <br>So what are you fighting for? Who are you fighting for? Why should anything matter? It&#39;s just cells and matter.
Great Job Charlie -  so important discussions
And these people are going to be the future of America???! OMG
As soon as she said &quot;militarization of police&quot; she instantly lost all little intelligence she had left.
How does he stay so calm?  He is amazing that he talks to them as if they are equals when it is painfully clear that all they can do is spout pompous nonsense.
"i see 6 demons against a normal ,moral guy named charlie"
"I liked the young lady with the glasses. She was very respectful, very articulate. Everybody else was feeding off emotions with nothing much to say a value. Very good conversation between you and her."
"I so appreciate the young woman in the Malcolm X tshirt. She engaged in actual conversation,  didn&#39;t hurl nasty insults of she disagreed❤, and she made some decent points. I was definitely interested in hearing her thoughts. Well done. Great job as always, Charlie."
Girl between the age of 18 - 21 in college wearing a Malcom X shirt.  His movement was 40+ years before she was even born and she&#39;s going to act like she was &quot;in it&quot; with a solid grasp back in the early 1960&#39;s.  I can tell what kind of angry parents raised her.
Where’s part two
Poisoned brains
Horns down
Blonde girl is not eating it she pmo the entire video wanting to be in then mix so bad lol
Eternity is only in Christ…the soul is not eternal without Christ.
&quot;I think of a man.  And I take away reason and accountability.&quot;
They are eating the cats and dogs
"Objective is directive aka priority, it doesn&#39;t mean &quot;unquestionably true&quot; like you mouth-breathers pretend it means.<br>Objectives ate real but objective vs subjective is false dichotomy, the mind is fibite aka flawed or quantifisble not &quot;objective&quot; as in &quot;absolute&quot; but objective as in &quot;targets desired direction of progress.&quot;"
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=232"">3:52</a> when the black chick made the white chick question herself😂😂"
"What they don’t know is that every person creates their own truth based on their belief system. Someone’s truth can be that smoking cigarettes is healthy if their belief system supports that idea and another person’s truth can be that smoking cigarettes is deadly. Both can be right and both can experience a confirmation of their truth because their belief system is strong enough to support it no matter how different is for others. So, debating about whose truth is more truthful is NONSENSE because truth is subjective and can override collective truths. For example, if most of the people experience a certain situation in a certain way (this is how science creates studies and theories) there can be someone or even a few people who don’t experience the same results of the same situation simply because they have a very different belief rooted in their subconscious that don’t allow the “collective” truth to be. <br><br>We create our truth and it’s made out of our beliefs and our beliefs are made out of our experiences. <br><br>These guys are wasting their time. There is NOOO universal truth. <br><br>Humans can fly, humans can be invisible, humans can grow limbs. The only reason we haven’t seen any of these is because no human has managed to make any of these things part of their belief system but we will see it eventually"
And they all LOSE THEIR SH*T when he says &quot;blacks&quot; LMFAOOOO
"These people literally prove the saying, the empty can rattles the most."

"It is a <a href=""http://soul.is/"">soul.Is</a> your mind your will and your emotions. A spirit is your discernment your intuition And your communion. Is a body Is flesh blood and bones."
Tf she talkin bout “thousands of decades”? He’s had his truth since 8000 BC? Before the first civilization existed? When there were cavemen?
Most nicest liberal ever
Off topic but the guy in the CM Punk shirt earned my respect simply for his shirt 😂
"For some people, accountability is like kryptonite."
Soon as she said &quot;everything is subjective&quot; there&#39;s a problem
"wot a bunch of negative old dogs commenting...........<br>these students are a credit, opening their minds, forming opinions and disagreeing without being disagreeable."
"I’d ask those women this; What is higher, the amount of unlawful, innocent people in prison? Or the amount of unsolved crimes and missing people (specifically children)."
"How can he talk about facts when he reverts to the &quot;soul&quot; as something definitive?<br><br>Everybody with an ounce of intelligence knows that creationism, afterlife, spirits, God etc is nothing more than blind faith with absolutely no evidence to support it.<br><br><br>He ruins a perfectly valid argument by using his faith and making himself a hypocrite."
This generation be dizzy blood🤦🏾‍♂️🤣
"There are a lot of listeners, learning....the truth.....very good!"
These are college students? Man I’m scared for the future generations
The product of postmodernism is people with subjective understanding of what it is truth.
These kids have ZERO SELF CONTROL! Don’t they see that automatically makes them seem wrong if they can’t debate in peace
These entitled brats are spewing thier emotion filled Opinions...Charlie is stating Facts and truth....
"When did people become so stupid. There is only one reality and within that reality there is only one truth. You can have your opinions, beliefs and values but there is no, my truth and your truth, there is only the reality and the truth."
"I believe in law enforcement, not policy and feelings enforcement. Most police these days enforce policies that actually violate civil rights."
What&#39;s up with the gay guy on the far left?
I think I feel I think I feel I think I feel
These college students are getting  quite an education 😂
He is getting them to think for themselves.    Remember Giordano Bruno 1548 -1600   His fate was the main reason Galileo chose to recant his observations of the moons of Jupiter ... orbiting Jupiter.
"Charlie is a s1mp. The woman interrups him constantly, but he allows the woman to lecture HIM with &quot;don&#39;t interrupt me.&quot;"
Imagine humiliating yourself in front of 5 million people 😂😂😂😂
This is the result of Time Out Kids! Its like explaining colors to a blind person!!
Give the young black girl a scholarship
Don&#39;t bring religion into secular debates and you will be supported by all religions and atheists who share your position. I&#39;m disliking the current video for this reason.
"Im a catholic, I believe in the soul, but still, science havent prove without a trace off doubt that the soul exist and still I choose to believe because faith. We can say that soul exist, but its not an undisputable truth until its prove"
That white girl is exactly the type Malcolm X warned us about.
"“Why is it when the police got militarized, crime went up and more people went to prison?” Crime “went up” because they caught more of the people bro how do you not get it😭💀"
They say they don’t believe we have souls but also believe you can be a man trapped in a woman’s body? Make that make sense
"If you want a role model for accountability, you have Trump.  WoW!   After Nov 4, Trump supporters will be really depressed."
"The students LAST statement is superb :  &#39;Militarization of the police resulted in MORE  people being arrested for crimes &#39; Duuuuhhhh,  a logical person would  hope so.   Look at the  state of cities today,   NO Bail,  NO jail time =  INCREASED CRIME.  Please take a Logic course in college."
The ignorance and arrogance of these college students is both apparent and appalling.
THIS IS called civil dialogue. These college kids are future leaders. Nothin wrong in questioning?
"We pay for this . We pay taxes to teach young minds ,or warp their minds . I love when you said blacks ,and corrected them by BLM .LOVE IT .JESUS BLESS YOU 🙏"
Many talk show people  hold reign ABOVE others.
"Charlie, you should invite Larry Elder to go on campus tour with you. College kids should see more sane black voices like him talk. Thomas Sowell would be great but I doubt he wants to do it."
"If we’re having a civil discussion, agreeing or not, if you throw in “you’re an idiot, lemme tell you why” the conversation is OVER even if you have 37 valid reasons for your claim."
Surplus from the Army had to go somewhere....Police....
Why are they all looking for excuses fot things being bad. Instead of making them better.
Holy shit it&#39;s so funny watching the blonde
I wish I was young and dumb again. Experience robs you of that time when you genuinely believe that you understand everything. Treasure your moments of self admiration and intellectual superiority because lifes paths and realities will take this momentary bliss far away frim you.
Dude on the left wants respect but calls Charlie an idiot then calls the guy next to him and idiot for just asking him to let Charlie speak
@charliekirk Pleasee meet with the LDS missionaries I know you’ll love them and love having a conversation with them! :)
"So, why is it that they always start with the question, &quot;Is murder wrong&quot;? I&#39;ll tell you why, because most individuals with even the slightest empathy will answer yes. But why is it that the states that have pass the most restrictive abortions laws (even excluding rape and incest) all have the death penalty and are still using it? It&#39;s NOT about murder or pro-life it&#39;s about control!"
Check ✔️ ✅️ Check they are so blind of there privilege
"At one point when she messed up ( lied ) she said &quot;oh that&#39;s a bit embarrassing&quot;! Lol understatement of the past thousands of decades! The next generation are going to be traumatised by all the awful videos of their parent&#39;s hypocrisy, shame, and noody pics!!"
"Charlie I have enormous respect for your courage, knowledge of history, constitution, biblical principles and more. God definitely has gifted you with thick skin lol. God Bless you ."
These young students are so cringey
In the &#39;90s after the Bank of America North Hollywood bank robbery where the robbers had AK47s and out gunned the LAPD became militarized. After that squad cars and SWAT teams were outfitted with AR15s and other heavy weapons.
thomas soules &quot; who&quot; &quot; LBJ&quot; who ? not bill clinton who was &quot; el BJ&quot; the fact that these people knew no historical figures in the civil rights movement  but tried to school him was laughable
If all you have to ask is &quot;why do you think you&#39;re more right&quot; then you already lost
speculation vs facts
Crime went down in the 80s due to 2 things. <br>&quot;Nobody Says I want to be a junkie when I grow up&quot; <br>&quot;21 Jump Street&quot;
&quot;The crime rates drop because of abortions&quot; is hilarious
I REALLY want to sit down with (You) Charlie Kirk &amp; have an intelligent conversation ! I am tired of talking to STUPID people !
"Thomas Sowell is a national treasure and has opened my eyes. Milton Friedman too. Much of what Mr Kirk is teaching here is masterfully explained in their books and videos of interviews and debates. Thank you, Mr Kirk, for supporting their legacy of wisdom and fact-based teachings."
And these kids will be the future of this country?  They are so ignorance.
I say blacks because not everyone is African and not every one is American.
"Q: What&#39;s the definition of mass confusion?<br>A: Father&#39;s Day in Harlem.<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23factsmatter"">#FactsMatter</a>."
It’s so sad to see young people having their minds destroyed by the woke mind virus. I pray for my children daily.
These college kids are passive learners and seriously lacking critical thinking skills.  No one was able to bring up arguments backed by strong logic and facts.
"It&#39;s really sad that students don&#39;t know that 6% of slaves were owned by black business owners. That&#39;s 700,000 people that were enslaved by blacks. Of the 3.8 million slaves that shows that slavery was an economic element far more than a racial element. Slavery was first discovered in Portugal. The first black slaves were brought to South America for several hundred years prior to the English and US slave trade. Educate yourself BEFORE you start making ignorant statements and decisions."
The future of America doesn’t look good!!!
Doesn&#39;t she think her opinion is above his? Thats why they&#39;re called opinions.
"Lol she doesn&#39;t know who Thomas Sowell is the singlemost impressive black intellectual mind in the world... yes cleverer  than Morgan Freeman! I have read most of his books I am white, male, British and over 50!"
"Ask, why do believe race is an issue? Answer...because you were taught it is."
All immature children (oh btw ppl are tryna say hes abusive (kirk or wtv his name is) and cancel him
This is what happens when you&#39;re so woke you haven&#39;t slept.<br><br>Truth is no amount of WOKE can fix issues that actually matters
"Charly, you are right, but  you need help explaining spiritual points.   I could use Rosie much better when she asked about “soul”.  Anyways… Tnx. Charly."
God I’m so tired of this ridiculous BS…. But I still keep watching 😂😂😂
when are you running for President bro?
I was taking a test for the Chicago Police Department in 1988 at Lane Tech high school They had given me the wrong test and I asked them what the wrong test was and they said this is a test for minorities. I asked them what the difference was they replied by say it was an easier test and not as complicated!!<br>1988!!!!
&quot;We are not rich duh...&quot;<br>you all are! all student are poor! you only get rich when you earn your own money...<br>those kids you call rich are just spoild brats!
"Yes, Charlie, there is an objective reality - and based on what we know about it, there is no soul."
"why did the black guy with dreads call Charlie stupid? that is so uncalled for. Charlie knows a lot, and learns a lot.. he should be learning from him, instead of insulting him."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=160"">2:40</a> Wow Charlie, the hypocrisy. Now talking about the murder rates in other races is racist? So convenient indeed. That was a very cheap shot and red herring. We don&#39;t know if there is such a thing as a &quot;soul&quot;, let alone what it is. Lacking the humility to admit that doesn&#39;t put at you a better position (the argument from ignorance fallacy)."
"Crime rates (especially violent crime) grew sharply in the late 60s-70s in mainly urban areas w/ high no. of black people.  It was the result of economic disinvestment, unemployment, the heroin epidemic, and rising tensions between communities and law enforcement."
The Soul is the nonvisible being that comes out of your body after DNA is completely destroyed.  My gosh!  Where do they learn this spooky stuff?
Was that black girl with a face mask expecting to hear something other than the simple truth? 😂😂😂
The country is doomed if this continues
I salute every conservative who attends College... I wouldn&#39;t be able to take these nutjobs
"She kept asking why does his opinion trump others...well it doesnt, but that implies others opinions could or should trump his if not worded correctly. I dont think she knows what shes trying to get at.<br><br>I get it, shes poor at debates because doesnt have rhe wxperience, but thening specifically to a prochoice argument just gets off track. I wish charlie instead steered the conversation toward the measurable effects of opinions and choices, rhats more foindationally coherent and easier to defend than to go in circles over voccabulary.<br><br>At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=180"">3:00</a> im reminded of a diffrrent video where a man supported not displaying publicly, certain types of statistics, because he didnt want racists to have the tools to draw certain inferences. Thats a horrible justification, because it says to me that ppl dont have the privlesge to be wrong, have their ideas challanged or minds changed of it risks upsetting somelne else. Unfortunately that is the very core of discussion and debate. Those are the only tools we as a civilisted culture have to parse ideas without violence. So dayong or implying that you cant risk making someone uncomfortable whule commuiicating with them, kinda also means you support the use of violence in some way to force change, over debate. <br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=590"">9:50</a> that&#39;s just a bitchy thing to say, its not even a point. They changed the subject, then get uppity when je stated he doesnt know about that particular thing? Charlie is wrong here however, more heavily equipping police as a reaumt to rhe 70&#39;s crime wave, didnt militarise the police as she&#39;s likely talking about, that happened in the eaely 90&#39;s after a single broadcast of a back robbery that used AR&#39;s. There was a heavy push by manufacturers to expand into the police as a market, as well as expanding legislation and removing accountability features that favoured police. Then 9/11 happened and suddenly every police station needed to be equipped with anti terrorism policies, that were used predominately on non terror suspects. Imagine in 2004, watching your local police station drilling on how to handle a biological attack in a home depot parking lot, of a town with a population or 25,000. I dont rhink charlie would be so pro police after he hears about qualified immunity,  civil asset forfeiture, and how rhey pushed to keep feild tests are known to a 50% accuracy rate."
There was nothing in this about accountability... At all...
Lol he&#39;s smart until it comes to his bullcrap religion. &quot;What is a soul&quot; .. he couldn&#39;t answer that 😅
the name calling like little kids is absolutely wildddddd. they shouldn&#39;t be able to vote
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1By2RyqFgA&amp;t=346"">5:46</a>. There&#39;s only one race miss. N that&#39;s the human race.  Duh!! Racist much??"
"Its quite obvious, SHE thinks her opinion, is better than another persons opinion, because DADDY says she is a good girl and she is right."
"Everything is subjective<br>Math, Physics, especially Biology teachers what the hell you re teaching your students? 1+1=11 is correct because your student think so?"

Good to get a glimpse of the future of America. White girl looking like the future lawyer for the BLM movement. Note to BLM You can do much better!
"I’m not Republican I’m not Democratic but I do know this shit isn’t helpful at all. Like, setting up dead end debates between people who have already previously decided they can’t be convinced otherwise. That’s the shit I’m referring to, left, right, or otherwise"
Why do i torture myself with these videos
"&quot;No matter what my candidate does, I&#39;ll still vote for them&quot; is a crazy statement"
Political videos are like crack once you start watching you can&#39;t stop.
"Wait, why did the moderator just single out the black woman and say he can&#39;t include the clips of her &quot;yelling over people&quot; when everyone else was literally doing the same thing? Uhh macroaggression much"
"I am not even a US citizen, why am I still watching these 😭"
"You should do a Middle Ground, but everyone is Undecided."
WHO allowed the chick who said kamala could’ve slept with 4.5 million voters in this episode 😭
Not the micro aggressive “moderator” everyone was yelling over each other
Jubilee really milking this election
I’d love to see a panel of all well informed people who can have a debate without letting emotions take control
You guys should do a undecided voters episode
"I hope we all know that it doesn&#39;t matter who is in the &#39;top job&#39; because this is a systemic problem -- greed. We have allowed many of our economic sectors, to take advantage of the American people. It&#39;s disgusting and frightening for the future of our country. My husband and I will be retiring in the next two years n another country. We are absolutely worried that SSI will no longer be funded. we&#39;ll have to rely on his pension, a 403 (b) and a very prolific lnvestment account with my Abby Joseph Cohen my FA. Our national debt is bloating and expanding every month. Our government needs to get spending under control and cut the federal budget."
Moderator really wasn&#39;t having it today 😭😭
The guy in the middle: &quot;We can&#39;t include parts where you&#39;re yelling...&quot;<br>Jubilee: <b>Includes the parts where they&#39;re yelling</b> 🤣
"As a liberal, guy in the blue sweatshirt is frustrating. He just won’t let people talk"
Jubilee I suggest you coach the moderator to not engage in micro aggressions. There was no reason for him to stop the video just to tell Zion that they can’t have her yelling when everyone was talking over one another. I’m pretty sure that happens with every jubilee video so why call her out specifically and no one else?
the guy in the light blue hoodie was letting his emotions get the best of him sooooo much
The loudest fastest talkers are always the one doing the least thinking before they speak.
The &quot;broooo&quot; in blue has the emotional control of a third grader.
it’s crazy how the moderator called that one girl out for overlapping when literally everyone else was doing it as well. i’ve also seen him call out a specific side in other videos even when the opposite side was doing the same exact thing. either call them all out or don’t say anything. he’s my least favorite moderator
"thank you for including moderators in these recent debates, ive really seen a difference in the quality of the debates"
"That blue hoodie guy needs to GET.IT.TOGETHER. Disrespecting the other side is the worst thing anyone could do in a debate, and this guy was booming with his explosive emotions!"
"As soon as he shouted &quot;its in the bible, not now.&quot; i knew he has no idea whats going on outside his state never mind the US."
"I’m actually surprised no one is calling out the micro aggression displayed by the moderator starting at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1403"">23:23</a>. She was not yelling, she was responding just like everyone else. Why stop the entire video and tell the ONE black woman to stop yelling when she was simply responding/talking over the others like everyone else? kinda disgusted"
"I really liked the way he moderated this time around. He really kept them focused on the topic at hand, didn’t let disrespect slide, allowed a everyone to get their point through, and somehow managed to keep both sides calm.<br><br>Great job."
Blue hoodie starts speaking before he even knows what he&#39;s going to say 😂
bro in light blue tweaking 😭
Everyone was overlapping. Why only address the black woman? And she wasn&#39;t yelling.
He is offended by the term &quot;3rd world country&quot; but will do the &quot;crazy&quot; sign when talking about mental illness... the guy in the light blue is such an annoying angry hypocrite.
How tf do people already have an opinion of a 1 hour video if it got uploaded 16 minutes ago?!
"As a Canadian, I seriously wonder how much America could progress if they were focused less on the candidates and more on the policies."
I dnt even want to watch this. It&#39;s just annoying af. Mainly blue hoodie guy.
"&quot;No matter who wins, we&#39;ll be ok&quot;. The men stepped forward. This was one of the most striking moments of the entire discussion."
“You can’t go after Kamala her record is impeccable” I laughed out loud
"4 Professional Conservative Debaters vs 4 Professional Liberal Debaters???<br><br>I really just want to watch a video with a bunch of people who know what they&#39;re talking about.<br><br>Edit: Yes, I know the way to get a more informed perspective is by reading academia and not watching Jubilee videos, most people will not bother to do that, so there is value in having more knowledgeable people on a very mainstream platform, such as Jubilee."
“And how is it affecting you?” Lol girl are you not paying taxes
"Wow the hatred between the two groups is unreal. America is a sitcom. “No matter what my president does,I’ll still vote for him” is crazy, let that sink in for a minute."
I’m from Peru and I don’t know a single Peruvian who would get offended by recognizing that we  are a third-world country.
"Sometimes I get so annoyed because of huge points people miss speaking on!!! However, I REALLY appreciate the moderating truly stepping in this time FINALLY!!! Allows for more of a conversation"
I just love the nuance of the microaggression provided by the moderator. Everyone was yelling over each other but yes let’s single out the black lady 😒 pathetic
The dude in the light blue sweatshirt needs a Xanax
I feel bad for Mason being lumped together with the other Harris supporters. He truly deserved a better set of people.
"I&#39;m sorry, but the dude in the light blue hoodie is insufferable."
I vote blue but the guy in the blue sweatshirt shouldn’t have been allowed to participate. You can’t make a valid argument when all you do is yell and not hear the other side
"If you are offended by the term “3rd world country”, you are privileged beyond your wildest dreams"
As someone from an actual third world country I’m offended that dude is offended by it. It’s just the reality. Acknowledge us. We are called third world country for a reason. Too much corruption. And way under developed. There’s plenty of us here.
John (the moderator) is under appreciated— definitely my favorite person to moderate these discussions.
"I just want to make it clear for those who are saying the ONLY black girl on the panel was YELLING???? Specifically around the 20-24 min mark… you’re all incorrect, talking over someone because you to would like to be heard instead of skipped over… does not equate to yelling. You’re all showing your micro-aggression by not understanding the difference between an angry black women &amp; a black women with assertion as she speaks."
Pretty clear to see which side can have an actual conversation without constant emotions and interruptions 😅
"&quot;The term &#39;third world&#39; is offensive to me, bro&quot;<br>Your feelings aren&#39;t going to make Somalia a utopian paradise lmao"
The fact that one side COULD NOT say that extremism also exists on their side of the political isle is CRAZY.
Zion &amp; the dude in the blue were super emotional. Like STOP yelling and cutting people off when they talk. The black woman in the blazer was the best one. She actually articulated her points. The conservatives actually talked as well.
THANK YOU for finally moderating the panel. Trying hard to keep bringing it back to the actual question at hand.
Dude in the blue hoodie was unhinged out the gate.... what a psycho
Did she just say kamala&#39;s record and policy is impeccable?.
Absolutely disgusting display of micro aggressions from the moderator. Do better!
that Filipino guy was so toxic
Kamala Harris supporters not interrupt challenge: impossible
"Pretending the 3rd world doesn&#39;t exist is deeply concerning. If we don&#39;t acknowledge the conditions, what is he expecting to change?"
Did she really just ask how illegal immigrants coming into this country is affecting us. That’s all I need to hear from someone to know that they have not a single clue on what we really need for this country I’m honestly speechless
“I wasn’t yelling” literally yelled multiple times
Facts over feelings. <br>Logic over EMOTIONS.
"Zion and Blue Hoodie are unbearable. Their constant yelling over people and being emotional is draining and distracting, they dont let people talk"
Listening the the one chick call AR’s “automatic” was painful.
"As a Filipino, we do not claim that person in a blue hoodie. What a disgrace."
"I read a quote recently that went something like, “As I’ve grown older I realize how little I know. Only a young person knows everything.”"
This is why uninformed ppl shouldnt speak on these issues. These ppl have limited knowledge of what they&#39;re addressing
The moderator needs to go. That interaction between the black woman was so uncalled for and giving very much “stay in your place” as if everyone else wasn’t yelling over her.
"The higher the emotion, the lower the information."
“Do not question my morality.”<br>“I’m questioning it.” 😂
Buddy in the blue need to take a anger management class
I don’t like how this moderator only singled out the black woman about her “yelling” but literally not the others….
&quot;we don&#39;t have to fact check when we&#39;re telling the truth and telling facts&quot;. How does this even come out of someone&#39;s mouth lol
Mason is the only person I’d really like to lead the left’s points. Please let Mason back on
"“If it was actually a genocide, it would have ended in two days later, everything would be fine, everyone would be dead.” Where did she get this notion that genocides are over in two days, and how would everyone being dead make it “fine?”"
&quot;No need to fact check when everything [Harris] says is factual&quot;<br>&quot;It&#39;s hard to go after her record when her record is impeccable.&quot; <br><br>These are the people you cannot have a serious discussion with.
"&quot;No matter who wins, we&#39;ll be okay.&quot;<br>All the men stepped forward and the women stayed back.<br>No matter what happens in November, I&#39;m going to do everything in my power to make sure my family is okay."
Dude in the blue hoodie yelled more than anyone else
Not feeling that micro aggression from the moderator to the black woman for singling her out. I’ve been watching jubilee for years and people ALWAYS yell over each other but singling her out was such an “angry black woman” vibe like cmon now.
"What concerns me is no longer who gets in office, what truly concerns me is the dynamic in which (the majority) of these people are treating one another. We&#39;ve all had different upbringings, experiences, and perspectives. We&#39;ve all fallen victim to political lies at some point, and truly, to believe solely in one candidate, is concerning. At the end of the day, we have to care care of one another, and understand it&#39;s our differences in perspectives and experiences that is what should be treated like gold. Because together, we are stronger."
&quot;If it was a genocide it would have ended like 2 days later&quot; <br><br>WWII called. They said hey.
"As a lifelong Democrat, the fact that 3/4 of the dems don&#39;t think there are extremists on their side is exactly the type of thinking that made me realize the Democratic party runs on emotions and not logic. <br><br>Even as a Democrat myself I can&#39;t help but see this as uninformed emotions vs logical assessments. I feel very disillusioned with my party."
Everyone was yelling over each other so why is he singling her out? Weird
Emotional voters are dangerous
They need to stop bringing this little Republican girl to the debates oml.
Moderator literally peforming microagression by specifically calling out the black girl for &quot;yelling&quot; over people when literally everyone was constantly talking over each other. And the decision to keep that clip in is very telling jubilee...
"This moderator had me pleasantly surprised. He moderated well and when things got out of control, he swept in and put everyone back on track.<br><br>And especially when he asked the question if anyone agreed that there were extreme people on their side. The progressive side gave what he deemed to be a disingenuous answer and he called them out for it, rightfully so."
&quot;In the bible bro NOT NOW!!!&quot; <br>Damn...he really doesn&#39;t know what happens in islamic countries does he?
"When the guy in light blue talks, all I hear is a baby crying"
Liberals are so funny! They really are sensitive to just about anything😂😂
"I&#39;m African, from Nigeria and the term &quot;third world&quot; is not offensive. Don&#39;t be offended on my behalf. It&#39;s the truth, and yes, many 3rd world countries are indeed &quot;shithole&quot; countries. If you&#39;ve lived here, you would understand, and if they were not, their citizens wouldn&#39;t be leaving to the US in droves."
"As a Filipino, that bro is the softest, most-sensitive Filipino I know. Really?? The term-third world offends you? 😂"
Omg that girl calling Kamala impeccable 😂 I just can&#39;t.
The vet chick I call bull. No way she is a vet and calling Guns (A.R) Machine guns. That’s incredibly ignorant.
Calling Harris &quot;impeccable&quot; is just a clear sign that she has not looked into her record. I would push Jubilee to host a longer form debate style with higher educated guests.
Please be more specific with the fact checks. 8.2 million at the border isn&#39;t a meaningful statistic without telling me if it was last year or over the last 4 years or another time period.
the entire jubilee social media team needs a raise for how well they’ve marketed the channel over the past few weeks
Kamala came with facts?! WHERE PLEASE SHOW ME THE FACTS!
Can we get a middle class vs the ultra wealthy debate? I don&#39;t think people realize that we aren&#39;t divided by party but by wealth.
On behalf of the Filipino American community we don’t claim Erick. That dude is a clown and not a comedian 🤡
The guy from Phillipines is so emotional😂😂😂
blue hoodie guy is such a bitter angry person
The American exceptionalism is wild. As a Canadian I feel like I won the lottery by NOT being born in the US.
So everyone else was yelling over each other and somehow only ONE girl in particular gets singled out…hmmm
That guy in blue sweater yelling all the time had emotional damage.
Kamala has a horrible record.
Mason seemed like the only person that actually wanted to have a civil debate
Jubilee has been absolutely locking in
Jubilee be feeding us political content
"&quot;Third World&quot; should not be offensive. The first responsibility of a leader is to define reality. I am from the third world, and this doesn&#39;t make me subhuman."
I feel so sorry for John the moderator. I hope they are paying him well lol.
The “moderator” calling out the black woman in front of everyone for “yelling” yet every single person there was “overlapping” and “yelling”.  It’s crazy that so many people are skipping over this micro aggression.
Bro is getting better with moderating! The way he keeps up with people’s original points and questions in the middle of all the screeching back and forth is next level!
"wow, the democrats not being ashamed of ANYONE on their side, is absolutely insane and telling."
That girl actually just said “how does immigration affect you?”<br><br>Can’t make this up
"Shout out to Mason, very clear, concise and respectful!"
Imagine saying someone has an impeccable record and then only naming the titles that they have held. No policy. No record. Just titles. Lot of bad people in history have held a lot of titles…how impeccable are their records?
that moderator displayed clear and blatant micro aggression towards that black lady .. that’s actually crazy
is there a reasons the moderator singled her out? everyone was speaking over each other…
Please be more specific with the fact checks. 8.2 million at the border isn&#39;t a meaningful statistic without telling me if it was last year or over the last 4 years or another time period.
the guy in blue hoodie is so irritating bruhh he talks so offensive
Dude in the light blue hoodie didn’t add to any conversation in this video. Everybody else brought valid points on both sides.
it’s wildly racist that the moderator literally singled out that one black girl like wtf
There is a major lack of political knowledge in this video is crazy
"I really enjoyed hearing from Joe, Mason, and Osiris. You can tell they are smart and they care about people."
"Girl: * shouts *<br>Moderator: To have a conversation you need to stop shouting.<br>Girl: I wasn&#39;t shouting.<br><br>Girl, we got you in 4K HD shouting, stop with the gaslighting. 😂"
I’m so shocked no one is talking about the micro aggression displayed by this moderator. That’s crazy work
The same &quot;not yelling&quot; woman who corrected the pronunciation of Comma-La later said Ka-MAH-La.  LoL
"&quot;If it was a genocide, it would have ended 2 days later, would be flattened and everyone would have been dead&quot; is such an atrocious statement to make"
Dude in the Blue is softer than that sweater he’s wearing lol … he got that victim mentality 😂😂
Everyone was interrupting each other. So why did the moderator fix his simple self to stand up and single the black woman out in front of everyone? I&#39;ve literally NEVER seen this happen on jubilee for.
As a liberal: I cannot stand liberals.
I am a democrat but Osiris was a Class Act. He communicated his points factually and without hyperbolic extremist accusations. <br>We need more people like him
"Zion jumped in to correct the other girl for saying Kamala wrong but pronounces it the same way at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=2190"">36:30</a>. 😂😂"
I like how he just called out the blk girl like everyone else wasn’t yelling over each too…
“We cannot include parts where you’re yelling over people.”<br><br>I’M NOT YELLING!?! 😂
"The gaslighting “I am not yelling!”  Ma’am, you were absolutely YELLING."
The girl that said “how is it affecting you?”<br>GIRLLLLLL they’re living on our TAX PAYING DOLLARS <br>Common sense here pls.
The moderator targeting the young black girl for “yelling” when she’s talking just like everyone else is disgusting. The moderator couldn’t control the racism spewing out of him.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=18"">0:18</a> Even john is tired of these😭"
"The most frustrating part of debates like these is the overwhelming, uncomfortable feeling that arises when either side refuses to consider other perspectives. When emotions take over and people become aggressive, it shuts down meaningful dialogue and leaves little room for progress.<br><br>Both sides were guilty of this at times, but I appreciated the moments when they tried to keep it civil and respectful. Our emotions can become our worst enemies if we don&#39;t learn to understand them as our allies first."
"People need to stop saying the 2nd amendment exists so you can protect your family. That’s certainly a perk, but it exists so we can stand against a tyrannical government. Hunting, self defense, etc are all benefits of the 2nd amendment, but first and foremost it is so we can keep our government in check"
"Um, why did the moderator single out the black woman as if everyone wasn&#39;t talking over each other and interrupting???"
I never have commented on one YouTube video in my life but I just have to say that this moderator is the best one on this channel. He is consistent &amp; stays pretty neutral!
“It’s hard to go after her record cause it’s impeccable”…..I never laughed so hard in my life
The liberal guy in light blue knows so much that just isn’t true.
The moderator idk something about he solely directing the yelling comment at shawty when they all was over talkin each other it felt microaggressive and tone deaf
The dude who said tipped employees already dont have to pay taxes does not know what he is talking about.
Kamala is &quot;impeccable??? 😂
yall brought that girl back 😭😭
"Not them stopping the whole discussion just to single out the black girl for “yelling”. As if I can’t pull up multiple clips of people actually yelling, this is why I hate jubilee, micro aggression at its finest."
guy in the blue hoodie is SOFT even if you disagree with the other side there’s no reason to act like that
“Do not question my morality”<br><br>“I’m questioning it” <br><br>😂
It&#39;s priceless to see  the Dr. talks passionately about  her family fleeing from persecution and yet not be  understanding of others.
The micro aggressions from the moderator singling the black woman out?????
You can tell which side is full of hatred.
It’s insane how so many don’t understand economics. Inflation is caused by the devalumdnt of our currency (USD) our government borrows money at an alarming rate. Plus the price of goods has increased because the price of oil has increased. The two biggest oil exporters are locked in wars at the moment. Oil is king! Oil being more expensive makes EVERYTHING more expensive.
Blue hoodie needs to take a little nap
It’s Jubilee I’ve never seen the moderators call out people for debating or yelling. Yet we want to do it to the black girl?
"Anyone who agrees with the first prompt is not a reasonable person. If there is no dealbreaker for a candidate, you are in a cult."
I LITERALLY knew who was on what side the second I saw faces.
"Everyone yelling over everyone, yet she gets called out for it? Please be so serious 😒"
"Pretty clear the difference between the sides, One side is yelling over the ones that want to have a civil conversation 😂😂"
&quot;Why does someone have to contribute to recieve those resources&quot; the millions of working americans who contribute and will never be eligible to recieve those resources
"Why is there such a blatant difference between one side that can discuss, and one that has a difficult time with basic emotion control?"
"We are so close to China, Russia and Iran being capable of knocking out our infastructure! If that happens we are all going to wish we had lots of guns! This isnt the 1920s anymore! The threat is real of an invastion!"
I really hate the guy in light blue and Zion<br>Extremely cocky and condescending.
"“And how is it affecting you”.. “I will tell you” proceeds to tell her, and then she has a LOST FACE LMAO"
"As a fellow Philippino American, I’m ashamed at how much of a victim the gentleman in the blue hoodie is."
yes let’s reprimand the black woman for “yelling” when she literally wasn’t yelling and she was doing the same thing all the participants do in every debate
AR 15 is NOT a machine gun! That veteran should know this.
The fact that everyone let her say that fully automatic weapons are legal is wild.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1910"">31:50</a>  girl. I grew up in Jacksonville Fl. In the hood! These people will always have guns girl! You going to go to bat with someone that has a automatic gun then a regular one"
these people who cannot admit there are extremists are their side are the MOST dangerous
That Erik guy is the most insufferable victim to grace jubilee and that’s saying a lot
"It’s easy to see who actually makes an effort to fact check what the media is feeding them, and who guzzles it down w abandon without a second thought.<br><br>Shout out to the fact checking on this channel. Everyone should fact check EVERY media narrative via the sponsor of this debate."
"As a European, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever understand the blind devotion Americans have to their country.. &quot;Us as Americans, all of us hit the lottery when we got born here.&quot; &quot;America is the greatest country on earth...&quot; And then they keep talking about the most ridiculous issues like gun violence, inaccessible health care, student loans, etc..."
Not mentioning the 30+ LIES Kamala was pushing during the debate was a big miss
I’m black and that black girl and filipino dude getting on my nerves lol!!! Everything based on emotion… the people are here - the part to secure us has already passed
I’m Filipino and we do not claim that guy. Dudes crazy..
“kamala has an impeccable record.”<br>the prisoners who had their sentences extended for cheap labor: 👁️👄👁️
I’m just here because the host was being racist towards the black girl.
"Saying Kamala is “Impeccable” (and meaning it), is wild!"
“Well It’s hard to go after her record when it’s impeccable” I spit my drink out<br><br>Edit: I’m fairly middle ground. But there’s a reason Kamala Harris lost the democratic primary elective vote for PRESIDENT last election. And she didn’t earn it this election either.
&quot;It’s hard to go after her record when she&#39;s impeccable.&quot; I couldn&#39;t stop laughing after that.
"This was the perfect example of liberals 😂 they just can&#39;t have a conversation. They can only talk about how things make them feel, no facts."
Big guy in the tan shirt represents a silent majority.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=352"">5:52</a> “your people” crazy"
Guy in blue shirt needs psychological help😂
"as someone that voted for biden, opening my eyes and actually listening to reasoning and how things actually DO affect us, i did a complete 180"
Why are the Kamala supporters just yelling the whole time 😂
I like that John is putting his foot down more.
the guy in the blue hoodie is to caught in his emotions to debate
Jubilee needs to address the microaggression that occurred when the moderator singled out the only Black woman in the group. To reprimand her for behavior that other participants are displaying is very telling.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=2190"">36:30</a> why didn&#39;t they correct how she said her name?  hypocrisy is real."
DUDE IN LIGHT BLUE IS OFFENDED BY AIR
Dude in the blue sweatshirt thinks he&#39;s smart.  He&#39;s NOT.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1942"">32:22</a> says she is a veteran but doesn&#39;t know the average gun owner can&#39;t have a machine gun. You have to be approved by the federal government for that."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1695"">28:15</a> this girl has said homophobic and racist things 😂😂😂 she just keeps outing herself in these vidoes"
All he heard was the black woman “yelling” when the whole panel was doing what they brought them there to do.. have an debate ..ugh the micro aggression is crazy 🙄
The guy in the blue was cutting ppl off the whole time and everyone was talking over everyone but you call out and single out the only black women. Interesting. Take him out
The Filipino dude is more emocional than my wife on her period 😂
"@JohnRegalado the way you singled out the young black woman during this discussion &amp; tried to state that she was YELLING. wicked work. &amp; WILD to state when everyone was indeed talking over eachother. Like she said, she was not yelling. Not even gonna go into the detail of how that LOOKS for you to be saying that to a black woman, but I hope she got an apology when you wrapped because it was 100% uncalled for. Do better or don’t moderate."
"I hate that no one clarified that people seeking asylum are not here illegally no matter how you feel about it, it is a legal process in the US"
That black veteran chick clearly failed the rifle range at boot camp
"As a Filipino American, Erick is just an embarrassment sheesh"
The guy in the blue hoodie is proof that immigrants need to be vetted better.
"I want to thank Jubilee for opening up these conversations. Hate them or love them, these conversations NEED to be had!! Period."
"i have watched tons of jubilee videos where people are yelling/talking over each other. in this video specifically everyone is literally talking over each other, but only the black girl gets called out for “yelling”? interesting…. find urself a better moderator jubilee. not one that’s gonna contribute to the microaggressions of one side"
"The girl who claimed to have been deployed conflated an AR-15 with an Automatic Rifle and Automatic Machine Gun. An AR-15 is semi-automatic and is not much different from semi-automatic pistols in terms of lethality! Even if she never held a gun, this lack of basic gun knowledge from someone in the military is shocking."
"I am a Filipino American. I lived in Philippines for 27 years, nobody there ever thought that calling Philippines a 3rd world country makes us less human. LMAO. That 3rd world country label was never brought up by liberal activists as degrading even today."
Whoever the moderator is needs to be put in his place. Why you getting thinking you the sh*t telling a black woman you gonna cut out the parts where she’s yelling like the whole debate isn’t just y’all yelling back and forth.  jubilee your getting blocked after this
Love Mason &amp; Joe! They have such a great temperament &amp; an ability to be critical about their own side which is SO important.
"As a Filipino myself, we’re not known as dog eaters as Erick mentioned <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=383"">6:23</a>.... Dude is over exaggerating 😂 I’ll joke every so often that we eat Aso (dog in Tagalog) Adobo, but dog eating is more from China, mainly Yulin or Ghana…"
"Homegirl from the hood that&#39;s also a vet, knows nothing that&#39;s going down in her streets, extended mags, everybody by now owns a switch, they don&#39;t rob in the hood they go to the rich neighborhoods. Proves just cause your military doesn&#39;t mean your the sharpest."
"As a Filipino, I did eat a dog when I was young back in the Philippines. It was a cultural thing in some provinces."
The fact that they’re critical about the pronunciation of her name like they know her says a lot about where they stand lol
They didn not expect Zion to be a Vetaran from the Hood 😂
"About the immigration issue, 158 Democrats just voted no on deporting illegal immigrants convicted of sex crimes."
Filipino dude said they didn’t eat dogs in the Philippines 😂
Zion she’s screaming like a lunatic. I am glad the moderator warned her against her bad demeanor.
“Why do they need to contribute for health care!!!”<br><br>That’s all we needed to hear lol
As a European it is always amusing to see US-Americans proclaiming themselves as lucky to be born in the best country in the world.
I’m just wondering why all these people can speak more civilly and articulately about issues/policies than our current leaders and most major media outlets… I respect anyone who is willing to have difficult/uncomfortable conversations (especially publicly).
&quot;IM A VETEREN!&quot; Proceeds to not know the difference between a legal AR15 and an already illegal automatic &quot;machine gun&quot;.
Zion is a veteran but doesn&#39;t know that an AR-15 is not a machine gun...
shoutout the moderator John kept it cool under both parties speaking over each other
She claims to be a vet but refers to a semi automatic weapon as a machine gun
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=2125"">35:25</a> blaming kamala for there being less scholarships is crazy😭 why is this girl back she had horrible arguments in the last video"
“When she’s impeccable” I’m gonna crash out fr
The girl opened her mouth about being in the military. And then called an AR-15 a machine gun. Obviously she didn&#39;t learn anything about guns
I&#39;d love to see Joe and Zekiah have a more intimate discussion. They seemed very respectful and thoughtful.
Why do all of Jubilee&#39;s video pick the WORST democrats or leftists to argue for their side? They almost always try to talk over people and never listen to the other side. I want to give massive props to Mason who was the only reasonable person for the Harris supporters who was able to have a reasionale discussion without getting upset or yelling.
"Omg, this video was so hard to watch! Now I understand better the meaning of &quot; they have eyes but cannot see;  they have ears but cannot hear&quot;."
"Ms. Zion, you should let people enter YOUR home without any restrictions simply because “they deserve it”"
The fact checks in these videos are awesome. Thanks for including those!
&quot;He can&#39;t go after her record because her record is impeccable&quot;<br><br>Sure it is. That&#39;s exactly why she refuses to talk about it and deflects every time it gets brought up.
Lol....Kamala is impeccable??? Wow
Being all posh and over reacting/correcting someone on how they accidentally pronounce her name wrong is such a turn off
Scarf lady saying that the KKK wasn’t a problem because there weren’t enough members is wild
lol why do I just click on these videos only to immediately read the comments 🤣diabolical
This girl who claims  to be a veteran clearly knows nothing about guns
Ben Shapiro vs 20 liberal
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1424"">23:44</a> oh micro aggression"
The “I’m a veteran chick” that had other people guarding her with actual automatic guns needs a reality check
&quot;The term 3rd world is offensive to me like we&#39;re subhuman&quot;  What???
“And how is this affecting you” has to be the most entitled/delusional response.
She said kamala is impeccable on her reputation 😂😂😂😅😅
"One side seems to be more calm, articulate, and smart, the other sides are the opposite (loud, offended by anything, not making sense at times, and etc)."
A veteran calling an AR-15 a machine gun. Which branch was she?
"Bipartisan Border Bill<br>Total size: $118.3 billion<br><br>   - $60 billion in military aid for Ukraine<br>   - $14.1 billion in aid for Israel<br>   - $4.83 billion in aid for the Indo-Pacific region<br>   - $10 billion in humanitarian assistance for Ukraine, Israel, Gaza, among other places<br>   - $2.3 billion in refugee assistance inside the U.S.<br>   - $20.2 billion for improvements to U.S. border security<br>   - $2.72 billion for domestic uranium enrichment<br><br>The majority of the money of this bill has nothing to do with securing the border of the U.S. This is why it was voted against."
Shame on you moderator.. to “not include” a black woman’s point specifically when she is responding like every other person on EVERY OTHER episode including this one.
“I’m offended by the term third world”😂😂
“It’s hard to go after her record when she’s impeccable” THE GLAZING
Automatic rifles are already banned wtf.  Also did she really victim blame and say what are you doing wrong that people are trying to break into your house.
"Single out the black woman when EVERYONE is yelling, you suck John."
These people are goofy if they think citizens from over 160 countries are fleeing persecution. 160+ countries? NO!
I don’t know I don’t study the KKK 😅😂 best quote in the interview 😅
“It’s hard to go off her record because she is impeccable” 🤣what has she done in the past 3.5 years?
tone policing black women is crazy
Don&#39;t they understand he was president for 4 years?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=99"">1:39</a> “I’m afraid to see what our country would look like” acting like he wasn’t president before 💀"
Her saying &quot;I&#39;m a veteran who makes bombs&quot; and then calling AR-15&#39;s machine guns is wild.
Moderator needs to check himself. The micro aggression was so blatant. How did the editor or literally ANYONE sitting there not clock him when he did that? Tf?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=268"">4:28</a> &quot;we don&#39;t have to fact check when we&#39;re telling the truth&quot; ... that&#39;s not how fact checking works Ma&#39;am 😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1400"">23:20</a> Zion: <b>Interrupts and yells</b> “I’m not yelling!” 😂😂😂<br><br>Surprised Jubilee actually pointed that out fairly though"
Can we just appreciate Mason&#39;s honesty and intellect? His positions are well thought out with concrete evidence. 👏👏
why are we singling out the black women if every episode and everyone in this episode is talking over someone?
Blue sport coat is exactly who you would expect to worship someone like Kamala. 😂
"The guy in the brown on the Harris side toward the end you could tell even he annoyed with the others on his side. He was the only reasonable one, thinking with EVERY American in mind. Then his counterparts jump in with wild antics while he’s speaking so eloquently and he just pauses and ignored them 😂"
"the guy in the brown shirt with flowers was so well spoken, that we should all give him a hand"
why was only the black women called out for yelling when the other lady was actually yelling…. hmm 🤔
Blue sweater is annoying and doesn’t have a real opinion on anything.
They failed to mention the reason the “boarder bill” wasn’t passed is bc it includes sending billions more dollars to Ukraine and Israel for some reason.  Idk why but I read the bill and it basically says 1500+ more boarder security and patrol and send a bunch of money to other countries.
The guy in the light blue sweatshirt completely ticked me off
I have seen so much worse from ppl but you tone police the black woman
I stopped caring what the veteran had to say when she thinks owning machine guns are legal. They are already illegal. She thinks AR-15 means automatic rifle 🤣😂🤣😂
When will jubilee actually find well-informed people for these debates and ensure that they stay formal?
"she said that there are no troops in combat zones and thats not true there are still US troops in Iraq, we have ships being shot at in the red sea, we have special forces in Africa and Ukraine"
People were caught eating cats and that&#39;s a fact. Ka&#39;mala  won&#39;t even speak about it because she can&#39;t. She&#39;d have to admit she&#39;s a liar.
“Automatic Rifle” 😂<br><br>Armalite Rifle. “Machine guns” banned in 86.
It’s so funny how quickly they jump on the pronunciation of Kamala when their own president says it wrong. Why are they so triggered. They’re like raging hounds
My rights don’t end where people’s feelings begin.
An hour and they didn&#39;t figure out they are all losers.
"As a spanish person, I find so questionable that several of Trump&#39;s radical statements have to be &quot;watered down&quot; by some of his rather conscious voters. Saying that immigrants eat pets or that completely formed babies are being murdered may be understood as hyperboles  by some people, but in a country where polarization is so present, some crazy people (with guns, even) might take those affirmations literally, and that&#39;s just wildly dangerous."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1365"">22:45</a> Kamala girl got cooked and she knew it💀"
"“Why does someone have to contribute to receive healthcare” is crazyyyyyy work, it cost me $17000 to give birth to my child WITH insurance."
Why are those lefty’s always shouting?
That black girl who claims to be a veteran thinks AR-15s are machine guns 😂😂😂😂😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=225"">3:45</a> well well well"
Eric was fact checked so many times after claiming he did his own research. Lol 😂
"I hate that they don&#39;t bring up that we ruined those countries that those immigrants are coming from, so we have a moral responsibility to do somthing. Yet they all just cry about the innocent civillians who are running away from the authoritarian, heavily corrupt and dangerous place they&#39;re from."
"i don’t get how zion immediately corrected the trumpies on saying kamala’s name incorrectly, then proceeded to do it herself🧍‍♀️"
Why don&#39;t any of these Republicans push back on the border bill and what was actually in it.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=208"">3:28</a> saying that after stating that there’s no genocide in gaza is crazy"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=2806"">46:46</a> LMAO she basically said that that is a problem that doesn’t affect me so I don’t care! That’s wild"
"Crazy how she says you don’t have to fact check something that is true, yet many people proved Harris was wrong on many things on the debate."
America is just a TV drama show at this point 😂
"I would like see a format like this again, but with only age 50+"
I can tell who the host is voting for 😅
"How are people commenting on the video like they have finished it, its only been 4 minutes."
Well Machine guns are all ready federally regulated and you can’t just go legally buy a machine gun..🤣 Even that veteran doesn’t know that and thinks an AR is an assault rifle is laughable. 🤣🤣
"&quot;I&#39;m not yelling&quot; after immidiatly yelling. Thank you for calling out Zion! The entitlment is pallpable. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1415"">23:35</a>"
"Not them making it a big deal and correcting her on how to pronounce Kamala correctly, then later that veteran girl pronounces her name incorrectly the same way"
Watching these videos make me realize why the US is in the situation it is in. When you select a candidate you should be required to complete a multiple choice question on their top things they&#39;re running on (for both sides). Identity politics is an unfortunate reality which prevents growth and leaves people wondering why we are where we are today.
Why they not fact checking Kamala supporters?
"Shes a veteran, but doesn&#39;t know the difference between a US military assault rifle and a civilian AR15....smfh."
"Filipino dude,,, if you so upset… what about you go take that energy and fix your own country!! 🙄"
poor John he was probably screaming on the inside while moderating 😂
"The fact that they just said that there’s no extremists on the Democrat side is wild to me, even as a conservative, I still agree that there are extremists on my side that I wish we’re not there, but it’s the truth. Hopefully people in the comments do not share their sentiment."
She’s a veteran calling a ar15 a machine gun? Yea ok 🙄
Jubilee I’m highly disappointed on how the MODERATOR singled out the one black woman when everyone was talking. Very distasteful and micro aggressive.
Light blue hoodie is disrespectful and rude. How was he chosen as a representative for this show.
Why were they rattled about pronunciation of Kamala 😂.
"This is the first middle ground in a while where they didn’t include hardcore extremists on either side, and the moderator actually moderated fairly. Thank you"
that black lady was not a vet. she doesnt know an ar15 is not automatic?? all her points were beyond ridiculous
"Kamala Harris didn&#39;t say she would give $25,000 to a first-time homeowner. She said it would be a $25,000 tax credit. The difference is enormous. As someone who&#39;s never made over $25,000 in one year it will literally do nothing for me. It will be a huge help to rich folk though."
"The one girls whole point against “weapons of mass destruction” was that there is not groups of people attacking you and you don’t need that type of gun but then later when the point about the K K K was brought up she said she was afraid of that group of people. So which is it, are there groups of people you need to be able to defend yourself against or not?"
She&#39;s a veteran who built bombs but thinks people are walking around with automatic weapons?!? oh boy...
Ka&#39;mala sent people to prison for a little weed because they laughed too much. If we&#39;re going by her logic then she should be locked away for 300 years.
I like how the FactChecks show how way worst the numbers are 😂
They should do Ben Shapiro v 25 liberals
Notice which side is very quick to interrupt to argue a point instead of hearing out the other side.
They are eating the dogs and cats!
"Can you believe the stupidity; she does not have impeccable record? It sounds like “I see nothing, hear nothing” the blind leading the blind! Springfield, Ohio citizens claimed their pets were being eaten in their city council meetings. Look at Vivek town hall meeting in Springfield,Ohio. Unless, you guys are going to play the game “hear nothing and see nothing “."
Took me an hr to realize mason got 1 hand😂
"People already chose their candidates - There&#39;s no undecided at this point, just pretenders"
i cant wait until whoever Wins....just to see the others faces
Holy crow an AR-15 is not a machine gun. It&#39;s not an automatic firearm they are all ready banned. This is probably the worst panel I&#39;ve ever seen
Machine guns have been banned since 1986. Semi-automatic and fully-automatic aren’t the same. Almost every pistol is semi-auto. How does she not know that and how did nobody fact check her?
Erik Is What’s Called A ‘Professional Victim’
"Go ahead and fire that moderator. Such OBVIOUS microagression. She was not yelling. She was speaking the same volume as everyone else. If she was louder than them I think we would&#39;ve heard her points clear as day, however I couldn&#39;t hear ANY of them talking because they were ALL talking over one another. But for him to SINGLE her out.... Very telling. Disgusting behavior for a moderator. He should have spoken to ALL of them and not single one person out. Gross. Don&#39;t let him come back ."
The bipartisan bill they keep talking about only 25% went to the border 60 billion to Ukraine no one ever brings that up
An average person does not require an assault weapon..
We Republicans don&#39;t want Cheney either 👎🏻
I&#39;ll use the term 3rd world all day &amp; all night... bro
mason is so well spoken
"Imagine being a vet and saying ar15 is a machine gun lmao, she build bombs okay yeah you didn&#39;t need a gun because you weren&#39;t a ground soldier and had people guarding you. Why do people think every gun that looks military style is a fully automatic gun?"
That moderator is a saint lmao 😂
I know Jubilee isn’t supporting microagressions? She deserves a public apology.
“Why should they contribute to receive healthcare.” <br>Said someone who I guarantee has never paid taxes in her life.
Can someone please explain to these people that an AR15 is not an assault weapon!!! It&#39;s not full auto!!! Most people do not have a class 3 license to own a full auto weapon!!!!
Is that the plastic surgeon from that other episode???
"Bro everyone for Kamala is so unbalanced and stay cutting people off, can’t even let people finish a statement"
"Just because you are a veteran does not mean you know anything about guns. AR 15 is not a machine gun. Also, 2A shall not be infringed. End of argument"
She is in charge now! Why isn&#39;t she doing it now???
Bro how are ppl saying it’s ok for Palestine to attacking Israel. NEITHER should be attacking the others.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1428"">23:48</a> soooo just wanna say American people go to other countries for both dental and medical treatments that would cost more if they did it here"
It&#39;s a congress&#39; job to come up with border policy. Not the president&#39;s!
"THEYRE EATING THE DOGS, THEYRE EATING THE CATS!"
Mad respect to the moderator
"Why can only 2 people on liberal team keep there act together?  Shocking how one-sidedley rude this Jubilee was. Did not know people were getting this crazy this year, but i guess it should be expected given the guy who was being demonized for 8 + years is close to winning again."
Did I just hear a veteran call an AR 15 a machine gun?
&quot;Why do you have to contribute to receive health care?&quot; wild comment there Zion
That one guy in the blue was so damn annoying the whole time. Why is he so angry
Why he say something to Zion but the dude in the blue hoodie over talking damn near everybody and barley saying anything beneficial from my perspective
the dude in the blue is unhinged.
"“He would have to be something outrageous for me not to vote for him”…. I’m sorry, define outrageous please"
This group was considerably more well spoken than any of the previous debates. Some outbursts but nothing like the other ones with extreme personalities on both sides.
Wonder if girl is going to have the wait and see attitude in a couple years when it comes to illegal immigration 🤔
"I see a group of people being emotional, yelling, basing their views off feelings and another group being logical basing their views off facts"
To be fair the people from the  Philippines do eat dogs. My neighbor behind me is 1st generation from the Philippines and years ago he told me that his friends here in town also from the Philippines catch strays and have them over a bonfire in their back yards.
How is a military &quot;vet&quot; going to equate an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle with a machine gun?
"get that moderator out of here…. weird for calling only one person out, saying she’s yelling, when all she was doing was responding."
Thinking an ar is a machine gun is crazy.
Question 1. Voting for a candidate despite if they do something horrible is the exact reason why politics is a joke.
The tan shirt guy is definitely the guy I most align with. (They should wear nametags lol😂)
Why those dems all so mad
How are you calling this  &quot;Middle Ground&quot; when you are causing tension and beef between Americans?
She said they have a map to recieve free health care...that&#39;s wild because thats probably how Canadians talk about Americans because Canada has ACTUAL free health care 😂
I’ve realized that Aniela takes part of these videos a lot
Zion and the blue hoodie guy are the worst kinds of people. Can&#39;t even have a conversation.
"I love people who want to ban guns still think AR15s are machine guns. It’s crazy no one corrected her, or it was edited out."
Now this is the conversation we need
Haris supporters are delusional😅 dude in the blue sweater is emotional and needs to calm down.
The blue hoodie is a cry baby and won’t let people talk 😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡
The Zionist in the beginning who brought up genocide really thought that was a flex 😂
brooooo in the blue a disgrace to all filipino’s (im filipino) dude is an emotional mess wtf 😭
The more of these videos I watch the more I really can’t stand liberals. And I used to be one.
"blue hoodie and the veteran lady were insufferable. truly hard to watch because of them. everyone else was very civil and actually seemed to want to debate each other, while they clearly just wanted to fight. glad the moderator stepped in."
You guys need to get better at moderating these. 3/10
"I’m mad anyone is arguing with the Pakistani immigrant over morality towards immigrants..yes we want to help everyone, but realistically, can we?"
Sad blue sweater guy and vet girl should have just stay home😅
Don’t bring this moderator back that was a whole micro aggression
The 25k for first time home buyers will be dpg eared for immigrants.
That was very weird of the moderator 🤨
I love the question on if you agree with policies on the other side. I consider myself independent and feel both sides have some decent policies.
why the democrats supporters just screaming over and over again
this moderator sucks smh
us filipinos dont claim the guy in blue sweatshirt
racist micro aggressive moderator yelling at the black woman but not anyone else
"Why is it so hard to understand the concept of illegal<br>Immigrants..<br>That’s like someone coming into your house uninvited, not doing chores or contributing.. then eating all your food and taking your bed.."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=285"">4:45</a> Why wasn’t this fact-checked? Hypocrites…"
as a democrat these democrats were embarrassing
jubilee COUNT UR DAYSS! the micro-aggressions in this video was crazy… everyone was “yelling” or speaking over each other not only in this video but other videos and u had the nerve to say that to her 😒 i know yall reading these comments
Blue hoody has no chill.
"They are eating cats, dogs, duck and protected Canadian Geese!!!"
"An AR-15 isn&#39;t a machine gun, the &quot;veteran&quot; did not use an AR-15 overseas (we use M4s), and it isn&#39;t used in most school shootings (the media calls every rifle an AR-15 style rifle).  Where&#39;s the fact check on this?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1407"">23:27</a> blue sweatshirt guy won’t let anyone talk without steam rolling them but as soon as a black woman does she needs to take it down a notch  ?? where is media training for moderators? asking for jubilee"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1530"">25:30</a> and to the woman from Iran … so it was okay when you and your family did it but not for other people trying to escape from whatever they are trying to escape from"
In this video there was no middle ground it was the Sleepy people want to get the point across just to interrupt people did not have sex while she was she was trying to be da of California
"The Central Park 5 were children, they were coerced into confessing, and they has no representation or parents present! Come again the Facts!"
"An immediate problem I&#39;ve noticed, is that most of the Harris supporters (shown in this video) react with their emotions on their sleeves ever single time they don&#39;t agree with the other side. there&#39;s nothing wrong with not agreeing , but at least give the others the courtesy to finish a thought out before you want to blurt out your response."
"Mason seemed like the only guy that is willing to actually have a conversation on the democrat side.  None of them are gonna change sides on this show.  But he was embarrassed about his colleagues, you could tell."
"How is it that these debates always go the same way? One side is calm, respectful, and bring facts to the table, the other side is angry, emotional, and resorts to personal attacks. I&#39;ll let you all figure out who&#39;s who..."
"Who&#39;s this like group of people coming in and knocking and banging down ya&#39;lls doors?  What are you doing to bring that in your life, A? And B, if you didn&#39;t need AR15 -- you&#39;re talking to a veteran, okay?  I didn&#39;t really need to walk around with an AR -- veteran who built bombs... bla blah&quot;....  So basically she&#39;s saying I&#39;ve never been in that situation, so nobody else has either.  Move to Las Vegas, move to Californian.... have someone rob you while you&#39;re home."
"Anybody else notice scarf lady said she was both a medical practitioner that sees migrants with maps  and also a plastic surgeon who sees kids who want to transition? I don&#39;t know if I trust that lady&#39;s surgical hands, she can&#39;t even keep her story straight."
Ok tbh can we at least all agree that Eric is really annoying and took away from what could have been a beneficial and effective conversation/debate for both sides. Also I really didn’t appreciate the overlap from Kamala’s side. The only people I really cared to listen too on that side where the people on the ends.
"Ppl with no children, don’t own a home or  business, and are under 25 should have a half vote 🤣🤣😂😂 their perspective of the world is a mess"
I find it interesting how the world over citizens obsess over what leaders say and completely color over what they do
It&#39;s a fact that the former Governor of Virginia&#39;s proposal was assuming abortion up until birth and his comment was that the baby would be kept comfortable until the parents &quot;decided what to do with it&quot;.
They looked for any way to be offended. Freakin’ about how Kamala’s name is pronounced 😂. Happy she didn’t give into them.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1980"">33:00</a> Slippery slope fallacy. I personally don&#39;t mind if assault rifles are legal to those without red flags or violent crime history. But saying they will outlaw every gun isn&#39;t a valid argument."
"Can&#39;t go after her accomplishments, all of them handed to her. Her policy is not impeccable, she doesn&#39;t even have a policy it&#39;s so radicalized he can&#39;t talk about it."
"Blue hoodie and Zion were painful to listen to, just the worst takes, every garbage talking point. As delusional as the stuff I see on Reddit."
Holy F.. who is going to pay for all those benefits. I am not going to pay for it. Your money is your money not governments.
Anyone that hears a word and outwardly tells anyone that they are offended by the word need to hide under blankets for the rest of their life.
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1366"">22:46</a> &quot;16 million illegal immigrants are already here! &quot; - &quot;And how is this affecting you?&quot; ... Huh? Are you for real?"
I like how everyone on the panel was just pretending like &quot;machine guns&quot; are legal in the US. Wow. Smart group you got there. 🤦‍♂️
That brown young lady has a lot of growing up and realizations she is going to have…
For you to not be taxed you have to make under 13k… you can definitely make more than 13k a year in many tip based service jobs.
The moderator allowed the guy in Blue to talk to much and his rhetoric was based off of emotions and not facts.
Why would yall single out the black woman when literally EVERYONE was over talking one another. The moderator being micro-aggressive is actually insane
I recommend inviting a big security guy every time you invite that Philippino guy. The guy&#39;s too angry.
Doesn’t everyone in these middle ground videos talk over and yell over other people? Jubliee why do u seem to care now?
"Trumps policy, sell $100k watches 2 months before the election. Wtf."
11 minutes in and they didn&#39;t talk about anything. Can&#39;t waste anymore time. I was actually trying to learn
He didn&#39;t bankrupt the casinos the General Manages mismanaged and caused them to go bankrupt. It&#39;s very expensive to operate and if you just don&#39;t have the volume you&#39;re going to go bankrupt.
Im filipino but That filipino guy runs his mouth like he knows what his talking about!
Bro in the blue hoddie has been drinking that MSNBC cool aid harrdddd 😂
“I’m not yelling “ yea you were hun - when you get loud-you’re yelling
Zion should be removed....shes not fit for civil discussion. Don&#39;t bring her back.
Claims she&#39;s a veteran then called an AR-15 a machine gun 😂😂. Shes a clown
This was a terrible video tbh neither side can agree on one thing or see a middle ground
How this ER physician not advocating for patients regardless of their citizenship.
They need to be fact checked as they go. Embarrassing they still believe media lies
Why would the moderator single her out when everyone is talking??????
Glad to see this comment section isn’t a total mess like some are on Jubilee
California residents would say she was a disaster
Anyone who thinks she has an impeccable record hasn&#39;t looked at her record.
"Zion is so disrespectful, loud AND WRONG! 🤣"
Black woman need to be educated  on politics
"No disrespect to these people, they don’t know what they’re talking about"
Machine guns????? Where ?  They were already banned ages ago
This is America. You single out the black girl for responding the same way as everyone else.
"If these are examples of today’s voters, this country is in trouble."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=519"">8:39</a> --- basically all I heard was &quot;its leviooosa not leviosaaaa&quot; hermoine granger as like let the woman speak ffs"
"She&#39;s a vet, but calls and AR a machine gun 🤣🤦‍♂️"
The mediator in this video needs to let them debate. He sucks
That dude in the blue hoodie definitely still lives with his mother.
Kamala supporters/liberals always take over majority of the conversations with their emotional responses 😩 can we hear both sides equally
W moderator
I hate the whole &quot;I SHOUT OVER YOU THEREFORE I AM TIGHT&quot; crap.
AS WELL IM HISPANIC AND RACIST COMES FROM ALL COLORS OF PEOPLE!
These people are so uninformed and not well researched at all
"Don’t worry bro, not all Filipino voters are like that he/him guy."
Lol &quot;she didn&#39;t lie&quot; &quot;her record is impeccable &quot; so so crazy.
Why are we not talking about Project 2025
They forgot kamala harris been in Congress. What has she done
My lord the Harris supporters are so emotional and angry.
We are being spoon fed lies from both sides.
"I keeping looking for dems that make a sensible, logic-based argument. Its all emotional, brainwashed nonsense. Sure didnt find it in this clip."
The micro agression is crazy
moderator needs to check his bias or they don’t need to be on the show
why does that black girl literally look like that one wojak? lol
The black women was not yelling. Yikes
This Filipino guy is drinking all the koolaid lol
Please do one of these with true undecided voters.
“She came with facts” 😂😂😂😂😂😂. She lied so many times
&quot;America is the greatest country on earth&quot; 🤣🤣🤣
zekiah is kind of delusional and i mean that literally.
The term third world country is offensive to me BRO
I’m a veteran and i support common sense gun reform.
"i hate when the kamala ppl are being annoying and rude like just talk bro, being rude aint helping ur side"
"Why did you only single out the black girl when you can visibly see AND HEAR other people yelling, too???? Very disappointing, Jubliee. The micro aggression was very loud."
bro I just realized that guy had no fingres.
"Lmbo at all of the incoming comments about the “micro aggression”. Give me a break. She and the Filipino guy were very rude. If the moderator was so racist, why didn’t he have to reprimand the BW in the blazer or the BM on the other side?"
the moderator only singling out the black woman…i know what you are.
Can we just get down and who ever falls down loses
That gay dude in the blue hoodie is super beta.
This episode is going to leave on violence
Yup Trumpers are still trumpers
"Im filipino, and we do eat dogs and cats ...😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1407"">23:27</a> so what’s up with EVERYONE ELSE yelling like hello ??? the fact that he did that on camera ?? way too comfortable with that sort of behavior"
"Every jubilee video just rubs me the wrong way, I hate the double standards with women and it was disgusting that the moderator singling out the black woman like she was the only person yelling is crazy to me"
Just came here to say the way the moderator behaves is exactly why I don’t watch this channel
as somone from louisiana we don&#39;t claim that girl
What is Mr. Justin Trudeau doing here 😅
"The way she wasn’t yelling and just talking like EVERYONE else was at the same time. Like why single out a black wonan when everyone was doing that, you’re racist with your damn microagression."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=2193"">36:33</a> this girl lied most of the video, yikes"
That 1 dude said ill be ok I&#39;m white smh
I am Mexican am voting for trump2024 that debate Kamala never said how she will make it better all she say is the same thing that she came from a low class but was getting pimp from a governor back in the day
why are the Harris supporters so pressed?
1 hour of brainrot is crazy
The harris team lost this one smfh.
I wanna see more of Mason he has a very level thought process.
Why did the moderator only address and stop  the black young lady who responded to a question? He didn&#39;t  address anyone else. He should NEVER moderate  again. His BIAS is showing. Disgusting  to see and Jubilee you should do better this is ridiculously cringe and bigoted to see
I can’t listen to this anymore. Honestly bring people that are knowledgeable please.
AR 15 is not an automatic weapon.
These Harris supporters are so ignorant!
Lmao everyone talking about micro aggressions 🤣
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1404"">23:24</a> HAHAHHAHAH she was like &quot;.... bj whose side you on&quot;"
And arguing with the woman’s from Shreveport about guns is ridiculous 😂
Jubilee find a different mod. quickly. QUICKLYYYYYY.
WHAT???? Kamal Harris book is impeccable????
Facts over Feelings ✊🏽
الله يعز السعودية
I feel like they bring these type of individuals on purpose
The guy in the blue … smh 😂
try voters and non-voters
Dude in the light blue hoodie is so irritating.
Zion is a menace
these should be live😭
The border bill was on the table over a year ago.
Unreal.
"Mason, my goat."
I love this debate everyone had a valid points.
This is a debate recap? 😂
That &quot;Physician&quot; is a horrible human beign.
"Zion at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=502"">8:22</a>: “ it’s KA-ma-la” <br>Zion at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=2188"">36:28</a>: “ka-MA-la” 😂<br><br>Also shoutout to John for being completely calm and impartial."
Anyone&#39;s opinions changed after this video?
"The Philippino doesn&#39;t even know what a Historian is LoL....but then again, I don&#39;t expect his kind to really use logic and common sense."
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Most civil political discussion in America
Fact check. Her website had many policies as well as chips act connections for small business as early as 2024 January. She also had policies from 2023 in 2023. She was not selling shirts except for her fundraising site which is different.
That Philipino dude is unbearable I can barely watch the video
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=115"">1:55</a> I find it odd that Jubilee let this guy spew some completely wrong garbage about January 6th without showing a fact check"
&quot;would you say all HAMAS supporters are democats?&quot;
"Fact check: impact of the economics of a presidency generally take 2-3 to flex into place and have impact. Both parts are related to product development supply chains and the speed of government to change. The US is like an aircraft carrier. Land, sea, air and water are all connected to these small cities in the water. To move them is heavily orchestrated and takes several weeks to ensure all protections for all areas are in sync. America is a lot like that. People from other countries have a hard time wrapping their head around just how big we are when they get here. They often wonder how we manage it all with government. The sheer size compared to any other government is impressive. But that means policy changes are not felt for about two years. And some policies stay in place regardless of the administrations want to change them."
Why do people care about the president when it’s the governors that have the power to change your life?
Libs in their feelings LOL. Emotion vs logic.
I love hearing the abortion arguments understand under the same logic weed should be illegal and crime because daddy government said it’s not up to the states . Cute
"i really love jubilee, but the micro aggressions are REALLY NOT needed! people yell over each other all the time in these debates but let’s exclude the BLACK WOMAN who’s using her voice firmly and tell her to pretty much “ calm down” . DISGUSTING and it’s behavior like that where in cases we do have to be more firm in what we say because yall think that whenever a black woman has something to say and it may not align with what you think personal that they’re yelling or angry &amp; THAT is the stereotypical angry black woman comment."
almost a whole half of these people are actual NPC bots
The level-headed vs the people who interrupt everyone😅

The condescending attitude from Zion and Erick is absolutely infuriating
The host kept cutting the blck girl off! She wasn’t even yelling
For anyone watching this.. like reallllyyy watching this.. as a tip.. pause the video.. and really read those fact checks.. take them in.. comprehend them..
"Never fails - every episode - conservatives, calm, rational discussion - leftis  -screaming, rolling eyes, personal attacks. Every.. single.. episode"
I&#39;m 30 min into the video ... can someone from the Harris side explain the &quot;depopulation&quot; ???
I feel like it’s not offensive to say a country that has “dirt cookies” as a cultural food is 3rd world… when you see footage from that country of people cooking other people and eating them… it just seems like they might not be developed…

Guy with the blue hoodie and the black girl are the problems. Really making this unwatchable.
Ground News is probably more reliable for the same service as you advertised
blue sweatshirt guy can only speak in slogans and shallow platitudes.
The light blue guy was crying the entire episode.... He prob had an extra soy frap from Starbucks before this.. the soy is strong in this one

Harris 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙🇺🇲 all the way she hoing win
This cements my thought that society is and needs to collapse. We have reached an intellectual culdesac.
Harris supporters are annoying! Esp the guy wearing the blue hoodie! Not watching until end!
So after seeing how the moderator treated Zion and only pointing her out for yelling Jubilee has lost it. Unsubbing and blocking.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1980"">33:00</a> this woman is a practicing medical physician?? I sincerely question whether she abides “do no harm” by this point of the discussions. To deny a literal global pandemic and vaccine that her candidate took credit on (and he himself took), is harmful as a medical professional."
Zion wants to speak for Harris just state what you want say insted of defending her on everything someone says against her.
Not being able to admit that there are extremists on both sides is insane. Imagine feeling that you are so correct in your beliefs that you are unwilling to acknowledge that there are other people with the same beliefs that take it too far.
I think my one gripe with Jubilee is that when they bring one side in to chat they don&#39;t tell that one side to leave to give the other side their respect to chat their points. I think they should give each side their respected times and then after they make their points both sides could come together and debate on points. which would help to keep the topic on track without distractions.
It&#39;s super disingenuous to say that you dont know what a candidate&#39;s policies are. They are easily accessible to the public. If you don&#39;t see them It&#39;s because you don&#39;t want to see them so you can keep going back to your talking points that the policies don&#39;t even exist.
"I enjoy the concept of these videos, but it seems like the &quot;winner&quot; of the argument is the person who is better at debating. Lots of tactics to catch the other person slipping; often talking over the other, asking classic strawman arguments, etc. It seems like the focus of the debate devolves into who can win the debate, not who has the stronger points.<br><br>Would love to see the 1 conservative in this video debate the 1 liberal in the other video."
The dems need to do some research before having debates lmao that liberal dude needs to look up the definition of third world country. He wasnt saying they are not human smart guy 🤦🏻‍♀️. The fact that 3 of the dems said they would vote dem no matter what their candidate does says A LOT. I am sooooo glad i am no longer part of that party
These are not the only two options out there. You deserve better. A third party vote or a write in means more than sticking to the two party system. Don&#39;t believe the lie that it&#39;s a wasted vote. It&#39;s just not true. Send a message and move away from the two party system.
I hate when people say “it sucks these are the only two choices.”. We did have more choices it’s called primary election. They lost these two won the position!!! Well except Kamala she was just put in there 😂<br><br>Also The lady in the blue sweater is way too emotional. Settle down buttercup
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1531"">25:31</a> well sir why is it cool to give a tax break to those rich ppl that you work for but still charge you real taxes to pay for things that only a few rich ppl could knockout without losing a wink of sleep?"
I would like a journalist to ask about the covering up of Joes mental state everyone on his staff including kamala had to have easily noticed it and covered for him.
"They didn&#39;t need to fact check her in the debate because she told the truth???  What about when she said there were no service men or women deployed in any war-zone anywhere in the world?  Tell that to all the soldiers currently deployed on foreign soil and their families, but she wants to be commander-in-chief."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=3153"">52:33</a> The corruption in financial institutions is the biggest problem in our country. This Kamala dude with the beard is ok with just not voting for someone outside of the two leading candidates that are completely contributing to the problem in his opinion. This is why we get the candidates we get. Have some balls."
"I’ve watched a lot of these videos, and I wish Jubilee would start asking questions that were not so obvious how people will respond. We would learn and come together so much more"
Z helped us out the other one made us look bad getting told to not scream over ppl like show them we can talk without being so threatening an loud sis damn it’s not that hard
The people that come on here have barely have a clue what they’re talking about and don’t know how to argue their points. It’s annoying to watch these sometimes….
"Let&#39;s talk about  the general  Lee statue . These democrats  say that that they  want to get rid of the statue  because  it Represents slavery an they are offend. So why don&#39;t  they  get rid  of the democratic  party  completely  , didn&#39;t  there party  have slaves  an vote against   Lincoln ( Which he is a  republican ) who wanted  to free the slave&#39;s. That statue  needs to stay, it&#39;s history  if you don&#39;t like it don&#39;t look at it don&#39;t go see it or go see it an teach the kids or people  that hey this was a general  ( Which  General  Lee was a democrat)  an teach the kids or people  that  slavery  was bad."
Need a more neutral moderator. It’s sad they can’t just debate among themselves because one side constantly flashes out &amp; has no respect for the conversation and actual debate
"Kamala Harris was invited to speak at the grand opening of the &quot;National Salad Convention,&quot; where lettuce, spinach, and croutons were the stars of the show. As she approached the podium, she smiled confidently and began her speech.<br><br>&quot;Salads, much like our nation&#39;s future, are made of many ingredients. And those ingredients, when tossed together, become... well, more than just ingredients. They become something larger. They become a salad. And this salad, in its togetherness, is a representation of the togetherness we need. Because lettuce is not just lettuce... it&#39;s a leaf. And a leaf, much like life, grows... from a seed. And what is a seed if not the beginning of a salad? And that&#39;s the journey we&#39;re all on.&quot;<br><br>The audience blinked. Was she talking about salads or world peace? No one was sure. Someone in the back held up a piece of romaine as if it would somehow help clarify.<br><br>Kamala continued, &quot;When we think about croutons, we have to ask ourselves... are they just bread, or are they a statement? A statement of... crunch. And we all need that crunch in our lives. And sometimes, when we&#39;re looking for the dressing—whether it&#39;s ranch or, you know, a vinaigrette—we must remember that it&#39;s the dressing that... dresses the salad. It’s the connection that connects us all.&quot;<br><br>By the end, the crowd wasn’t sure if they should toss their salads or start a revolution. Either way, Kamala had made one thing clear: salads were now the new metaphor for everything."
"It’s so sad people use words like “we” when talking about our political parties. We should be very careful about attaching our identity to either side…. We can talk about ideas but none of these politicians are on our side, they are not on our team no matter what side you support. Support ideas, but don’t attach your identity to it using words like we and our side and especially not “I am republican/democrat”"
To do this correctly you need to show both sides the opposite side of the coin show them how media cuts and paste interviews and or use small pieces of video to get ther points across.......
Proud that some of the younger generation are participating in these types of talks however it’s obvious to see that they have not lived long enough to do so. Instead of hearing what they think about the topics it’s more about how they FEEL
She’s a vet and still can’t tell the difference between and AR-15 and a “machine gun”? you don’t need to be talking. It helps in the “hood” but it’s not for that it’s for a Tyrannical government. Plan and simple. More kids died in crosswalks last year than they did an all mass shootings combine. Guess we have to ban crosswalks.
All I see is people making the mistake of attaching their personal identity to a political party and so an attack on the policy is seen as personal attack…. It’s so sad
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1430"">23:50</a> Thank YOU Moderator. I was about to shut it off because I could hear nothing but loud voices trying to talk over one another. I love to see and hear both sides of the isle, to gain a glimpse of both perspectives, but It’s impossible to do this all at once. Each person must have a turn &amp; allow them to be fully heard. Then someone else may speak. <br>I stopped watching the news channels that have several commentators on at once because of this very thing. It’s not cute. It’s most frustrating. Just sayin. 🤷🏻‍♀️😎👍🏻🇺🇸"
Is that girl just gonna keep yapping about kamala sleeping around like the last vid or actually try to say something try to defend her side in this video
I would love to see all parties dissolved.  We the people have put them in office. They are there for us not the parties.
US politics is like a reality TV show. I’m completely hooked and I don’t even live in the US. No other country drags out election campaigns out for months and months and spends obscene amounts of money like this.
"It’s amazing that the immigrants are speaking against immigrants being let into the country, as if they are any better"
And that’s the problem. Every four years you have to pick up the pieces from the last person. Hence why democracy just splits a nation rather than bring it together
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=170"">2:50</a> &quot;Did you know that this is the lowest civilian to combatants death rate in any war in recent history&quot;<br>I laughed so hard I had to replay this few times looking at her straight face :D :D :D :D :D"
"As someone born and raised in the Philippines, I see the term &quot;third world&quot; as a testament to my resilience and gratitude. I always brag about being from a third world country, because it implies resourcefulness and finding joy in simple things. To me, the term isn’t offensive. It may resonate differently for those who haven’t lived in such contexts (eg: the guy in the blue hoodie). Their experiences in a first-world country unfortunately might not fully capture the richness of what &quot;third world&quot; represents."
All this people are failing to realize that non of these politicians give a damn about them instead of fighting each other and defending these people you should be uniting and challenging the politicians.
"Moderator was bias. It’s interesting that the guy in the blue hoodie was yelling the most but he stood up like a teacher talking to a child to check the black woman. My political beliefs aside, I heard decent points on both side but this debate sucked overall"
"I wish people would stop saying an AR-15 is a machine gun, or an assault rifle, or an automatic weapon, or a weapon of war. All of those terms are inaccurate. It’s a semiautomatic just like a handgun. They want all of our guns"
I want to know where the fact check is that you can&#39;t walk around with a machine gun 99% of going owners don&#39;t own a machine gun. Fully automatic rifles is not common in the civilian population.
"If they have a house, they don&#39;t need the aid to get a house. But the real estate rules state that if you &quot;OWNED&quot; a home and it has been five years since you have owned a home, the law places you in the bracket of &quot;first time home buyers&quot;. That is law."
"Don’t feel bad, China and Russia are still second world countries. There’s nothing wrong with being a Third World country and has nothing to do with your race."
The host of the crappy job people wanted to hear what people had to say he tried to control the narrative we need to allow people to deal with the issues
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=3097"">51:37</a> Osiris says first time homebuyer funds don&#39;t help people who were victims of predatory lending in 2008 because they already owned a home. People who lose their homes become first time homebuyers again after 2 years of non homeownership."
The inability of blue jacket and blue hoodie combo to see other sides of arguments is really the issue with people in general. We’ve lost the ability to be empathetic.
"Sheila saying minors can start gender transition without parental consent is extremely misleading. The fact check shows it&#39;s about not &#39;outing&#39; kids to their parents, not medical plastic surgery procedures like she implied. She knows that&#39;s not true and is using her status as a physican to spread falsehoods."
"The opportunity was when a completed border wall was proposed and Dems said no need.  Enough of this, no other country just lets anyone go through and hands those crossing with money, food, and apartments."
"The veteran knows absolutely nothing about firearms. If you make it through 4 years in the military and still don&#39;t understand that an AR isn&#39;t an automatic rifle, she clearly has a pretty shallow learning curve and I wouldn&#39;t trust a word she says."
the difference in Trumps comments on Roe was that he was talking about legislation and his own personal opinion (which does not always align with direction of country) - to me that is a true mark of a US president
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=813"">13:33</a> says he has no problem with people coming here legally through the process…<br><br>….then proceeds to complain and disagree about said people coming over legally through the process ? 😂  😭"
Literally everyone was yelling over each other and in past videos you&#39;ve let people yell over eachother why call out the African american woman specifically?
It&#39;s true there&#39;s video evidence of abortionists and politicians and regular people who have said that abortions can happen up to and after birth.
The proposed border bill was just a small slow down and still allowed 5K a day which just makes those at border to wait an extra day or two until they all get released!!
ITIN is the name the IRS for illegal inmigrantes all in the USA need pay taxes inclusive if you are illegal if not you cant fix your situation migrant
"Zion is annoying. that girl probably has nothing but time lol she sure as anything isnt wasting time learning, just nodding her head any chance she gets"
The gaslighting is hilarious from harris supporters and there is no policy  but main point they didn’t even agree to the lack of a fact check already bad faith clicking off 🙏🏻😊
No…millions of immigrants came here historically documented through points of entry. What is currently happening isn’t happened since…I guess Europeans colonized and pushed the natives out lol
The guy in the blue sweatshirt is very emotional and trying to pass his opinions as factual. The guy in red hat is logical thinker.
Both candidates are crap.  To say his rhetoric is ok is a problem and to say her record is impeccable and pandering is acceptable is a problem
„If I wasn’t born in America I would do the exact same thing as immigrants because we really hit the lottery here” <br>People in Europe watching this like :💀👀
"If your grandparents came into this country as an immigrant, then I feel that you need to keep quiet on the immigration issue. 🤷🏽"
"Only 2 people did mostly the screaming and spoke about feelings and bot facts. Also can&#39;t believe this dude said he&#39;s offended that people call 3rd world countries , 3rd world countries. Also, felt like the mostly edited the Republicans side."
Did she really say that what&#39;s going on in Gaza is NOT a genocide and said it would end 2 days later? does she NOT understand what is really going on in there?
Zion: “ do you know how the industrial prison system works?”<br><br>Zion: “ I support a candidate who actively participated in the industrial prison system… that has nothing to do with her character!” <br><br>Hm?
"Why is that girl in the shorts even there? She provided NOTHING At all! Also, it&#39;s apparent that 90% of these people are clueless. They all just repeat the same things they heard on the media."
next time avoid bringing people like zion and the blue hooded guy to discussions like these bc they let their emotions control em and end up getting so worked up for abs no reason.
&quot;Its hard to go after her record when its impeccable&#39; I cannot believe this woman said that🤣<br>Edit: Half an hour into the video and this African American woman with the suit has the worst opinions
Lmao she has no policy .. she is a horrible lawyer and person .. 😂 wow I mean o wow these people r so brainwashed and they need help
He’s not lying about these people not knowing how to drive😂 my aunts are 60-80 and cousins that are 18 and up and cannot drive! Have you seen traffic in 3rd world countries!😆
"Wait hold on ain’t no way they kinda got offended for the way she pronounced her name, I ain’t even know that was a thing lmaoooo"
"I would love that girl to come live in Chicago and ATL for a year and then tell me her view on guns, because I’ve lived in both."
The veteran girl had to be in the reserves or guard … or just believes she can make 💣 at home bc I don’t understand the lack of knowledge 😅 and the demeanor in which she “argues”
"As soon as Sheila said the civilian death rate in Gaza was the lowest in recent history, I understood watching this video would be a waste of my time."
When the &quot;veteran&quot; said an AR was a machine gun...shows me how much she actually spent with her weapon. She might want to actually learn the difference.
Mason is the only one trying to understand and listen while sticking to his points and I can really respect that
I loved Sheila the most - she was the most well spoken and factual speaker there. I am not gonna even comment on blue hoodie dude
"Ok, I was born in Nigeria and before I came to America I had this idea there would never be equality <br>Any place with diversity will have no equality <br>Fighting who fought a civil to free you is plain evil"
"The people on these shows are very upset.  Whenever someone says, I have mad respect for the others... no, no they dont."
The long haired black girl said it was nobodies business why immigrants went to USA but then questions why people feel they need to defend themselves. Very inconsistent
"supporting a gun ban as a veteran is the craziest thing ive ever heard a veteran say, and im a veteran!"
To say no democrats are talking about taking guns is ridiculous. Harris and Walz both have said they are in favor of gun confiscation
Why do they never bring up the fact that there was a semiautomatic weapons ban from 1994-2004 clearly allowing AR-15’s was not a wise decision
I&#39;d like to see a panel of people like me who are disgusted with both sides AND the two party system from a fundamental level.
"Really need to make a video with Dr Jill Stein’s supporters as well, i know its not a big enough phenomenon but I’m hoping to see most logical answers from them"
Why does nobody bring up the fact that the immigration bill that was voted no on is a democrat wishlist? PUT FORWARD A STAND ALONE BILL AND MAYBE WE WILL PASS IT
"Wait, wait, wait, Tr*mp said at the debate that he still believes the Central Park 5 are guilty."
girl with the glasses was in the plastic surgery video..but she&#39;s saying she works in a county hospital? Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong but aren&#39;t those two different things?
The girl in the jumpsuit is so condescending i can’t take it. Every time she opens her mouth she had an attitude smh 🤦🏻‍♀️
"n the 1960s and 1970s, America was or was at-least VERY CLOSE to being #1 in education. The Department of Education was established roughly 4 decades ago. We are now in the 40s in terms of Education. LET THAT SINK IN."

"The woman is a plastic surgeon talking about gender surgeries, a highly credible source, and the Philippino guy is just rolling his eyes."
"As a server, I owe $1,500-2,000 every year in taxes when tax season comes around, so I have no idea where Mason got that idea at"
When asked about Harris’ policies…it’s promises as opposed to actual policies that go over how those promises would be kept
If she says I&#39;m from Iran one more time. My goodness we get it and I pray for the hospital or clinics she works for.
Filipinos do eat dogs tho. It’s called Adobo. In the US they usually use pork. But I’ve seen and heard of them eating them. I’m from Hawaii.
"Erick has to be the biggest baiter, gaslighter, and arrogant mfr I’ve ever seen on this channel."

No issue being homosexual but this is so clear- he isn&#39;t here for political issue but make you believe that gay black men are mega??
Did i really hear the women say its not a genocide whats happening in gaza ? I think she should change her glasses
That Filipino dude literally said “Amen” to the lady saying as a queer black woman she feel safe under Kamala. What’s there to Amen?
"this fool, she doesnt even realize that most shootings that occur are with handguns and shotguns not ARs"
You guys ever question WHY we have these two choices? It feels like people WANT us to fight and pretend it&#39;s an easy choice.
"That lady that works on healthcare is actually a danger; her moral compass is off, and so much more red flags!"
These Kamala people get so offended and loud lol
It’s really crazy these people act like they need weapons of war to protect their homes lol.

How about putting up the status of the people that ran her out of Iran and says it&#39;s history
I love that the first thing i hear is Jan 6th. It is the ignorants first line of defense.
These black ppl are just going to talk over you instead of listening like everyone else.
Nah these Biden supporters is outta pocket 😂😂💀.  Zakiah is the only smart one in that group
It&#39;s kinda fun when you&#39;re not a strong party loyalist to watch party loyalists debate eachother.
The girl next to the Pilipino guy is beautiful but just confused like a lot of dems
"You should redo this video, but with illegal immigrants. So we can have all laugh"
The girl that said her AR 15 is a machine gun which it is not. She was in the military. I would need proof.
please dont take the woman with the braid ever in the show again she is so problematic
Guy in blue hoodie is your typical Kamala voter 😂
People should be able to keep guns. As ironically as it sounds it does keep us safer.
I hate listening to the media lies repeated over and over. Its sickening.
It’s when he said she was yelling and wanted to end it for me when she wasn’t lol. Smh
When was America the best country in the world? 😅
The beginning of this got me heated already and I haven’t even gotten to 20 seconds 😂
We(Filipinos/chicagoans) do not claim home boy in the Chicago hoodie lol
This is a WEAK panel on both side. The dude in th blue sweater is the LEAST informed.
"how do i sneak into the pool of people they pick from, jubilee ain’t ready for me‼️‼️"
"eric has nothing behind his words, just a moving mouth spewing out random words."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1099"">18:19</a> His face when Sheila said they still came legally got him so angry lol"
Zion is mad annoying and agressive bruh. So glad the moderator called her out.
"I live in a city with a high Latino-migrant population, yea a lot of them can’t drive"
Men lead the house hold not woman in every house so why is this different 😂😂😂😂
"Take taxes off of working hours. If I earned that money, I should be able to keep it."
"i&#39;m Filipino, and erick would eat a lechon aso to prove his a hardcore democRAT 🐀."
Glad my fellow down south LA girl held her own. Although this conversation did become tiring…
Moderators are there to calm the situation so it’s better to be unbiased.
Neither side knows enough to even speak on these issues. Who chose these people?😫
"&quot;I wish we had more options&quot; <br>Fool, you do have more options. You can vote for Jill Stein!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1770"">29:30</a> the lady in the blue suit is living under a rock 🪨 talking of Kamala😅"
"Aneila is gorgeous, and looks like a lot of fun, but Sheila is wife material!"
Are they all at least 25? Curious how this would go with older folks.
"We will never agree this is a waste of time, ill see you at the polls"
About to stop watching these bait videos especially with moderators like this…
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1365"">22:45</a> the idea of “if it doesn’t affect you then why do you care” is wild"
SAN can fact check me but I thought the &quot;Great Recession&quot; was a century ago.
",,we know Kamalas character‘‘ <br>she acts like thats her friend 😭"
Who let that girl back on the talk? She’s as bright as a rock 🪨 😂😂😂
I like how the only fact check one side isn’t that amazing even on this
"As someone who is looking in from the outside, America is a sitcom 😂😂"
lol you can’t go after her record because she was a prosecutor? Insane
"Looks like everyone agrees on one thing, dude in blue hoodie is unstable."
"I would like to say as a fellow Filipino, this guy does not represent me"
There is never any middle ground in political stuff on this show
They are both bad canidates. As a independent this will be hilarious.
"60Million really, why does this number keep going up.  Such a joke she is."
"Ponytail guy is way too sensitive , he’s got too much anger."
Erick (blue hoodie guy) making Filipinos look bad. - i am half Filipino
&quot; im a veteran&quot; completely misclassifies ar as a machine gun
I’m filipino and that Filipino guy is annoying. Why is he so worked up?
Not the middle ground guy saying “we can smoke after this” to Erick 😭😭😂
that samoan dude in the light blue sucks lol
"To that black lady, go to a country that ban guns. STOP YOUR LIES"
I can&#39;t get past the black girl shaking her head in ignorance
I love my Filipino brother and sisters but this guy is a clown.
I just wanna take the time out to say Mason outfit was fresh 💯
Bro in the blue never gone back to the Philippines he should
I’m Filipino and we don’t claim that guy in the blue hoodie.
Jubilee why don’t you fact check the blue side as much as
"Whoever said she&#39;s allowed to question her morality is crazy. Just because you yell doesn&#39;t make you more intelligent. People who yell to get their points across indicate low intelligence. Then having the audacity to say, I&#39;m not yelling, lol, okay."
I like how there is some order being kept a little bit more.
"@ej_regalado <br>John, I am chomping at the bit to participate in a debate on this subject. There is way too much pertinent facts that no one ever brings up! How can I drop some knowledge in the circle?"
"“We don’t have to fact check, if we’re telling the truth…” okay"
I cussed Shiela out so many times during this video. 🥴
The guy with the hoodie doesn’t know how con law works
Lesbian in the blazer is feeling Kamala a lil too much😂
There’s always that one instigator &amp; dude knows who he is.
Trumpsplaining  … this is what he was trying to say .
Easy to see which side is snobby and unreasonable
Sometime these &quot;woke&quot; people be acting &quot;asleep&quot; fr. 😂
Of course the Zionist on this show denies genocide lol
"Can you imagine fighting for American rights, and then coming back to tell Americans what they do and don’t need to protect themselves, what a disgrace of a veteran"
Lmfao the way she said “I’m not yelling!” While yelling
that hard hat seems to be a requirement of some sort
"The bill expanded illegal immigration, not ending it"
But why didn&#39;t they fact check the blue hoodie guy?
Girl now u know we can’t get too passionate 😅
not a genocide? girl what
Kamelas record impeccable 😅😅😅😅😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅
As a veteran..... then calls an AR a machine gun.
I do like that they are being fact checked!
Lol there are videos of her contradicting herself
Bro. They got caught eating the animals!! Wake up
"The lady with the mean tone who says she&#39;s a healthcare worker , should not be working with people at the hospital she sounds untrustworthy"
Look how goofy those Kamala supporters look 😂
U thought harris beat harris take that Hat off
how ur family came here &quot;Legally&quot;? iranina Ma&#39;m?
Lee Paul Williams Kimberly Rodriguez Barbara

I&#39;d be worried if that woman was my physician
filipino brother...CHILL dude
I still didn&#39;t hear one of kamala&#39;s policies ?
Young Sharon Rodriguez Donna Thomas George
Zekiah straight glazing Kamala dear lord..
Anderson Lisa Miller Deborah Martin Laura
Look at the folks on both sides…. Enough said….
i heavily question her morality as well
Blue hoodie guy wouldn’t let anyone talk smh
Baby blue hoodie was insufferable
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1220"">20:20</a> She nailed it."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1123"">18:43</a> hmm who sucked? That’s crazy"
The first prompt and reaction is so telling.
As they watches fight they just sit and laugh
Fact check reminds me of the 3 against 1 debate
That&#39;s an hour I&#39;ll never get back
Third party voters vs. duopoly devotees
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=2858"">47:38</a> you can clearly see who&#39;s truthful"
How are all of them sharing 1 brain cell
They did not let 16 million people in Afgani!
Light blue was dtm but so was the doctor …
How brainwashed are those peoples
Jubilee os turning into a sh** show
Zekiah is an empty slogan machine.
Politics makes children of us all
arguing feelings vs arguing facts
5.53 when I noticed that dudes hand lol
Guy in the blue hoodie was mad emotional
We need more asylum seekers from Iran please.
Why am I arguing with my screen?
The one way fact checking is crazy.
Ok we understand you’re from Iran
In a local election i would vote for zekiah
These Harris supporters are way too crazy
Colorado Native - i agree it’s not the same
Separation of church and state!
Lots of misinformation on Harris here… smh
Zion and blue hoodie are despicable lol
I never voted but im voting for jill stien
"Damn, Chris Pratt has time to do this show…?"
Omg she is a doctor!!! Goodnesssssss😔
"Moderator on that 🐂 💩 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1403"">23:23</a>"
SHEILA... I&#39;M SORRY. SHUT IT!
Do third party vs Harris supporters.
"Both sides completely missed on major subjects.!   There were so many FACTS that could have been brought up.   I have never watched any of these, do they purposely bring people in that are ignorant of the facts for more views?"
I am so glad they brought in a moderator
"I don’t care for either candidate, but why wouldn’t they stop the liberals  from constantly interrupting"
You don’t need a bill to close the border
Americans 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
They need it to have mexican there
This is complete brainrot
what is recreational gun use??
What kind of fact checking is this?
Zion slow af lord bless her heart
JUBILEE THIS IS DIABOLICAL 😂
I need to smoke a joint after that
I grew up in a middle class family and my golden retriever is smarter than a woke liberal.
moderator ruining the video
He was president for four years. Why didn&#39;t he fix the boarder problem then?
"The host is a female, correct?"
hmm the mediator seems bias
"Well, america is doomed..."
Dude please I can’t even
I hate how they all talk over people
Compared to other groups these people were all relatively sane.
“i’m questioning it” 👏🏽
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=540"">9:00</a> womp womp go cry ab it"

Erick has a few screws loose 😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1400"">23:20</a> &quot;I wasnt yelling&quot;"
These fact checks are crazy
Garbage fact checks
I don&#39;t like crack
mod look like anwar hadid
The Dems are emotional
everyone is unbearable
Harris has no policies
these videos are torture
The lady from Iran is condescending
Babylon is over💀
AI still cant do hands!
Dude in the blue hoodie for sure lives with his mom
No words 😳😳😵‍💫😵‍💫
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1905"">31:45</a> THANK YOU!"
Get rid of the jubilee host guy.
This is obnoxious
What&#39;s Aniela&#39;s @
What else was in the bill?
"&quot;US as Americans hit the lottery being born here&quot;, this is what they actually believe 🤣🤣🤣"
Emotions vs logic
Mason my goat
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1823"">30:23</a> lol"
He is lying. Those schools in Chicago  were not turned the ones that were closed were. And the ppl fought back
We&#39;re cooked
"HEY that host purposely singled Zion out. Every time she tried to talk he was only telling, or gesturing HER to be quiet or cutting her off. And then he stood up to talk down to her - not okay."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=395"">6:35</a> booohoo"
it was so amazing how that girl was like &quot;lets just get real. when are you ever gonna need an ar&quot; like thats just too true
&quot;If it was a genocide it would have ended like 2 days later&quot; is such an ignorant thing to say.
Let&#39;s go kami Harris 💙👠💙👠💙👠 she represents your grandmother your mother your sister your daughter your granddaughter 🔵🇺🇲💙👠💙👠💙👠💙 blue 💙💙💙💙 is a guarantee of success well-being progress abundance maximum prosperity and innovation for all middle class not only the filthy billionaires America was built on the middle class from the beginning 👠🇺🇲💙
"As far as guns, better to have and not need than to need and not have. That Zion girl must not have seen world war Z 🤣 I’ll be damned! You don’t know what these politicians got up they’re sleeve. All I see is a Trojan horse tbh 🐎"
Closed ears won’t hear
Funny how one side is always yelling and interrupting the other instead of debating with civility. Not just in this particular debate either...
"This Zion girl&#39;s disconnect from reality, is honestly quite concerning."
Dude in the blue sweater was just a wait of a seat.
lol...ANTIFA?
Ugh
"First, the Philippino dude is not as correct as one make think….. THERE ARE MANY PHILIPPINO FRIENDS that I know are doing very well. Nobody that I know would say the things that you are saying. Maybe you have your own personal issues. Calm down brother.  Stop being racist."
Cats
"Yeah. The guy in the blue sweatshirt, pls don&#39;t ever invite him back."
"As a Filipino, we are disowning blue hoodie guy."
Anelia ❤❤
Zion is damn fine
Harris/ Walz 2024 for a sane  and decent 🇺🇸. 💙👍
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1784"">29:44</a> Now she’s onto something lol America is a company … 👀"
Erick soy😂
How do you complain about criminals entering the country while trying to elect one for president
Terrible panel. Both sides.
Handguns are for protection against other citizens.  Rifles and machine guns are for militia or protecting yourself against your own government in the event they have become corrupt.

"There talking about not erasing history,  did the Trumpets forget the bab in books that the Republicans are trying to do ..smfh.. vote Kamala Harris. And one more thing it does matter how her name is pronounced,  I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t want your name to be said wrong 😂"
moderator was ON POINT. I loved this format. This was one of my favorite debates and I was able to actually hear everyone for once lol (Blue hoodie was the only one that I thought was more emotional and not factual.)
"It doesn’t matter how people pronounce Kamala Harris’s name. it’s 🇺🇸. freedom of speech,  if anyone has a problem  with that then they don’t believe in the first amendment."
Notice how the people on trumps side are respectful and reserved in their emotional outbursts.
😂😂😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=1330"">22:10</a>"

😮
this is so sad. project 2025 has nothing to do with Trump.I felt this channel is super bias and that makes me sad. I&#39;m unsubscribing and no ;longer supporting this channel. its sad because I really liked it
I live around and have met more immigrants where I currently live.  They have NEVER hurt me or been rude or disrespectful.  They work and are friendly AND the crime where I live is not from Immigrants.
But y’all do eat dogs?
That black lady said &quot;It&#39;s hard to go after her record when she has been impeccable&quot; That girl is high af lol
I lost it at &quot; her record is impeccable&quot;. Life would be easier if i was this  uneducated
TRUMP2024<br>TRUMP2024<br>TRUMP2024. <br>80 Million of us voting in November.
OMG this scares me for the future of our country
Anyone not from America but wasting 1hr watching this<br>👇🏽
I lost it when she defended calling Kamala “kaMAla” as if she’s still correct to pronounce it wrong. I say we just start calling him Donald Tramp until they get the message. Who’s with me.
Did that girl see what Kalama has done in San Francisco?
Kamala 24’💙
Young Steven Walker Joseph Martin Melissa
Girl is a vet and doesn’t know that an AR-15 style rifle is NOT a machine gun😂
are we not going to talk abt the girl saying that the genocide isnt a genocide???
"Does anybody know the name of the Filipino guy in blue sweatshirt? Kabayan, masyado ka naman emosyonal. Ano ba ipinaglalaban mo? LOL ;-)"
Never have Erik on again lol
Blue Hoodie guy is a toddler
"The way the Republican party is so welcoming to, and depends on white supremacists is why I could never support them, but besides that the problem with both sides is that at some point we have to recognize that you never have a winner without having a loser. Whoever wins has to really start going out of thier way to also help the other side, and not leave them out."
They said the same about black people not contributing to this American economy country. Study your history so we will not repeat it. Because we not going back.
"The  difference if  Democrats  spending Government  Money, to help the Poor &amp; middle class.  is this. They Help Pople, &amp; Build infrastructure projects .<br> The Republicans  waste  Government  , money on frivolous things. . &amp; Party a lot with the     Wealthy . &amp;  Fornier&#39;s   ."
I REALLY feel like jubilee purposely structured this video on the Lefts side 😂 i seen too many cut off clips of when someone on the rights turn to talk 👀
Trumpers will literally say anything bruh lol. True or not. It doesn&#39;t matter. As long as whatever they are saying uplifts trumps and puts down everyone else.
"That Zion girl who keeps using her veteran status as some sort of subject matter expert is really annoying to listen to. Let&#39;s be real on her &quot;deployments&quot; she more than likely was never outside the wire. She said she had fewer rights when she came back, haha......please stop that stupidity.  Most of us just say thank you and don&#39;t advertise our service."
Where do ppl buy those little cute hands?! I can&#39;t find then anywhere
"The Border Bill WAS NOT A BORDER SECURITY BILL. Read it. The Bill is for $181 billion, but only $20.2 billion is for the Border. $60 billion goes to Ukraine, $18 billion goes to Israel, $10+ billion goes to foreign aid, and the rest goes to military operations in Africa and special projects by certain members of Congress. The $20.2 Billion for the Border is mostly for administration, legal aid for immigrants, judges, and interviewers to talk with immigrants -- AND ALL OF THEM, the Bill says, CAN NOT BE LAW ENFORCEMENT. So grow up, kids, and stop believing that the major media is telling you all the truth. The young Black girl who said she was a veteran and built bombs and she doesn&#39;t need to walk around with a machine gun --- she is a liar. An AR is not a Machine gun, and if she does not know that --she is clearly a liar."
why should anyone have to contribute their work (healthcare) to people who didn&#39;t contribute to the system?
The lady that works at healthcare really said &quot;These people&quot;? WOW.....
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxFZGuVxaMk&amp;t=922"">15:22</a> Republicans always go on about Vets needing to be taken care of first, but <b>never</b> propose any legislation whatsoever to help Veterans."
"This Zion lady pissing me off referring to an AR-15 only as a machine gun, which are legal to own to any citizen if it was made before May 19, 1986 or if you have the proper FFL. Just felt like I needed to add that before people start chiming in"
"How high would you rate the smugness of the girl condescendingly asking the lady who legally immigrated to the US from Iran how illegal immigration is affecting her, while also complaining about the fact that her own ancestors that she&#39;s never known were slaves 150 years ago?"
The black guy wearing a “make American great again” is the most hilarious thing I’ve ever seen 😂😂😂😂😂
NPC
"One side is extremely emotional, passionate yes, however severely misguided in how to conduct a debate or simple conversation in general. The other side has open ears &amp; calmly expresses their thoughts. If both sides could respect the others points and then calmly respond, this could have been the episode of the decade, however, it’s just a show to why America is the way it is rn."
The female &quot;veteran&quot; sounded like she read the comics all day and spouted things in an inane fashion. Check her 9.1 percent claim and then the fact check. My opinions and my take.
"Need to get more informed voters, all 8 of these participants knew very little to nothing about the facts of the last eight years! Very frustrating to watch both side of the argument poorly and unintelligently debated!"
people who say weed is their medicine are ridiculous..
The military &quot;veteran&quot; doesnt know what&#39;s a machine gun
Libtars with emotion and reb with logic 😂
She said that Kamala is impeccable 🤡🤡🤡
working class isn&#39;t voting for Harris....
I can’t stand Harris and her supporters

I love every thing about this video
"I&#39;m amazed by the fluid animation, but I&#39;m also very scared at how expensive this must&#39;ve been."
This is unprecedented levels of perfection how.
Ain&#39;t even a furry but I got such mad respect for the animating skill LupisVulpes displayed and that displayed by everyone they inspired.
Perfect!!! 👍
Everyone: bout’ to send this to my boyfriend/girlfriend <br><br>Me: <b>crying alone... but vibing along to the beats and enjoying this animation</b> <br><br>I love how I still have the video saved even though I still can’t find a girlfriend
Even though the message wasn’t for me I still felt better
Fundy be like:<br><br>Sorry lmao-
"This is perfect, perfect, wouldn’t change a thing about it."
When the creator is only hearting the verified accounts:(
Not only is this whole video so cute it&#39;s sickeningly sweet but the animation is of prelesional quality. It is not common to find animation this smooth and this detailed on YouTube.

"This video is truly perfect, wouldn’t change a thing about it."
This is the greatest thing I&#39;ve seen ever!!
"I love this! I looked at the song and the artist, and now I have an album I really like, too! Now that I&#39;ve heard the full song I can tell where the audio cuts and it takes away from the video a little bit, but it&#39;s still adorable as heck. I love the facial expressions, and in general the animation is really expressive and adorable :3"
"This is &quot;Perfect.&quot;<br><br><br><br><br>I&#39;m Sorry for the Pun, But it is."

The fact that people are hating on this is wild. 💀
"I&#39;m not a furry, but this is GOOD. Think of all the effort put into this! (Also, I don&#39;t understand why people hate furries. They never did anything bad)"

"Imagine your at school normal day you go to your classroom, sit down and look at your book you start writing but then you feel drowsy your eyes start to close...you look up and...and... everything is different (its a parallel world where everone is there furry equivalent of themselves and humans dont exist) you look to your right and what your parallel &#39;furry&#39; freind is looking on his book (by this point your starting to freek out) your parallel freind looks up and sees you...he stops and stares...he starts to freek out he jumps out his chair you start to freek out and suddenly the whole classroom freeks out... now...what would you do?"
MY HEART JUST MELTED AND IS REACHING BOILING POINT
This video was my furry awakening lol :)
He looks so confident.<br>I wish I could be like this.
Every time I see this in my recommended... I click and watch it again.

"I’m back a year later after watching this and, we’ll this video made me a furry thank you"
"I can’t even describe my love for this video. It’s so good! The animation is smooth, it’s an amazing song. And may I mention how adorable this is"
THE FLOFF GODDAMN THE ANIMATION IS PERFECT!!!
This song gets stuck in my head all day
"With the fact that most frames had to be individually drawn, I am REALLY impressed with the effort! This is not something you see on a regular basis, and that&#39;s the amazing bit!"
I don’t think I could EVER express how ADORABLE THIS IS-
Do I here the Underated animator alarm? <br><br><br><br><br>Yep
"Everything about this, it&#39;s just... Perfect!<br><br><br>see what i did there?"
Im sending this to my bf right now-
"Told myself I have one video left to watch before homework, glad it was this one that I clicked on! You really thought about how your character expresses their personality in their movement! Great job!"
Its so god damn cute have been watching this for 5 hours now
Ngl this video is probably how I started watching furry animation type videos. I can’t get over those fluffy tail animations XD
"Wow, that animation! So good. The lip-synching was on point and so smooth, and the characters moved so nimbly but felt like they still had weight to them. Props &lt;3"
The fact this meme is perfectly animated is just ironic-
"I love the lipsink, it&#39;s like its so much that he opens his mouth sooo wide uwu"
That was the best thing I&#39;ve seen all day. And it was so FREAKIN cute!
I love this. It&#39;s perfect.<br>Ok. I didn&#39;t realize what I did untill I posted this comment.
"This animation is the perfect mix of smooth handed line work and a touch of tweening, it&#39;s such a satisfying video to watch the timing hit every beat."

This animation is PERFECT<br>It was made for me
This video is amazing. It&#39;s so cute and the animation is great! This video was actually my inspiration to even <b>start</b> animating! This will always be my fav. Thanks so much for inspiring me.
"It is wonderful! Meme is beautiful and the characters are so cute: 3. You definitely need to like it! Sorry that the words do not match, I&#39;m just Russian, and I do it in a translator ... But the meme is still 👍"
can we talk about how dang smooooooth this animation is?<br>This smoother than japanese cheesecake<br>Also the way the white fox was just like &quot;I am so fed up with this guy&quot; was PRICELESS
I see my supper
"My literal favorite animation meme so far! Amazing job! I love your commissions so much! You always make them so cute and happy, and put way more work than you need to in them! Keep up the great work!"
"I feel like more and more animation memes are becoming wholesome instead of traumatizing their OC&#39;s, and I like that"
"Wow..a month…that is so long. You deserve ten times more recognization then you are given. Not to mention, you probably sat for hours just animating. This is wonderful work- I would give my life to have this kind of patience 😂"
Can you do this but do a black wolf or lynx? Sorry if I&#39;m asking for a lot! Btw it&#39;s amazing :3
"Love this, I watched this about 1000, 00000, 000 times by now but this meme never gets old, just like all of your animations, this is absolutely amazing!<br>👍✨"
Who else wants to pet him? 💀❤️✨
"I sent this to my girlfriend (I&#39;m a girl) she absolutely loves this, we both agree its adorable! Also your art is amazing!"
This is so freakin cuuuute❤
my bff sent me this and i feel very loved
"Q: Is there such a thing as too cute?<br><br>A: No, there will never be too much cute. :3"
This is literally so cute omfg
The fact I saw a fox video before this
I love how they trip. It just adds that little extra touch of attention too many animations miss.
"You can really see the effort put into the animations here, please never stop doing this"
"I love this so much, this literally inspirations me so much. ;3; The characters, the animation flows, and how it fits it all. &gt; 3&lt; Def gonna make a meme out of this, I&#39;ll link to you when it&#39;s done. ♥ P.s new to your channel and I subbed, your characters are so adorable! ♥"
"if there was one video I could watch every minute of my life, it&#39;d be this"
The mouth is perfectly inSync I love it
Title: perfect meme<br>Me: yes it’s a perfectly beautiful meme
"Im going too die from cuteness uwu <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CoNcDTiCKQ&amp;t=30"">0:30</a>"
You inspired me a bit ago and now im a full time animation creator
I REMEMBER WATCHING THIS WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT! TIME FLIES BY SO FAST
Its been a long time since I’ve seen this meme
perfect
"ES HERMOSO, la animación es perfecta, la música, el video es perfecto 🥺"
Holy smokes did a familiar face just popped up in my recommendations-<br>Duuuude I used to follow you a couple years ago when I was having an animation meme phase and geezus...how much you’ve improved sense then is inSANE<br>I can’t stop rewatching this it’s blowing my mind
"WAAHHHH, SORRY I&#39;M LATE, THIS IS SO ADORABLE"
I was reading pax at the time I saw this and I feel like it kinda reminds me of pax!
This is so cute
This is UNREASONABLY well-animated.
"It&#39;s a furry canal?<br>Okay, I like furry.<br>I admit that I like furry, without offending. This is the first furry channel that I am going to follow, and I will never show it because all my friends hate furry, call me weird, although I am for my friends, Even if I speak Spanish, I understand English and I know how to write in this language.<br>Inside I love furry<br>Vinkelext"
"My ahh who can’t animate for the life of me (I can animate, I’m just awful at it) who can only dream about doing this: 👁️👄👁️"
"I could watch this for hours and hours, this is an amazing video condensed into 50 seconds, and an inspiration for what I hope I can pull off one day. truly an amazing video."
I like the part where sam cuts of the foxs arm with his mursama
"I searched up sad music, and this showed up-???"
This was the first animation meme that I ever saw and it got me into the community.<br><br>So nostalgic!
THERE WILL BE BLOOD
"the animation is so smooth..<br><br>wait HEY, NO IM NOT CRYING BECAUSE OF HOW GOOD THIS IS YOU DIDNT SEE THAT"
"Truly amazing,I love how smooth and  bouncy the animation is"
Standing here                                                                                                                                           <br>I realize<br>You are just like me<br>Trying to make history<br>But who’s to judge<br>The right from wrong<br>When our guard is down<br>I think we’ll both agree<br>That violence breeds violence<br>But in the end it has to be this way<br>I’ve carved my own path<br>You followed your wrath<br>But maybe we’re both the same<br>The world has turned<br>And so many have burned<br>But nobody is to blame<br>Yet staring across this barren wasted land<br>I feel new life will be born<br>Beneath the blood stained sand<br>Beneath the blood stained sand
I love this so much. I can’t not watch it whenever I see it recommended to me.
I love everything about it the editing and the meme itself the song just goes well with the animation and I think it’s really nice😊
It’s a masterpiece
Friend: “How many times have you watched this?”<br>Me: “yes”
Now that’s a pretty meme! Exquisite!
"Best animation ever, I&#39;m literally putting this on loop.<br><br>its just PERFECT"
The lil ear movements are EVERYTHINGGGG ❤
I could definitely say that this animation really matches the name!
"&quot;It&#39;s beautiful, i&#39;ve been looking at this for 5 hours now&quot;<br><b>me rn</b>"
"I saw this video when I was sick a year ago, I had a very bad stomach ache and they thought it was appendicitis, but in reality it was just anxiety, and I started scrolling YouTube to distract myself and the first video that came out was this &lt;3 were three in the morning and then it became one of my favorite animations &lt;3"
Literally my favorite animal<br>If i was a furry a fox would be my oc

"every time I open up YouTube this is on my recommendation list, but to be honest, I don&#39;t mind at all. this animation is to wholesome to say no to. Will forever brighten up mah day for eternity and all the journeys into the bottomless pit. YouTube you better not delete this animation later on in life or I&#39;ll Smite you. Never ruin the happiness this animation brings to everyone and to me especially."
How many times have you watched this?:<br><br>Me:YES

This is just.... Perfect.
I can’t find it on Spotify someone help me please
THE ANIMATION STYLE IS LITERALLY ADORABLE I LOVE IT SO MUCH
"Ive been watching this every time I get tired and take a break from my work, I recently got dumped and this is the last good memory I had with them, listening to this song. It&#39;s a bittersweet feeling."
this is exactly what people should send to their friends-
this is literally the only video I’ve seen that u have made and I’m subbing already
"This is amazing, the detail and how it’s just put together! Those people who disliked don’t know your hard work."

Im screaming at how good this is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I have exclamation marks for days ÙwÚ
1 year ago in summer I would always watch this at night and this was the time I was introduced to animation memes I loved it so much and still do
"&quot;Perfect, perfect! Never seen a thing just like you!&quot;"
"It looks like my Roblox skin and I&#39;m a YouTuber if it&#39;s me, thanks :)"
This is the video that got me by surprise and eventually got me interested into the furry fandom. I love this video and I can&#39;t stop dancing when it&#39;s in my head!
just saying im currently watching this on a server with 192gb of ram
okay so can we talk about how smooth the animation is?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CoNcDTiCKQ&amp;t=44"">0:44</a> What a cute horn :3"
"Every animation I&#39;ve seen with that character, they have one of (if not the most) chaotic faces I&#39;ve seen and I&#39;m here for it"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CoNcDTiCKQ&amp;t=39"">0:39</a> 𝙸 𝚑𝚎𝚊𝚛𝚍 &quot;𝙹𝚎𝚜𝚜𝚒𝚎 𝚊𝚗𝚍 𝚆𝚊𝚕𝚝&quot; 𝚏𝚛𝚘𝚖 𝚋𝚛𝚎𝚊𝚔𝚒𝚗𝚐 𝚋𝚊𝚍 🥲😭★☆"
The animation flows so nicely.
The animation.. the character design… this animation meme truly <b>IS perfect</b>
this is it.. this is what i wanna achieve with my own art
Why walk on all fours when you can walk on all four levels of 😈hell😈
maybe being  furry isnt that bad
No father
Ahhh. Who else watches this just to see the walking animation in the begining??  its SO GOOD!!
This is what I was thinking about during period one today💀🤭
"The title was right it is Perfect, no random sketches, no lines out of place, takes the song lyrics to consideration, the art style is awesome, the animation was smooth, and the drawings are just out of this world! It’s awesome! The real question is how long did this take- ❤"
I LOVE THE PART WHERE HE FAILS TO JUMP IT&#39;S SO CUTE SNSBSUSBAHJDHS
"YouTube really knows what I like, got this video 6 times in a row in my recommended."
You don&#39;t have to be a furry like the animating that is good
The expressions are just- and the smoothness—<br><br>….<br>One word.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Perfect.
Whoever sung this did a great job!
I swear this is one of those videos that lives in my head rent free
Sometimes it&#39;s nice to watch these to remind me when times were simpler
how to tell someone you have a crush on them without telling them you have a crush on them:
People in 2024<br>👇
"This is a great, adorable little animation.<br><br>In fact, I think I&#39;d go so far as to say it&#39;s...<br><br><i>Perfect</i>"
Howww do you draw like that?! That&#39;s my DREAM style!!?
"Lol I&#39;m so late to say this, but the animation itself is ✨Perfect ✨"
"warning, your chances of me hugging you have increased from 90 to 100"

Ютуб: о давай это тебе попадётся в реки через 2 года?<br>И это шедевр!
"Fun fact, there’s actually a meaning behind the red string. In Japanese culture we call this 運命の赤い紐(unmeino-akai-himo), which means the red string of faith. This string is a string that is believed to be tied on one of our fingers and the string will eventually lead to another person’s finger, which is basically your soulmate. No matter what happens in life, the string should hold together and you will eventually be with your soulmate. But what probably happened in this animation is that the soulmate was gone, out of this world because the string was cut off and there was blood. This really shook up my emotions."
"Perfect is this fox, and the artist"
i remember this bro!! yt algorithm likes recommending me old videos 😭😭
I LITTERALLY REMEMBER TRYING TO TRACE THIS IN FLIPACLIP IN 2021 💀
La practica hace al maestro 🧐🧐

My sister asks how I became a furry when this is the stuff she showed me when I had a Nedo brain
your animation is so amazing! i wish i could do that
Wow so adorable❤this is PERFECT! animation! ❤
This animation is awesome but the song nothing wrong with the song by a stand point it’s more of a me problem but I can’t hear the song without crying because it reminds me of dating and that well I would say they were perfect for me and they ended up being a predator and I Really did love them
"im going to incinerate your video now in an edit due to cringe, but still, your animation skill is really high and admirable."
It&#39;s 2024 now but i still somehow enjoy this
The fact that it looks like my fox theriotype is kinda scary and cute

STOPPPP @Stareevee VIBES
I remember watching this 3 years ago.
man this is so cute 😭
That fox looks just like my furrsuit
There should be more credit for the blinking animation. The way the eyes refocus for a split second after blinking is so realistic!
This is amazing
Really fluant animation
cute! :3
This is so well done
The youtube algorithm just recommended this to me.  That audible :D was hilarious in between the verses xD
This is cute I love it
AAAAAA ITS LITERALLY SO CUTE But do you mind telling me the app u animate??Its just so good
CUTEST THING IVE LITERALLY EVER SEEN
I use this thing for a Google slide for me and my friends called gaming foxes and I literally use the cover of this video for the cover of the slide
AWWW THIS IS AMAZING (๑•ᴗ•๑)♡ ⭐⭐⭐
¿Como se llama la musica?
I love FOXES!!!🥹
I REMEMBER WATCHING THIS YEARS AGO AND LOVING IT SO MUCH<br>I’m actually so glad I found this- it’s so smooth and cute and awesome
This is probably the first animation meme i ever watched. Amazing.
STOP WATCHING THIS BROTHER<br>WE MUST FIGHT THE MPLA-Jonas Savimbi
Now this is definetly better than those animator who would do 50$ for tweening animation!!! (Ironically i do tweenings too. But i dont sell them for dollars)
Do you still take commissions?
If this is a fox then this is the best video ever posted on YouTube in the entire world you’re so cute and you should get infinite subscribers for this
Perfeito
What do u animate on
ITS SO CUTEEE I saw one rockruff version y&#39;all should see it :3
I love these so much I do have a suggestion tho could u do one with a pit bull:)
I remember watching this when it came out and I’m still watching it 3 years later
3 years later still one of my favorite animations
God I adore this &lt;3
Love it so much!
"So smooooooth! I love this, I love foxes, and I don&#39;t see stuff like this often, it makes my day!"

Nobody:<br><br><br><br>Absolutely nobody:<br><br><br><br><br><br>My dumb a$$:<br>FUNDY!?

This IS perfect bc foxes are my fav animals❤❤❤❤
WOW
Thanks for the free animation😂💀
Would it be okay I I would make Maskes based of the Charakters?
This reminds me of Todd when he met the female fox (I forgot her name) in the fox and the hound
I WISH I COULD DRAW LIKE THIS I WOULD NAME THIS FOX DEXTER!!!!!!
I love this ❤❤❤
Tbh the one with the white fur would be my attitude if someone would be annoying me
"3 seconds in, and I&#39;m screaming: SO CUUUUUUTTE!!"
P E R F E C T ! A N I M A T I O N ! L O V E  U R  A R T  S T Y L E !!! A A A A A A A A
HELP I KEEP GETTING RECOMMENDED THIS CRINGE AH TYPE SHIT
This is still one of my favorite animations you&#39;ve ever made. :D
"I feel like a copy cat rn a lil bit bc my OC or persona OC whatever it’s called is a fox and has a red bandanna, they don’t really look the same by much but still-"
Great job! :D this Animation is really smooth. U have skills. 😊
"I remember sending this to my now ex being like, “this is me talking to u in the morning!” At like midnight.. The person sent hearts back yet ended up cheating on me sooooooooooo"
Can someone find the lyrics for this?
"<b>this.. . . (warning, do NOT click if ur a kid...)</b> 🤮🤢 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2605ym5yp5Y"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2605ym5yp5Y</a>"
who else checks on this channel every few months just to make sure he is alive.
whos here after he got skinny?
I got scammed by the nikocado avocado glowup video
I don’t think he let her in on the plan😭
You are a real motivation to avoid junk food
Bruh she running out of breath while sitting 😭😭💀💀💀
"This channel is the great inspiration for me to workout as often as i can and eat healthy, thanks"
We got skinny nick avocado before gta6
Hearing her struggle to catch her breath from mixing is genuinely depressing.
Who else just genuinely wants to see him turn his life around and be healthy and happy
These are the only two Mukbangers who don’t make me hungry
<b>two steps ahead….</b>
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ocpS7flaI&amp;t=955"">15:55</a> she&#39;s out of breath just by mixing that shit💀💀💀 lord have mercy"
"Nick, you are my motivation to work out, thank you 😊"
Props to that sofa
Whos here after his 2 steps ahead <br>👇
That TikTok was a LIE. 💀💀💀💀
i thought he was losing weight 😢
So everybody is here ?
I hope she also follows on his steps
oh the tik tok was a lie ..
Did anyone else come from the one tiktok to see if it was telling the truth or not😬
Why does this feel like it belongs on the dark web…. Such blatant self harm disguised in the most taboo innocent way but at the root it’s dark and sinister
This is blowing my mind
Who came after 😂 watching his bulk edit 😂😂😂
Who comes here after seeing the fitness edit videos of him😂
I THOUGHT HE WAS LOSING WEIGHT???
who watched this after the villian arc video
The fact she outa breath just mixing the noodles is scary
Anyone else come from tiktok to see if he actually lost weight😭
If only the TikTok was real… 😔
The fact bro managed to.fool all of us
Who is here from TikTok who actually taught that Nikocado is now losing weight?
This is pretty fucking sad… You’re literally watching someone commit suicide on the instalment plan.
Why they saying he lost weight bro
Like this comment if you just watched 2 steps ahead.
Why they lie about him losing weight…?
This is just prolonged suicide 😢
How many people came because of that bulk and cut short vid
"No but this is actually fucking crazy, the whole internet has been reset"
"I was feeling down, lazy and didn&#39;t want to go on my run tonight.....but after seeing this?? I&#39;m gonna run my ass off. Scary scary stuff."
How in the fuck is she still alive
I thought this guy was losing weight.
Aint no way this whole thing was a social experiment.
Use me as a WTF button
I came here from TikTok to see if they were lieing they were…
Bro i thought you lost weight
Poor girl. She&#39;s two steps behind
Wth i thought that these glow up short vids about Nikocado Avocado were real 😭
"I come here to watch his videos every once in a while , when ever i lost motivated to workout . He&#39;s actually inspired me to not become like him . Very good motivation video 💪💯"
Heres my dumbass to check if the &quot;weight loss video&quot; was real 😂
Ok now I’m waiting for her glow up.
"I had a friend that was obese. Somewhere in the middle of these two.<br>My friend at one point gave up on losing weight and started to accept her body like it was. She was even a model for a&quot;all bodys are beautiful &quot; campain.<br>And then with 31 she just died in her sleep. Because of her weight.<br>She had so many plans for her life. She wanted to live. She knew her weight wasnt  healthy, but she never expected it to kill her at this age.<br>What I am trying to say... As long as you want to live, never give up on yourself!❤"
Omg her heavy breathing while she mixes noodles😭😭😭
"My uncle just died yesterday from an intestinal tumor at the age of 67, he always conduced a healty life, always ate good we are italians, and seeing people like in this video show me how cruel life is"
This is beyond mental comprehension. What is real. What is reality.
People checking if he&#39;s still alive<br>👇
I thought bro was losing weight<br>Edit: 15 likes already????
I come here every month just to see this guy if hes alive or not
I bet shes mad about his transformation😂
she was heavy breathing even for mixing the sauce... we are watching 2 people killing themselves... also who the hell gave them 21.000 likes?
Keep on losing the weight and don’t give up! We’re rooting for you nick!
Why TikTok saying you lost weight 😭😭
Anyone else notice how he kept putting random clips of him skinny in there? I think it was a hint at what he was about to drop yesterday. I cant believe he lost 200+ lbs!!! I guess lets see where this goes
This helps me stay on my diet and workout. Thanks Niko ❤
This makes me physically sick.
Who here came from the nikocado avocado glowup vid?
"Waiting to she her transformation next, wonder how she feels right now lol"
"She is breathing hard, just from stirring the noodles 😮"
Shame on all of you encouraging this guy to fasten his death
this is genuinely sad
Whos watching aftrr the crazy reveal 😧
Who else is checking his channel to see his weight loss journey but can’t find nothin 🤣
Me who came here who thought that he already went to the gym and lost weight
"Pov: ur checking either to see if hes alive, or if he really lost weight"
Bro was 2 steps ahead.
Sad as fuck
she&#39;s 2 steps behind 💀
Whoever came from that tt vid
I love how everyone came over to this video after the reveal
Who&#39;s here after the new video?<br>👇
Who came to check if he lost weight
What about the woman I hope she’s 4 steps ahead
She has difficulty breathing while stirring the ramen 😭😭
who else are from tiktok nd went to his yt channel to see if he really lose his weight?
2 steps ahead…
He got skinny guys !!! 😵‍💫😵‍💫
i come to check if he got skinnier 🤣
I watch his channel as motivation to NOT look like him.
I thought bro was losing weight
Anyone in 2024 september?
I thought he was losing weight 😢
Bet yall feel stupid now 😂 2 steps ahead...
Dawg I thought you were losing weight. Not gaining it 💀
So we’re just all here?
This was recorded ages ago.
Am I the only one who checks his channel to see if he’s still alive
Is it me or she&#39;s breathing too hard looks like she&#39;s tired of mixing it
I thought he was losing weight lol
Are we going to see this girl losing weight? Then she will say - I am three steps ahead.😂😂
i wonder how she feels today.
BRO İS TWO STEPS AHEEEADD WHAT THE FUUUUUUUCK
Two steps ahead
Everytime when I’m on a diet I watch him so I can see the consequences of eating (please say that I’m not the only one)
So everyone is here huh
Why would you post this while she’s trying to change her life right now? What a great friend you are
<b>goes to channel</b><br>Still alive? Okay<br><b>clicks off</b>
Bruhhh she’s getting tired just stirring the noodles up 🤦‍♀️
Honestly Nick start a weight loss journey we would all support you and watch your videos.
bro did not lose no weight 🙏💀
Girls transformation is also coming soon 👀
I thought this Mf was meant to be losing weight
So proud if him lost 250 pounds!!!
i honestly feel so bad for these people. it’s disgusting seeing them not even try to lose weight but motivate each other to gain more. and them getting out of breath just by mixing in noodles and standing up for more than a couple seconds just makes me sick.
Who come after transfarmation😂
I thought he lost weight😢
Cant imagine he lost more than 200+ lbs💀
When will she lose weight
Her moaning and deep breathing is worst on an airpod 😢
She are two steps ahead too?
“ALWAYS TWO STEPS AHEAD”
whose here from the vid he posted of losing weight<br>👇🏻
Listen her grunting just mixing up the noodles??? Lmao...good lord
when he dies his soul would try to go to heaven but ultimately he will be pulled down by his weight
"She’s getting exhausted by mixing the noodles, while nick has always been two steps ahead…"
Who else is wondering if the chick is also losing weight
i found the shredded ver of him... and i thought that was real 😢
I checked to see if he was still losing the weight
He looks thin next to her 🤣
I&#39;ll be bamboozled if she got skinny too
All these comments have aged terribly 💀
the best plot twist
You need to turn your channel from mukbangs to a weight loss and health journey. I’m sure you could inspire lots of people to become healthier with this platform
Whos here after the weight loss video? 👇
He was always two steps ahead of us…
So we are all here 😭
"Tbh, I thought Dawg was losing weight 💀 hope he doesn&#39;t die."
Nikocado Avocado I thought you were losing weight 😥
"Wut, wtf I came here because I wanted to see the transformation lmao"
Use me as a WTF button<br><br>👇
I just check on him to see if he&#39;s Alive💀
Who else thinks this is tragic?
Who checks his channel everyday or every week too make sure hes alive<br>                                                           👇
Does she lose weight too???
Tought bro was having a transformation💀
Tik tok said this man was skinny now idk why in tf I believed it .
Wonder if she lost weight
What if he’s not 2 but 4 steps ahead and he’s not Skinny but a whole body builder
Use me as &quot;WTH&quot; button
"Nick , i dont know you but i want you to know that people care about you , we just you to be happy :) self care is hard and as an ex drug addict myself i fully understand why you are doing this which is just to feel better. Just know if you want to , and when you are ready a lot of people will be happy to see you more healthy and happy ! Take care nick and dont let the world get you down. You are loved. ❤️"
This is absolutely disgusting 🤢 and the fact that YouTube allows this is irresponsible and wrong
Bro this is insane
The size of her arms never ceases to amaze me.  The sheer weight of them must be exhausting.
Who else  came here to see if it was really him in that Gym edit where he lost Hella weight
What  happened to that parrot. You ate it.
So We are all here?
Who&#39;s in shock right now?
Who hurt these two?? I want names!!! This is tragic.
Here after he surprised the whole internet 🙌🏻
I wonder if the girl lost weight like he did too
I thought he was on a weight loss journey.......just sad
Two steps ahead…
I feel like the haters care more about his health than his followers
This chanel should be ilegal
i only watch him to see if he loses weight
it&#39;s actually amazing how she&#39;s still alive
I am disappointed I thought he was genuinely losing weight and trying to turn his life around😔
I came here from the 2 steps ahead video
i thought he lost a bunch of weight?
I really hope she&#39;s two steps ahead too 💀
People nowadays don&#39;t even watch his video for mukbangs but just to see if he&#39;s alive
"This is so sad... the worst part is, you can see how pretty she would be if you stripped away all the fat..."
Listen to the noises she makes just from mixing the ramen! She’s having trouble breathing. Smh
"Honestly, props to this guy for at least being realistic. All these tiny youtubers sit down with these mass amounts of food and never gain weight. This is the reality of it. If this is how you&#39;re eating, your body will show it."
I need to know the brand of that couch… some good quality-got more strength then a bridge.
“lifes short” <br>so you make it fucking shorter?
2 steps ahead
ALWAYS TWO steps ahead
How gross is this kind of content.
POV: u come from the new video to see how he was before
Good lord she&#39;s out of breath mixing noodles.
Those coming straight from the weight loss video 👇
Everyone is commenting so recently even tho this was posted a yr ago 😭💀
Glad to know we’re all here right now
"Nic, I hate to see you doing this to yourself… Please stop with the mukbangs and get some professional help before it is too late. We will support you. ❤"
2 steps ahead <br>Im always 2 steps ahead
"When the Avocado is the skinniest person in the room, you have a <b>serious</b> problem"
Who else comes to check his channel once in a while to see if he’s changed but is disappointed he didnt
I thought he lose weight💀
Fresh ahh comments
"We are all rewatching this, huh?"
"two steps ahead, two years ahead…"
Two step ahead
Why is everyone rotating from the other video 🤣
WHY IS EVERYONE HERE
Any one else come from that TikTok😂
Is the woman two steps behind
Nice to see he&#39;s taking time between videos for his own health. Genuinely good for him
Brooo I thought he was losing weight how sad
"he still keeps eating , i thought he quit and start diet 🥲 i got scammed"
Though he was loosing weight
"I hope your transformation can encourage the women sitting next to you, who is currently knocking on deaths door 🙏"
I thought he was losing weight
Bro is two steps ahead…..
"Don’t worry y’all, it’s just water weight. We don’t understand nutrition like he does"
The fact shes out of breath FROM MIXING THE NOODLES is hilarious
Two steps ahead...
BIGGEST plot twist irl
Two steps ahead
"Nikocado, ignore all the hate and fatphobic comments, you are bigger than all of this."
that couch is on life support
How many fresh comments
She cant even stir the noodles without heavy breathing…. I rather be starved than be a trainwrack like this
I now understand why gluttony is one of the 7 deadly sins.
did the girl lose the weight too or nah
bro is 2 steps ahead🗿
this being a “social experiment” is crazy.
So all of this was a social experiment bro
Being out of breath from mixing noodles is wild
How the hell!! are you out of breath from stirring noodles????
You’ve gotta stop this man there’s still a chance to turn this stuff around we’re here for you 😊
"Oh my gosh, she can hardly stand up and walk. This whole thing is so sad."
Wait- how is she out of breath by picking up some ramen noodles? 😭
She looks like she cant even walk
This man is 2 steps ahead shes 6 years behind
America….
"I want to thank you Nik, I really do. I’m 27, and have spent the last two years of my life suffering from health anxiety. Mainly worrying about my heart. Doctor’s said I was nowhere near unhealthy enough to be worried about my heart. It wasn’t until I came across your channel that I have really started to genuinely believe it. Seeing the lengths that you have been pushing your body to its limit for the last 5 years, I have been able to overcome my heart anxiety. In short, I’ve stopped worrying, because you are what someone close to a heart attack actually looks like."
Waiting for hers now!
Bro ain’t no way he lost all that weight in 7 months with no extra skin.
What an embarrassment to society
Nick. Please. Stop.
“It was all just a bad dream”
the crazy 2 steps ahead vid
SKINNY NIKOCADO AVACADO BEFORE GTA 6
bro really identified as skinny

This is honestly just sad. At this point I watch him to make me feel better about myself 😂😂
"I went from 340 to 178 (currently 181 and trying to gain a little weight cause I&#39;m almost underweight =.=) and seeing this yt&#39;er was definitely one of my motivators. There&#39;s nothing positive about gluttony, and I truly appreciate you showing me that, and occasionally being my motivation when I&#39;m having an emotional eating response to something. You can get healthy, but I don&#39;t believe that you really WANT to be healthy. Sitting next to an enabler who has no control herself is like throwing a match on an already burning fire. I hope you find your self worth some day."
The greatest social experience ever who ever new
Me watching all these new comments appear after a whole year 😂
Imagine not having a life and letting yourself go that badly.
If this really was all a social experiment.  It seems cruel inviting people with food addiction to eat with you if youve never had an issue loosing the weight
These are the only two muckbangers  in the entire world that don’t make me hungry
Two steps ahead.
this is sad as shit

Always two steps ahead…
Wait the progress was getting fatter? Did I jumped to another reality?!
let me ask you guys. Is SHE two steps away or no step to go away?
I check on this channel to see if he is still living. That is not a healthy way to live man thats hard on the heart and lungs when you are overweight aka obese it can potentially cause cardiovascular problems and feel like you lungs are being sat on by a elephant due to all the excess weight that is causing breathing problems
"I know 10 fat ppl in my life , they’re 9 of them"

"This isn&#39;t life, bro, I&#39;m glad he&#39;s okay, but she&#39;s going to die soon, her heart can&#39;t work with all that body mass, it must already be completely hypertrophied"
Bro was always two steps ahead.…
bro how do they eat this much at once like in a day I eat an apple water a Celsius and dinner
Where did the bird go? It’s probably in one of his muck bangs. As the food though.
"That woman’s belly is hanging on her knees, soon to be around the ankles"
Is that girl still alive?
Jesus this channel is sad. Can&#39;t believe YT allows this
Nah lady getting a work lifting the ramen 😂
"With this video you can educate you kids, do that and you will end like them!"
"Nick lost weight, that thing died"
no cuz why are these comments to recent
When he started YouTube he was so skinny
I&#39;ve always come to this channel to see him but I&#39;ve never expect this
The couch is holding on for dear life
"Reject modernity, embrace tradition. Gluttony will only lead to a life of sadness and death. I will pray for the both of you."
"Two steps a head , more like two years a head 😂🤯 super villain shit 💪🏻💪🏻"
no offense but how are they not dead this is unhealthy
I&#39;m surprised that he still ok
it would be so funny to se them near to each other NOW
He reminds me of that one guy on instagram that gained a lot of weight on purpose to prove how easy it is it lose it especially with discipline. If you actually listen to nick even when he was big like in his apartment he gave lots of advice on nutrition. I would really like to hear nick talk about his journey. Also the way y’all switched up on him just because he lost weight is sad. Proud of you nick! ❤
Imagine being out of breath from mixing your ramen noodles
2 steps ahead lil bro or big bro
This is vile...Yall need some help .. intervention... something <br>Unhealthy

Did I just spend 10 mins watching them stirring noodles to exhaustion like it’s the toughest thing they’ve done…
Nikko is two steps ahead🗿
"Her grunting and breathing when she is alone mixing those noodles pisses me off, and idk why."
He is always.. Two steps ahead.
STOP ITS LIKE 2AM STOP MAKEING ME HUNGERY👹👹👹
Im honestly surprised that they are drinking water and eating cucumber
"Bro, looks like Constance from monster House 💀💀💀💀💀"
YouTube is disgusting for monetizing and popularising content like this.
What   the  f..............................😮😮😮😮😮😮😢😢😢😢😂😂😂
That truly is so sad..They looked so healthy and happy before. Addiction to food can be worse than addiction to drugs..
"From <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ocpS7flaI&amp;t=1116"">18:36</a> listen with your eyes closed it sounds so wrong 😭"

Needle avocado I know you want to so if you get too fat you die so I don’t think you should do that you should work out sometimes and I know I’m a kid but I’m just giving you some advice so what time my friend got super big and they she died. Yeah so you have to work out it’s good for you and God doesn’t want your decoration to die but like you die some point but you’re young still you’re still young you don’t deserve it I know you just wanna keep eating and eating since it’s so delicious I haven’t ate spicy noodles I really want to but I can’t. My parents will probably say no so I can’t but I do eat regular noodles but also I’m skinny and I eat a lot but not like a lot a lot not like a lot a lot.

You should lose custody of your child.
I hope your kid never hears about the drama
Now he’s being called out for liking CP drawings. Disgusting.
Kris i hear you like them young<br><br>Edit: thanks for the likes 🤑
Thank fuck he lost his son.
PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM KIDS AND MY LITTLE BROTHER PLEASEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Trans women aren&#39;t women
Meanwhile him liking loli posts<br>Edit:yep you&#39;re cooked especially with those new allegations about talking with a kid when you were on college

"Ok seriously, who are the people subscribing to this channel?"
Your son is most definitely going to be bullied when he gets into school due to recent events
Dear Tucker...<br>I&#39;m sorry that that man is your father let me be honest.
"You are cooked bro. Stay away from MrBeast too, you will make things worse for him."
"SAY CHRIS, I HEAR YOU LIKE EM YOUNG"
You had a wife and kid but you threw that away for this shit?

"KRIS KRIS, GO AWAY, COME AND RIZZ KIDS ANOTHER DAY"
Pdf stay away go touch me another day
you literally fantasize about kids
You shouldn’t be allowed anywhere near children. You should be in jail
Finally people started to care. Kris: You are out. Jimmy&#39;s next.
feel bad for your son. he deserves a better father figure
"Certified Lover boy, Certified pdf file"
The child deserves a father that actually loves him loved by millions hated by billions now.
Abandoning his kid and wife? aw hell naw..I bet no one would date him if he ever want ones. What a such disgusting behavior to abandoned his whole family..
Tuckers soon to be villain arc when he grows up to call you out
this is genuinly sad😭😭
"the thing that makes me sad is that everyday i used to come home from a horrible day at school just to turn on mr beast and watch kris. i fucking hate how everything had to change. kris, you used to be my hero, now i look at you with disgust."
You did worlds biggest mistake🥺🥺
"say, kris, i heard you’re about to be locked up."
tryna strike a chord and its prolly a MINORRRRR
"Chris, you break my heart, you was great friend of Community and MrBeast! But now...its just memories, we didnt forgot this. We didnt."
Stop playing pretend

Of course he likes kids
It’s disgusting that u left your wife and child and abandoned your responsibilities as a husband and father to live in your little fairytale
Back off I&#39;m 15
"Honestly , I feel extremely bad for your son . Imagine finding out that your father likes cp drawing and plays dress up."
We owe an apology to SunnyV2...
What an actual weirdo.
"Say Chris, I hear you like ‘em young"
Kris u made the right decision to be away from your family. Never get close to kidssss
"Your kid deserves a father (dont go back tho, someone else pls)"
God made you who you are why would you change that
I think old chris would mock his modern self
We miss the old Chris!

"Say Kris, i hear you like em young, yet you can even take care of yo own f&#39;ing son. These bars get more fire as the drama gets higher, never as high tho as yo good karma back when you wass was straight."
"All I&#39;ll say is, as someone who knew Chris since he was 14. He really enjoyed futa. I&#39;m sure this is where his influence began."
"i think people should be aloud to do what they want to do with there life, but leaving your wife and son is disgraceful"
"&quot;Say kris,i hear you like em&#39; young,&quot;"

you are ruining your life and your sons

My complaint to kris <br><br><b>stop touching kids</b>

Pssst i see dead people
"So, we have a dude that can&#39;t assume that he is gay, so he goes trans, but wait there&#39;s more, he is also a kid lover lol"
Bro paused his latest comments on the last two videos “ certified lover boy certified pdf “
She became edp
drake collab when
"I love kids, Jimmy! I LOVE KIDS!!!"
&quot;Left your kid to play with dolls&quot;💀💀
RIP old Chris. Dude was a Chad. MACK is our only hope now
He’s so lost
"This is what happens to someone who does that trust fall thing, but the person doesn’t catch you."
Bro fell off💀
What the fuck is this old Chris would be embarrassed
Hey remeber when you were sharing and promoting Shadmans art?
Bro hopefully we all see a man come out of a metal ward one day. Rip Chris

"I feel so bad for tucker, he doesn&#39;t deserve any of this"
"Your wife may respect your choices, but just remember your son"
question. what does kris and biden have in common? 😂😂😂😂
Kris left his wife and son so he can indirect himself from the path of god. Wow
I feel bad for his son:(
Get away from your child!
Why is so hard for you to not like kids like they’re so annoying
Bro left his wife and kids to do this 😭
&quot;Everyone around me knows im trans&quot; no shit

"I don’t give a crap about someone being who they are, what makes me mad is people not realizing that anyone (almost) can be themselves."
Bro had everything
This comment section is the perfect example of ignorance and hate for the wrong reasons and why someone like Mrbeast will always succeed and continue succeeding
"jus stay away from kids, throw away your computer, you&#39;re sick you need help !"

This is honestly so sad. Downfall of America right here
Mustard on that beat yo

Channel deleted in 3……2……
you like em kiddos huh
Chris please don&#39;t. I can&#39;t bear the pain by looking at Mack in your place. All of this is not worth it. If you are facing any issues talk to someone.
Time to be a statistic
I’ve never seen a bigger glowdown than what happened to Chris. I don’t think you get why many people are mad about your transition. You use to be the fun loving southern athletic goofball of the group that many fans grew up with. And now you left your family and your whole personality. And now your this whole different person who just makes gay jokes .I never got why you married someone and had a kid when this whole time you wanted to transition.
What a great father
time traveller: moves a chair<br>chris:
Bro is dr. Disrespect but actually disrespect the law
BRO WHO IS THAT THAT AINT CHRIS BRO💀

whenever jimmy talks listen.<br>whever chandler talks laugh.<br>whenever &#39;&#39;kris ava chiris or whatever the fuck&quot; talks hide your kids.
I used to watch Mr.Beast because of prime Chris. This shit makes me wanna throw up!
I was worried about your kid growing up without her dad. <br>Now I’m worried about your kid having a “daddy”
R.I.P CHRIS TYSON😢
"guys stop making fun of HIM in the comments, i have to like every one of them"
"You just left your wife, your kids, your friends, your fame and your money, just to be a pdf"
im haapy in INDIA  it doesnt have this bs
Whats up with Shadman?
Bro got exposed 😂
"You&#39;re no different than my father who ran away, the only difference is that you put on a wig and got off easily."
"Flat, would def not tap"
This is hard to look at.
you just sound like any other guy
What you will say if your father did this <br>How ashame he will go to school
You abandoned your wife and kids Chris. Let that sink in.
holy shit💀

Hes confused he had a kid and then left his family to play dress up
He sounds stupid
"Dude you left you family for this, pathetic"
Your ex wife should be allowed full custody of that kid.
"Why are you guys forcing your personal feelings on their children? Her wife supports her, and children are children who do not understand the complexities of the human mind. Y’all are all grown-ups, so should understand each other&#39;s feelings.<br><br>And it seems like they have no problems with each other. It&#39;s just you guys who are causing more problems for her family and friends.😅"
MINOOOOOOOR
"well well well, look how the cat came back"
"Ava, I hear you like em young."
I hope your son is unaware of this and he&#39;s safe with his mom and I hope his mother tells you to get out of their face everytime you try and visit them.
The dad lore is not gonna be a good one when tucker hears about this in like 6 years

Doing the voice isn’t the only thing that’s hard
Great dad.
"If you were doing something inappropriate to children/minors, you should not be allowed near your child.  If you weren&#39;t doing those things, then you need to try really hard and prove that you didn&#39;t.

People need to mind their own business when it comes to other peoples choices about who they are and want to be… there should be no place for hate and transphobia
ew
"You’re almost as bad as Moistcritical, almost.<br><br>He is much worse because he just hasn’t been caught yet and has a cult following so his allegations get swept under the rug.<br><br>Mark my words, Moistcritical is the worst of them all."

Yo stop being so mean. Yes I know what Ava did. But you have done things to not just Ava. Be mad at me but I don’t care!😡😡
bruh your fine with what you want to do with your body but some people want the old chris  witch is there choice do what you wanna do though😊
Shut uphaters! kirs it&#39;s OK people will hate on you but that don&#39;t matter if you want to be a woman do it think about this you are being hated just for being trans but people can&#39;t change you.

I support you Kris Tyson
im almost 100% sure this ad is trying its hardest to be as cringe as possible so ppl would share it around calling it cringe. this is just TOO on the nose
"If my bus driver ever says “mAxImUm AuRa PoInTs” to me, no one is getting off that bus alive."
This commercial activates my fight or flight response
&quot;What&#39;s Ohio?&quot;<br>Bro&#39;s never been taught US states 💀💀💀
"Remember fellas, These people literally had to hire a whole camera crew, budget and purchase the props, and also get actors and a director for this."
"There should be an extra one cause of <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=6"">0:06</a>. She says chat"
Walmart needs to declare bankruptcy
“Maximum aura points” yea we’re cooked
we got brainrot on commercials now 💀😭😭
The most unrealistic part of this was the bus driver being nice to the kids
We never getting flying cars with this stuff
"Because of this ad, I’m shoplifting every time I go to Walmart."
This makes YouTube Rewind 2018 look like cinema.
Bro when I was their age I thought eating a four leafed clover would give me superpowers 😭🙏💀
Saw this commercial. Now I shop at target.
At least they didn&#39;t say &quot;SIGMA SKIBIDI TOILET KAI CENAT FANUM TAX GYATT RIZZ&quot; because if they did we&#39;re cooked.
I find it impossible that marketing executives have met actual human beings
"I do like the concept of a bus driver getting advice from a student, like it seems pretty simple and pretty wholesome, but my god…"
i lost braincells
“Sigma or Ohio?”<br>“Sigma”<br><br>GOT ME HARD 😭
this one commercial set society back no less than 25 years
"I better see a corporate apology video, ukulele and everything"
This is literally the grubhub ad and chips ahoy situation again
What an unfortunate day to have literary and auditory skills.
"As a Gen Z’er who hears all this, I can say we both absolutely do not speak like that, and on certain occasions we’re even worse, mostly sarcastically <br><br>Edit: yes I know this is Gen Alpha but don’t you get it wrong, we say some of these words too. Especially Rizz, Sigma, and Aura"
Why do adults think we say these words literally every second? We literally use them as jokes
She honestly Skibidi with that acting
She looks like jojo siwa from wish 😭😭
“Hip with the kids” ahh video 😭🙏
And Walmart goes bankrupt🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯
What bus driver is that attractive?
My brain still can’t comprehend this is a real ad
Can&#39;t wait for the next commercials<br>&quot;I gyatt to rizz up that alpha!&quot;<br>&quot;Skibidi sigma ohio!&quot;
"&quot;what&#39;s up, fellow kids?&quot; Except we&#39;re just combining the slang of Gen Z and Gen Alpha"
I saw this shit in a fucking movie theater 😭😭😭<br><br><br><br><br><br>Edit: omg mom I&#39;m not famous
"I am fine with regular brainrot because mlg was a thing, but this commercial is like if Nickelodeon tried to make an mlg compilation"
&quot;Greetings fellow children&quot;
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=3"">0:03</a> Bro thanks she&#39;s the next jojo seaweed ☠️"
What’s so much worse is all the adults who probably laughed at this commercial
"The most unrealistic part of the ad is honestly the fact that someone that attractive and fashionable is a school bus driver. What bus driver would put that much effort into their appearance when the associated stress of the job puts you 10 years closer to the grave? If she was a teacher, I&#39;d get it, but a bus driver seriously? Also, no bus driver would ever step off the bus to walk a kid towards the school"
"Wrong, the cringe counter is 10"
<b>Reminder that this goes on for FIVE. MINUTES. in the full ad.</b>
Who woke up one morning and thought to direct this. Who sat down an entire council of people discussing how good of an idea this is. AND WHO APPROVED
Me before watching this: I’m having a good day with no intentions of self harm<br><br>Me after watching this: I want to play Russian roulette with myself and all 6 bullets
When ironic humor is taken as unironic vocabulary ☠️
"The fact that the kid looked DIRECTLY at the camera at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=39"">0:39</a> is killing me 😭😭"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=11"">0:11</a>  I couldn&#39;t fully comprehend what word was said."
She doesn’t even finish “You ate” she just says “You æ”
I feel like I’ve entered Hell now.
This is why aliens won’t visit us
The pistol looking mighty fine right know
Y&#39;all this ain&#39;t the whole ad 💀<br>The ad&#39;s 4 minutes 💀
"“Guys we need something to relate to the kids so teens will spend their money in our store!” <br>“Just spam random slang words you find on the internet into the script, that should work.”"
I haven’t seen this one on tv yet and I hope I never have to endure it again!
the people who made this commercial are the same people would pronounce meme as &quot;meh-meh&quot;
Saying &quot;the 1900&#39;s&quot; like it&#39;s before electricity existed made my bones hurt.
I saw one of these ads. Mfing 40 year old woman said rizzy rizz 😭😭
How movies thought the 21st century would be: Flying cars and super advanced technology!<br>The 21st century IRL: B R A I N R O T
You know if a A.I apocalypse happens. Im joining A.I
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=32"">0:32</a> the only thing that could’ve made this worse is if she said “ay dap me up”"
9 billion neurons are rotting inside my brain as of watching this
"why is this a walmart ad?? nothing to do with whats in the friggin shop, just &quot;omg no cap your fit slays&quot;??? atleast that one ad with the black guy and the balloon had SOMETHING to do with the product (the end)"
as an australian that dosent have a single walmart commercial i am glad that i didnt have to watch this until now
Ain’t no way full-grown woman said “what’s Ohio.” She said it like she hasn’t even heard of the state.
"Dear Walmart:<br><br>Unmake this. <br><br>Sincerely, everyone"
"This isn’t even brain rot, this is just new slang terms from a new generation."
these superpowers gettin nutrealized i can only watch in silence..
I love the corporatocracy!!!  I love the lizard people who make all my commercials!!!  Yes please give me more!!!  YEss!!! YEAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAA
Influencer moms must be lapping this up.
"This is like that part in that inside out short where Riley’s mom tries to talk to her about her boyfriend but with, “cool” slang."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=32"">0:32</a>  that shit sent shockwaves through my brain (I’m a headphone user on weed)"
This is a Grant Wisler video that became a reality
the “aura points” got me gang I’m so done none of us talk like this 😭
"saw deadpool &amp; wolverine in theaters, the commercial for amazon prime said &quot;get the most rizzy rizzy clothes for back to school for your little freeloaders&quot;"
Got jumpscared by the euphoria instrumental at the end
its not as bad as that one amazon ad that felt straight out of family guy
fire the marketing team
This made me steel from my local Walmart🤑🤑🤑
This is the exact reason why I am considering to get YouTube premium.
"I hate back to school ads with a passion, but this one... Spirits begone from this house"
They are trying so hard to fit in with kids😭😭
I swear the marketing team did this on purpose so people would share it and talk about it. Genius if you ask me
"If I suddenly saw this commercial while I was drunk, I would cry laughing from how terminally stupid it is"
"I had to watch this ad before a GOOD movie. Lord have mercy on all of our brains. Also, THE EXTENDED VERSION. IT WAS LIKE 5 MINUTES LONG!!! The worst, most horrible, most cringey line was in chalk on the ground: “All Rizz no cap”. I have lost faith in humanity."
I have never seen a bus driver so happy wtf what&#39;s going on 💀
Walmart really pulling the HOW DO YOU DO FELLOW KIDZ vibe with this one.
i feel like this took 10 years of my lifespan
The 1900s line definitely deserved a mark on the counter too
We got a brainrot Walmart commercial before GTA 6💀
"It&#39;s 9 points because she said &quot;no cap&quot;, &quot;cringe&quot;, and &quot;Ohio&quot; and the adult questioned what &quot;Ohio&quot; was."
We ain’t gonna shop at Walmart ever again with this one 🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
School bus: +1<br>People happy in the bus: +1<br>Teenage music in bus: +1<br>Bell: +1
I think a wimpy 6 on the cringe counter is FAR FAR too generous. I&#39;m gonna need to sleep this one off as if I have the flu
lol a corporation roasting an entire state too 🤣🤣😭
“How do you do fellow kids?”
Maybe we were a little too harsh towards Youtube Rewind 2018...
Oscar worthy acting
This commercial turn my suicidal thoughts into plans.
LMAO both gen alpha and gen z say things like “sigma skibidi rizz” completely ironically but theyve completely fooled millennials+older
"The school bus in the video is a 1990 IC 3000, it lived to see the days when the saying &quot;nerd&quot; and &quot;dork&quot; and &quot;give me your lunch money&quot; was more popular than &quot;cringe&quot; and &quot;ohio&quot; and &quot;skibidi toilet rizzler fanumtax in ohio&quot;"
THEM SUPERPOWERS GETTING NEUTRALIZED I CAN ONLY WATCH IN SILENCE🔥🔥🔥
The bus driver is an influencer… of course she’s in it.
that poor Blue Bird 37000 bus having to be the main location where this all has to happen 😭
"Remember, it’s not the child’s fault if they get dumber, it’s the parents’."
Thank god Target doesn’t go for shit like this 😅😅😅😅
The fire alarm sound was justified
bro walmart was desperate
"Your counter has 6? Mine has 100, what the skibidi"
next one they&#39;re gonna be like &quot;get the new skibidi slicers at walmart&quot;
Bro this ad played in class and me and my friends we were laughing and wheezing on the floor this video made my day🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is exactly how middle school girls act 😭
Best target ad I’ve ever seen
Did I just have a stroke
"Me after watching this ad:<br>“Hey Joker, do you need help making a pencil disappear?”"
I hate how this generation is going to replace us
I can&#39;t tell if this is better or worse than the grubhub ads
They forgot the skibidi sigma rizz
“Whats Ohio? 😃”
I actually couldn’t believe that this was real when I first saw it. No way this isn’t an SNL parody in disguise.
I say these things so much I don&#39;t even know if its un-ironic anymore 💀
"Walmart -100,000 aura??? 😭 I&#39;ve genuinely never heard anyone use &quot;Aura&quot; irl"
i got lock jaw watching this
WALMART NEEDS TO CLOSE DOWN.
I must cleanse my mind with “brother may I have some oats”
I love the “oh” when the driver resides that she said “1900s”
Flying cars they said.
"“How do you do, fellow children!”<br>Ahh ad 😭"
"If I ever go to the US, I will make sure to never buy anything in a Walmart in my life."
“This is what the kids find cool nowadays” <br>                                -the people at Walmart
"If this was directed like a self-aware, tongue in cheek satire it would have actually been a killer ad. I have a 12 year old daughter and this ad nails the zoomer brain rot she picks up at school perfectly."
&quot;What&#39;s Ohio&quot; she clearly failed Geography class
"content of the video aside, there is no bus driver that looks or dresses like that on the job"
This was too generous
"I bet the conversation was for this ad was<br>“People! We need a ad that the Kids will be trendy with! Something Trendy! Something the kids will like”<br>“I’ve got one!”<br>“Good! The kids will surely like this!”<br><br>But seriously who’s idea was it to include slang words that kids don’t use seriously, it’s like they hired a so called “Slangologist” so they could get the children to like the ad"
Nah that first girls outfit did not eat 😭💀
My honest reaction<br><br><br><br><br><br>KILLME KILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKIOOMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLMEKILLEMEKILLMEAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAYA
"Even as a 2000s kid, “1900s” feels wrong"
Tesco: Every Little Helps!<br><br>Walmart: Maximum Aura points.
“What’s Ohio”<br>Me: A state from U.S.A
I can just imagine the co-workers going:<br>“Well how do we get more popular?”<br>“..Hmm.. what do the kids like?”<br>“ <b>✨B R A I N R O T✨</b> ”
Is this is an ACTUAL commercial?
I was expecting the Ohio one to make the counter shoot up to 10^14.
Welcome back 2020-2021
Walmart single-handedly killing slang and getting everyone to speak like Sephiroth.
Euphoria at the end 😅😅
"As a kid in the 90&#39;s, i was thinking we would have like selftie shoes from back to the future..."
Them superpowers bein neutralized i can only watch in scilence
Let’s be honest. Smartest marketing move ever. They knew how much internet attention this was gonna get
"Imagine having a stage parent who forced you to audition for this attocity, and you dont get the part. There&#39;s not enough therapy in the world"
Why did euphoria start playing😭😭😭😭
"“Kaylen, that fit slays”<br>Will be stuck in my head now😭💀"
This hurts
"Literally the least realistic school bus driver ever, lol. Thin, relatively young, conventionally attractive, dressed up, not tired—whoever was in charge of this was clearly a career carpool kid."
We got Brainrot Walmart ads before GTA 6.
"As an 11 year old gen alpha, Walmart needs to be stopped."
"Only 6 on the counter? You must be feeling generous, I counted more than a dozen"
My frontal lobe is struggling to work after watching this ad
I’m gen alpha and this makes me wanna go shrivel up in a corner and cry
i was forced to watch a 5 minute version of this advertisement at the movies. man has built hell on earth
Someone one get a damn award for the actors that did this crap 💀🙏
"Ad agency: &quot;our ad is about a school bus driver&quot;<br>Casting, make-up &amp; costume: &quot;ok, here&#39;s a rich soccer mum&quot;"
them superpowers getting neutralized I can only watch in silence
“ Everyone’s really feeling themselves “ weird but she’s saying everyone’s in a good mood
"Have we not learned from the Chips Ahoy ads? It&#39;s a genius marketing strategy to make an ad so stupid, people can&#39;t help but share it online"
I&#39;m suddenly tempted to shoplift things I don&#39;t need.
"As an older member of the Gen Z community, I would sincerely like to apologize on behalf of what the younger half of the group is saying/doing."
"We have nikocado loosing weight, mr beast getting canceled, and brainrot walmart ads. What a time to be alive"
When she says ‘that will be our lesson on the ride home’ she looks directly at the camera for like half a second 😂
"As an entree level Walmart worker, I&#39;d just like to apologize on behalf of the entire company for this."
&quot;maximum aura points&quot; more like i lost aura just watching this 😭😭
"Hippity hoppity, walmart no longer has me there Shoppity"
&quot;HOW DO YOU DO FELLOW KIDS&quot;
George Washington did not fight  for this shit to be made 💀💀
I’m scared that when my internet gets better all of sudden I’ll hear “BE A SIGMA AND SHOP AT WALMART”
I’m still in disbelief that this wasn’t a skit.
Ain&#39;t no way we got brainrot commercials before GTA 6
Walmart needs to get their shit together cause no one talks like that 😭😭
The fact they&#39;ve played this before the last 3 movies I saw (the full 5 min version too)
This is definitely a bit tongue in cheek.
I thought I was watching an ad I didn&#39;t know this was an actual video😭
I think my Brain has stopped Working after Watching this
"Chat, idk what you’re talking about.<br>This really makes me want to shop at Walmart!<br>I usually just shoplift but now I’ll consider paying!"
"It&#39;s giving &quot;how do you do, fellow kids?&quot;"
The most cringe part is it&#39;s 8 year olds talking like this and no 8 year olds talk like that.
Them superpowers gettin neutralized
This should be classified as a war crime.
if bro played the whole ad the cringe counter would break 💀
Every godamn damn second of that ad deserved to bring the counter up
I expected them to say &quot;skibidi&quot; or &quot;erm what the sigma&quot; 😭🙏
Rule number 1: <b>NEVER</b> use slang in commercials.
Imagine engaging with children as superiors.<br><br>Imagine being a corporation.
bro why did euphoria start playin at the end end no way they got my goat in brainrot 😭😭
"Brought to you by the Kamala Harris campaign heads. This is what you guys want, right? <br><br>Vote blue!!"
"Walmart is making it worse for themselves. First, they make one of the worst stores ever to exist (because I&#39;m forced to go there with my mom every other day, and now they&#39;re making garbage ads??? I&#39;m not very surprised, to say the least."
In my minds eye I can see the boardroom busy coming up with this idea for a commercial
If she was a real bus driver she&#39;d warning that girl to not make her tap the sign again
"ok, this is def going for the &quot;all publicity is good publicity&quot; approach, they were trying to get people sharing it while saying it&#39;s cringe. a commercial is supposed to say something to make one interested in whatever is being sold, but there&#39;s legit nothing in it that would make any sane person go to Walmart, there&#39;s just no substance. it&#39;s like saying you want to drink water while pointing at a frying pan<br><br>so all in all, I&#39;d say they succeeded, joke&#39;s on us"
It&#39;s cringe that the bus driver looks that good and put together and happy about her job.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=29"">0:29</a><br>&quot;everyone really is killing themselves&quot; honestly, THIS was the last reason."
This is the reason why the world stock market is gonna crash
"I honestly thought this was AI when I watched it. I didn’t think Walmart could make such a horrible commercial, but I have sadly been proven wrong."
"I hope Walmart knows that after seeing this ad, I&#39;ll be far too embarrassed to even step foot in their sores now."
They were probably pointed at gunpoint to say all this stuff in the commercial.<br><br>This just makes my brain hurt dude (even as Gen Z)
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=29"">0:29</a> &quot;everyone&#39;s really killing themselves&quot; me after I saw this ad"
I can feel my brain cells making toast in the bathtub <br>                         - Steven He
we got commercials trying to be hip with the kids irl before gta 6 💀
That kid with the bow hair be looking like JoJo Siwa 2.0
"To begin with, that woman is too hot and bubbly to be a school bus driver."
I wish my bus driver looked like that! 😂
Whoever allows their child to wear bows like that on their head need to be reported to CPS
i have been rewatching this video so much i can recite every line<br>like how it was in the 19 hundreds 💅
We went from the mean girls commercial to this? 🤦🏾‍♀️
If this video was any longer I would’ve painted my wall with my brains💀💀💀
Sam Walton didn&#39;t die for this.
i got a walmart ad when i clicked on this
this ad makes the chips ahoy ads look great
&quot;How Do You Do Fellow Kids?&quot; <br>- Steve Buscemi
When I&#39;m in an overexaggeration challenge and my opponent is this comment section: 😨
They did a version that just went on for what felt like an eternity (I&#39;m pretty sure it was at least 5 minutes) and I felt like ripping my skin off when they played it at the theatre before the actual previews started. Never getting to a movie early again T-T
"It&#39;s giving, hello fellow kids vibes"
It&#39;s like they did this on purpose just to lose our braincells
"WHATS UP, MY FELLOW KIDDOS?<br>Ah vibe"
the back to school ads are wild fr
<b>WE GETTING OUR BRAINS EATEN WITH THIS ONE</b> 🗣🗣🗣🗣🔥🔥🔥🔥
Those super powers getting neutralize
And we all thought their 2019 Black Friday ad was cringe
Walmart trying to be “hip with the kids” 😭🙏
Dude I saw this ad in the theater. 😭😭😭
How did &quot;1900s&quot; not get a point? That drives tons of people born in the &#39;90s or earlier (myself included) nuts.
Euphoria at the end healed me
The only issue with this is that the counter is way too low
"Ever meet anyone who likes Wal-Mart? Yeah, me neither. Thank god for H-E-B."
the pain it hurts they don&#39;t even use brainrot properly
you forgot the &quot;we are so back&quot; on the board in the first shot
Nah they slayed the ironicism. Not cringe if you own it. They ate.
Wanted: flying cars<br>Got: Walmart being stupid
"We should like, actually make it illegal for any corporate executive, no matter the age, to try to use slang in commercials like this. I can already barely tolerate seeing &quot;Hits different&quot; and &quot;(x) is a vibe&quot; in bargain bins across the country, but like... Can we sanction a company like we do countries?"
I appreciate them not counting the &quot;back in the 1900s&quot; joke because that one isn&#39;t cringey so much as mean. And kids absolutely say that with total sincerity.
That bus driver has a gyatt
The most unrealistic part of this was the hot bus driver.
I swear bro i normally just stare at the actress the whole time but i couldn’t this time 😭🙏
&quot;maximum aura points&quot; GIRL YOUR A GROWN WOMAN
Seeing this make me want to go  to Walmart to buy a toaster and proceed  to drop it in a bathtub.
im gonna start shoplifting from walmart now
Watching this american commercial as a non-american is so weird to us
Walmart should provide 10 free trips to everyone for making this blight on humanity
And the sad part is that they probably spent a ton of money creating and advertising this
The maximum aura points made me shit my pants
This feels like it&#39;s catered to people who can&#39;t even get a job yet.
"This is just CRINGE misappropriation of AAVE and just misuse of gen z slang. Walmart, you’re paying for my therapy."
I feel like I got tear gassed
Bro euphoria starting at the end killed me for sum reason
That woman is NOT making minimum wage driving a bus so I don&#39;t need the cringe counter for this because it already broke.
This makes my skeleton itchy
"As a Gen Z who feels as thoigh was born in the wrong time, I say this is how it feels everyday hearing pwople in class or the hallways."
Sam Walton did not die for this 😭
"I feel like the military pulled up and started blasting M4s, MP5s, RPGs, at point blank range right next to my ear while a rooster crowed and  gangam style&#39;d to old mcdongal had a farm.<br><br>Moral of the story: don&#39;t put gen-z slang in your ad. Or it might sound like this."
I&#39;m sueing Walmart.
When we getting them hover boards with this stuff? Rip humanity
Them superpowers get neutralized
Walmart executives just sent Society back 19 years we aint never getting holographic technology at this rate 😭
Now I am glad that walmart failed to become profitable in my country (which is germany btw if you were wondering)
What a horrible day to be sentient
This is why Aliens won&#39;t visit us<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The Brainrot will kill them
"It’s funny how marketing not too long ago made us want to be cool, like the kids in the commercials, but now the new cool kids make us unsettled, like we would rather be ANYTHING ELSE other than what modern “cool” is supposed to be."
first time this ad popped up i shouted &quot;YOU INSIGNIFICANT FUCK!&quot;. when i realized this was real and not a dream
"Lyrics:<br>&quot;Taylen that fit slays&quot;<br>&quot;Cap, can i tell you a secret? We dont say slay, We say You ate&quot;<br>&quot;You ate, cool what else you got<br><b>Whispers</b> &quot;Maximum aura&quot;<br>&quot;Maximum aura points, Poppin the preppy vibes, Wait is preppy cool again?&quot; &quot;But its different, from how it was in the 1900s&quot; &quot;Oh oh, So everyone is really feeling themselves&quot; &quot;No cap, You aren&#39;t cringe or ohio&quot; &quot;Whats ohio&quot;<br>&quot;That will be are lesson on the way home&quot; <br>Tell me if I made any mistakes"
Can these big corporate companies just stop with trying to be cool with the kids just to make a quick book because it is absolutely cringe💀
This video have extracted IQ from my brain
Grant wisler predicted this and we just laughed 😔
Jokes aside the girl&#39;s acting is pretty good.
When ads try to be &quot;hip with the kids&quot;
I saw this commercial on TikTok and was like wtf
Someone in there mid 30s who’s trying to fit in with the new gen made this script
6? That’s a very low number for the amount of times I wanted to break my phone while watching this
Even Gail Lewis would be disappointed
I feel like I lost all of my aura. And my sanity.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=34"">0:34</a> this hurt my ears so funkin&#39; bad"
"I’m gen Alpha and I never Heard anyone my ate or younger saying ,,preppy” ,,maximum aura points”  or ,,No cap”."
Walmart is about to get that lucrative 12-and-under demographic.
&quot;Everyone&#39;s really killing themselves!&quot; - Walmart 2024
Were not going to walmart with this one🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️🗣️
The only good thing about this ad is that they didn&#39;t use a &quot;skibidi&quot;
"Everyone is talking about how cringe this is, but ive seen a lot of kids speak exactly like this thinking it wasnt cringe"
The Ad was so bad that the dialog wasn’t even recorded on-set. It looked like those actors were lip-syncing. I wouldn&#39;t want any of thst nonsense coming out of my mouth on camera either
"the fact that my parents like Walmart when I was little, and I think they still do- 😭😭😭"
I have officially lost my faith in humanity.
Not the euphoria intro at the end 😭
"despite our differences, all the generations can come together and agree that this sucks"
THEM SUPERPOWERS GETTING NEUTRALIZED
This makes not want to go to Walmart anymore
They didn’t say “I’m the alpha sigma skibidi ohio.” 😢
This makes me want to steal from a Walmart
At least there was no:<br>Skibidi<br>Sigma<br>Rizz
Went to school in the 90s; ‘preppy’ has never been cool
How did I see this shit in a movie theater💀
A state thats 221 years old and it took some scooter kids calling it goofy to destroy any legacy that Ohio has left
Walmart thinking they caught up with the year 2024
"If You Think This Is What, WYD If During A Walmart Commercial They Say: “Skibidi Gyatt Rizzler”"
Them super powers been neutralized
Bro we got brainrot on live television before Gta 6 thats crazy 💀
Am I the only one who thinks this is hilarious??😂
"You were too lenient, I counted like 20"
no cringe counter for when she called the ‘90s the “1900s”?
"That is not a bus driver, I have never seen a bus driver under 57."
Thank god my country’s ads are peak
Its pretty bad that the animated Kroger commercials aren&#39;t as bad as this.
I&#39;m telling a trusted adult how this commercial makes me uncomfy 😭🙏
Yeah no wonder people always steal from Walmart
&quot;STOP! FUCKING STOP--&quot; -DigitalInfinity
"Character AI ah conversation 💀💀💀 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=7"">0:07</a>"
Thank God i was born in Lebanon
I like it when they said: “it’s ohio time”
This really explains a lot about the West nowadays
Euphoria playing at the end is wild.
"No, you missed the goofy bows and the teacher saying &quot;everyone&#39;s really feeling themselves&quot;<br>I counted 8."
This is gonna be my 13th reason
The ending is so brain rotted and funny 😂
"&quot;I&#39;ve lost all ambition<br>For worldly acclaim&quot;"
My local Walmart changed their name to skibidimart
My interest in learning english and it&#39;s consequences have been a disaster for my mental health
We got Walmart brainrot ads before Gta 6
i&#39;d rather wish that mac and cheese parody advert was real
At least they didn’t say “Gyatt” or “Rizz”
At least they didn’t say skibidi toilet or sigma
We got a brainrot walmart commercial before gta 6 💀😭
"my last 2 braincells are fried, thanks walmart. now im never robbing them again"
"There was more, watch the whole ad. The counter would exceed limits"
This doesn’t contain Sigma Meal: Skibidi Slicers. Cringe Counter: Infinite
We got brainrot Walmart before gta 6 💀
There is no bus driver that is this pretty lol
"Honestly, as a younger person who uses and hears people say all this stuff (or something close to it) multiple times a day, this add isn’t even bad. I don’t really see why everyone is so upset and crying over all the “brain rot”, because they didn’t even say skibbidi, gyat, rizz, or anything. It’s just stuff that kids say sometimes that’s been exaggerated for commercial advertising. In my opinion, it just comes off as a funny and cute story about the younger gen sharing their creativity to others"
"Ngl, that’s max aura points when she’s an alpha"
I don’t want to live on this planet anymore
when the kid grows up this will be her biggest shame
Ayo was that Euphoria at the end 💀
&quot;commercial tryong to be hip with the kids&quot;
This commercial makes me cry
"Let the TV &amp; State Schooling tell them who they are, then they’ll tell their parents."
This makes story of undertale look like the fucking mona lisa
Brain rot<br>Brain rot<br>Brain rot <br>Brain rot<br>Brain<br>ROT<br>BRAIN ROT
I missed the old commercials
“Wow everyone’s really killing themselves 💀” I thought they said killing 😭
I dont want to live on this planet anymore
wtf is you ate ive never heard a single other kid say that
"Literally clicked on this video and skipped 10 seconds ahead, Woops"
"When tf did Walmart made an ad? I mean, I know I don&#39;t live in a place with one but seriously?"
"Bruh I counter 4,275.628957139087 amount of cringe points, I think there’s a few more than. 6"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=23"">0:23</a> <br>“But it’s different from how it was in the 1900s” 💅💅💅💅🙄🙄🙄"
This reminds me of the stupid chips ahoy ads a few years ago 🤣
Please put me out of my misery
I fucking hated this commercial. It was brain dissolving. I was in tears to watch the 2024 twister movie in this freaking came on and I was gonna scream.
I fucking hated this commercial. It was brain dissolving. I was in tears to watch the 2024 twister movie in this freaking came on and I was gonna scream.
I’m surprised they didn’t use “sigma”
The Eurphoria intro 💀
"You are, in fact, wrong. <br>You missed a zero after the six"
When I try to watch the Beetlejuice movie this came up 😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏
"hey, let’s get this video to more views than Walmart! 😂"
You forgot to add the goofy dance scene at the end… the cringe counter would be at 100 if you added it omg-
I don’t even know if this is real or AI. That AI toys r us commercial changed my perception of commercials for life.
My brain shut down at “Ohio” 💀
"Actually, +1 in the beginning when we saw those annoyingly big bows on that little kid"
imagine a kid saw this ad on tv
Walmart has just given me a trauma
walmart really &quot;ate&quot; shit with this one
Bro I got stage 5 brain cancer while watching this.
Plot twist this is a ploy so the geb Z would stop using that language
The back to school ads are crazy
this commercial feels like a parody
This lady doesnt even know her states... SHAME!!!!!!!!!!!
The world needs more ads like the among us chips ahoy ones
"strangely, i sort of love this commercial.  it looks intentionally cringe and very meta, which is very unique compared to the plethora of unintentionally cringe commercials on tv."
"This ain’t real, you can’t convince me it’s real"
i can feel the radiation kicking in
This made bile rise up in my throat.
You know you&#39;re getting old when you&#39;re a gen z cringing at gen alpha&#39;s dumbass sayings.
THEY CANT KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
Bro they pulled a chips ahoy 💀
BRO THE SIGN SAYS WE ARE SO BACK MORE LIKE WE ARE NOT BACK WITH THIS ADVERTISEMENT
and i thought chips ahoy ads were bad
My bus driver was born and raised in the US and could not articulate english.
This ad is overwhelmingly caucasian
"&quot;how you doing, fellow kids?&quot;"
Teleportation machines they said
"As a gen alpha, I dont even know kids these days talk like that"
&quot;maximum aura points&quot; 💀💀
Adds are meant to make more people want to buy your product/s but after seeing this add I never want to go to Walmart ever again
Bro I really wish we could go bad to the 1900s
I think you missed quite a few
They gotta strop trying to be &quot;hip with the kids&quot; because it rots my brain more than the actual brainrot
Incorrect. The bus driver is 100% of the time older than 50 based on my experience
You forgot the girl mewing in that one shot in the classroom🥲🥲
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=35"">0:35</a> WTF WHYD YOU BUST MY EARDRUMS<br><br>and why does euphoria start playing at the end 💀"
I&#39;m pretty sure gen alpha isn&#39;t old enough to go to Walmart
Gen z when new generation 😡😡😡
Walmart cooked when nobody was hungry 🔥🔥💀💀🗿🗿🤡🤡
I got a Walmart ad before this lol
I bet they were held at gunpoint while making this 😭😭😭😭
Counter is 6. So that means 60% cringe.
Never going to school again 💀
I hate when companies try to use genz slang just to attract them when the only thing theyre attracted to are cheap rotteserie chicken
“feeling themselves” ???? 😭
And this is why Target is better
every 7 sec there&#39;s at least one brainrot word
"I hope this is why they&#39;re lowering their prices; otherwise, no one would show up after this."
This is very important im glad I spent my time watching this
"Why is there bus driver young and hot, and mine is old and mean 😭"
I was watching that in the movie theater and me and my sister were just side eying each other the whole ad
Do they have anybody under the age of 50 producing these commercials? 😂
"Yep, never buying things from Walmart ever again, this bs is probably a human rights violation"
WATCH THE FULL AD ITS THREE MINUTES AND HAS MUCH MORE BRAINROT
this ad gave me a pneumothorax ☠️
if you look closely it says &quot;bogle elementary&quot;
PLEASE HELP MY SANITY
You were being lenient.
First Dunkin’ Donuts now  Walmart ☠️🙏
I saw this in a movie theater and it was 4 MINUTES LONG
"It&#39;s only cringe because a corporation did it, but y&#39;all Gen A&#39;s do this 24-7 LMAO"
Bro made ads for the brainrotted 8 year olds 😭
Just wait till she learns about gooning
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=31"">0:31</a> the laugh 😭"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=39"">0:39</a> what’s Ohio? She probably didn’t pay attention in geography"
man gen alpha cant have childhoods they&#39;re constantly being bashed on by older people for being weird. this is an example.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=11"">0:11</a> I thought she said “you wiggie”😭"
I just came from the loop one😭
Those parents need to tattoo some common sense into their brain
See y’all in therapy during 2025
walmart REALLY wanted their customers back- (KEEP BOYCOTTING)!
It&#39;s brain arsenic at this point
This has zero reason to exist
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=1"">0:01</a> anyone notice the sign saying we are so back"
Vehicles in this video: 1998 blue bird International 3000 series school bus (vehicle used a lot by a main character)
is it just me or do i hear euphoria at the end??????
Bro the end made me scream.
walmart you may have lost a loyal shopper. yall have hit an all time low lmfao
"I hate to say this with my whole heart… but this is what my little siblings and their friends sound like to me. Heard one of them say ‘I’m cooked’ the other day while playing a video game and someone else said ‘glazed’ in a way that meant ‘over-complimenting’. I’m officially detached from the new culture, I guess. 🤷🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️"
"The only thing that made me laugh in this commercial, is that six freaking ding on the cringe counter lol"
Walmart too afraid to add the rest.
And this is why I shop at target more...
Grant Wisler try to warn us 💀
This ain’t Walmart bro💀
You had to include the girl mewing
Some of those things they say I only say it in social media and sometimes thats ironically
To the boomers that cooked this commercial up: GET OUT AND NEVER COOK AGAIN
"This isn’t even the whole ad, there’s a longer version of it…"
Am i the only one who sorta likes this add .-.
I feel like this got exponentially more cringe as it went on.
"Any other brits out there, Asda is run by the same people as Walmart. I&#39;m never shopping at Asda again."
Defund Walmart!
😭😭 what the hell was this <br><br>😭😭😭 This hurt my head
The last one would be count as 2 points
Why is the bus driver like her mom?? 💀💀
Remember when everyone found those chips ahoy ads cringe?
They trying to be cool so hard 😭🙏
"This commercial is trying so hard to be hip with the kids, it almost hurts. And it does the opposite of what it was trying to do, now I want to avoid Walmart like the plague."
This better have been worth the money
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=26"">0:26</a> nobody says 1900’s if they’re talking about 10’s-90’s🙏😭"
It got so cringe they had to censor it
1900’s is wild💀
Finally Walmart became sigma.
This is the 9/11 of ads
who tf in the board room approved of this and what was their goal? 😭
Of course they had to include the offensive “Ohio” slang term.
This genuinely made my stomach hurt and my throat feel strange. Shouldn&#39;t have watched this after eating.
This commercial Killed my dog and  sold me to North Korea.
I’m more surprised skibidi or sigma wasn’t mentioned
I feel like i got dumber watching this somehow
"Well this commercial worked at least, given how many people are cringe hating it."
"we don’t say slay, we say 🇦🇪"
I stole from Walmart while blasting this at full volume
There is no way that this is real.
bro i git got a walmart ad before this no joke
Welcome to Skibiti Elementary <br>Today&#39;s class is Rizzonomics 101.
Am I the only person who recognized the music from Kendrick Lamar’s euphoria in the end?
I can&#39;t f*cking believe they said ohio with full seriousness
Some of those worth double
Not cringe...<br><br><br><br><br><br>ITS SLAY PREPPY❤❤💅😍✨✨
walmart isn&#39;t GOING back to normal
"It’s so odd that she says “what’s Ohio,” like, I get not knowing the meaning but do you not know Ohio exists? Lol"
Thank you for adding that sound really loud ringing slide whistle towards the end. Now I won&#39;t hear anymore cringe ever
"What happened to the zany over the top ads from the 90s... <br><br>How we have failed to create, to influence, to inspire...<br><br>I feel to old not just for this generation but for the world this age have transformed into...<br>😢"
Ain’t no way this is real 😭😭😭
it looks like someone who went on tiktok comments to make this commercial
"i feel myself losing braincells, why walmart i hate you now😭<br>btw why is euphoria playing at the end"
i cannot believe they made this omg
&quot;Maximum aura points&quot;
"We’re getting older and are repeating that our newer generation slang is getting worse, just like our older generation told us about their slang, and continues with the older older generation, then the older older older generation, etc."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=1"">0:01</a> The board says &quot;we are so back&quot;"
There is no way this is a real fucking ad. It&#39;s like grubhub all over again
I saw this and now I shop at Costco.
"It should have been 100,000,000,000,000,000,000."
This counter dosent ring enough
Tf you mean &quot;what is Ohio&quot; you know what Ohio is 😭😭😭
This is why I steal from walmart and shop at target
"wrong, the cringe counter is actually infinity"
Not enough sins. MOAR SINS!!
They really hired Kamala Harris to play the bus driver
What was the little euphoria jumpscare at the end there
WE ARE GOING BACK TO THAT PHASE OF YOUTUBE
Guess the ad works if this is even a video.
i don’t wanna go to walmart anymore
As if I didn&#39;t already hate Walmart enough...
WHY IS THE BEGINNING OF EUPHORIA PLAYING AT THE END
I think I’d rather have the fish tanks then this ☠️
BRO I TYRING TO WATCH DESPICABLE ME 4 AND THEN THIS STUPOD AD POPS UO IN THE THEATER😭
"Cringe counter: 43 for every second of this ad. No, add 1 for Walmart, so 44"
The noose is calling me
were losing brainsells with this one!
See Walmart stocks go up about 14 percent each year. But with this? Id say sell all your investments from Walmart
"glad I&#39;m not a native English speaker, therefore not having that shitty ad lol"
Poor victorian children died watching this video
If it was up to me the counter would be 11
This generation be messed up
wouldve added more points at that little girl saying &quot;ohio&quot;
Now I see why everyone don&#39;t like Walmart
"this is inaccurate, that score should be at least 700"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=31"">0:31</a> Okay Mickey Mouse!! 😍😍😍😍"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=9"">0:09</a> &quot;UAE&quot;"
I wish I could take back the seconds I wasted watching this.
"Why are y&#39;all suprised? YOU guys made the brainrot words. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think this commercial is terrible, but still."
look Walmart. if you&#39;re broke just say it
Sam Walton would be ashamed
I watched this in deep pain
Walmart tries to go the same path as grubhub.
This gave me depression 😂 <br>Im joking walmart
why does it turn into euphoria💀
"I didn’t even have to type in Walmart and it showed up<br>Glad I wasn’t the only semi-sane person left after being forced to watch this<br><br>Actually I lied, I covered my eyes for the most of it but the audio now makes me hear monkeys in the walls"
At least they didn’t say skibidi or rizz
You forgot to add one in the 1900s line
this is not skibidi this is brainrot
"Brace yourselves, iPad babies are coming…"
oh but that was kinda cute
why do they always try to fit in 😭😭😭
This can&#39;t be an actual ad...is it?
No bus driver looks like that c&#39;mon
"The cringe has DoT damage, I still feel the pain"
Unpleasant made the script 💀
EUPHORIA MENTIONED 🔥
&quot;Welp... geuss I&#39;ll die.&quot;
YO THIS IS ACTUALLY REAL?!? walmart has brainrot bro💀💀💀
Is it just me or is this a red flag that the bus driver is “grooming” the students?😳
Some mf studied 4 years of marketing and made this?
I think every frame of this counts as cringe counter. So probably a couple thousand
Ya&#39;ll going bankrupt or something?
<b>Searches up how to not be a gen alpha</b>
"Walmart, the desperate for relevance company."
No. This can’t be real. THIS CAN’T BE REALL!!!!😱😱😱😱
My brain is hurting
Yeah manman started playing euphoria at the end
“What ohi-“ STOP. 🔫
&quot;Everyones really killing themselves&quot;<br><br>WTF?
can we split gen z into two generations i am totally lost
No way this is for real 😭😭😭
My last brain cell 😢
Humanity is cooked as we know it
The bus driver is a YouTuber but i don’t remember her name 😭😭I’m pretty sure she’s the one who pretends to be her hispanic mom
When i saw the meme i thought it was edited...<br>Who&#39;s even the audience of these ads?
somebody stop walmart.
dude last time i heard them say rizzy rizz 🙁🙁
Actual brainrot it hurts
i&#39;m switching to target now
Atleast it wasn’t that bad. But ain’t no way walmart did this.
I refuse to watch this so I’m commenting in hopes that someone else will explain the video to me.
Do the same thing with Amazon back to school commercials. Those commercials are annoying.
"not brainrot enough, no skibidi or Kai cenat"
Ohio started as meme now people using it like it some kind of real meaningful word
Is it just me who finds the  bus driver so hot
“Poppin the preppy vibes” made me shit myself on god 😭🙏🗣️🐴
Gen Alpha be Like:
I&#39;m sure I know I did NOT hear &quot;maximum aura points&quot; and &quot;ohio&quot;... 😳 I MUST be high 😭
This video hurts me physically
"one has to wonder, what does this ad have to do with Walmart anyways?"
it is so damn awkward everytime people try to speak like the think gen z kids do. 💀
I refuse this to believe this is real.
help i got a walmart right b for this lol
Maximum aura points     no cap you ain&#39;t cringe or ohio    😂
this ad is worse than grubhubs ad where they fucking dance while eating
There was way more than 6 😭
"Son, whats a &quot;Fire fit&quot;?"
Aura goes crazy
Trying to be &quot;Hipe with the kids&quot; Is definitely something... It&#39;s not positive but it&#39;s something
Aura debt for generations 😂😂😂😂
As a general rule alpha myself I declare that this is not goated
Where’s the part where they all sing the Skibidi Toilet Song on the way home?
Bro this generation is doomed 😭
nahhh there was WAYYYY more than that
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=31"">0:31</a> PLEASE tell me why she let out a fucking Mickey Mouse “Uh-Huh!” out of her mouth."
"The video is wrong, cause the actual counter: 600"
needs more skibidi
This is why people steal from Walmart
"It’s true though, this is how y’all sound now"
My count seemed higher but some have higher tolerance I suppose.
Glad I&#39;m not American
Euphoria plays at the end?
Brainrot commercial indeed.
I never thought cringe could hurt me both mentally and physically
She say what’s Ohio? That is a state ma’am
Where&#39;s the Death Star when you need it?
"Missed where she says &quot;chat&quot; at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=6"">0:06</a>"
Why it turn into euphoria at the end 💀
I saw this at the movie theater 💀
You forgot the part with the mewing girl
"This slang isn&#39;t getting us no where in life, and thats coming from someone born in 2005(me). That&#39;s why I perfer to use less slang, and try my best to increase my grammer instead of dumbing it down"
Are these terms actually cringe or are we just not used to them?
Hey that’s the woman who marries like twenty men and constantly creates drama from it. Nice pick Walmart! Personally I think Gal would’ve been a better option but it’s not the first time corpos don’t listen to their audience.
What has this world come to
OHIO IS A STATE DID YOU FORGET YOUR STATES MRS JOHNSON
Multiply the cringe points by 500
“What’s Ohio”
"Why Walmart, why couldn’t it be the chips ahoy ads that stay cringe 😢"
"How the Hell do they not know ehat Ohio is, it&#39;s a state in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!"
"euphoria, them superpowers get neutralized we can only watch in silence, the market we once knew is brainrot and now spiralin your movin just like a gen alpha every antic is feeling distasteful"
im stealing next time I go to walmart
this is the same as the “on fleek” commercials i saw a couple of years ago. it’s just unfunny execs wanting to get attention by making people purposefully cringe so it can stir up buzz
thank god I don’t have walmart in my area (I live in ny)
Humanity is failing. This generation is DOOMED.
Walmart got the call
Why can&#39;t I find the ad on the Walmart Youtube Channel?
yeah I think I’m done. this is the final straw for me.
Not her + maximum aura
The cringe counter is actually :11
You should’ve used RDR2 low honor sound
who let the skibidi toilet kids direct a commercial
ads in america:
Gen Alpha? More like Gen Beta
I am losing my high Iq 💀
man target on top
I saw this ad in a theater and it went on WAY too long.
"As a gen z, I hate this."
"Oh goodness no. I don’t know if you watch Grant Whistler, but he made a parody on commercials like this. I was hoping I never encounter commercial like this. If you wanna watch this video, it’s called. commercials trying to be hip with the kids."
"To be far, kids these days actually talk like this."
Um excuse me I think I bought the wrong tv
They used the Ohio meme in 2024<br>Why
"This is just slang, not brainrot."
I think you forgot three zeros
not enough counters
Oh no my fellow millenials made this. God we are uncool.
When y’all make these videos about brain rot you still say them brain rot words as well
Did she ask a child what Ohio is😭
"My girlfriend and I saw this the longest version of it ever in the AMC. Theater, cringe is not even the word. I was looking around the theater at other people  are you f*<b>***</b> kidding me? This is the craziest garbage"
How many more commercials like these are we gonna get before the creators realize no one likes them or finds them funny
"I can only speak for myself, but I cringed a lot more than 6 times."
whoever made this needs to be punished
There were way more than just six
"erm, what the sigma"
I watched an ad before this video :/
We dont say slayz we say
“What’s an Ohio”
I feel like kms rn after seeing this
bro walmart if ur going bankrupt then just tell us this is the most cringe ahhh ad
This is why God hides in heaven
Thank fuck I don&#39;t watch ads.
"How do you do, fellow kids?"
What have I just visually seen
Gen z people as advertisers
glad they didnt say skibidi
Im shopping at Winn Dixie and Aldis now
What r they trying to advertise here 😭😭
"…….im scared, I’m genuinely scared"
900 Sub❤
i feel like crying
Target’s better anyways.
Walmart tweaking 😭
I am no longer shopping at walmart
Phone yeeted <br>YouTube deleted<br>Therapist greeted<br>Braincells needed

Why was the beginning of Euphoria at the end lol
Why&#39;s it cringe if thats what everyone craves?
Cancel walmart
Nuh uh imma take their advertising privileges from them I’m done

What product did they even advertise? 😂😂
Tf is Kendrick doing at the end
<b>screams and pulls my fucking hair out</b>
Wait this is from Walmart…? 💀💀💀
"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in<br>&quot;advanced&quot; countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread<br>psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in<br>&quot;advanced&quot; countries."
Now you know how it feel Gen Z. lol.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I38F0mlZ7Hw&amp;t=11"">0:11</a> bro im gen alpha and i dont even know wth that means 💀"

Ain’t no way they made that shit
This is why targets better
The child is called &quot;Taylen&quot;?
wayy more then 6 buddy
GYATT! Now that&#39;s rizz!
you missed multiple cringe counters
"I don&#39;t understand, is it like her mom is the school bus driver?"
Can you add one for that vocal fry
"Walmart, and the white house fr be like:<br><br>&quot;Hey what&#39;s good young fellas?&quot; And it just shows an old guy with 90s skater clothing on 💀<br><br>They Trina be cool with the kids and the younger generations, it ain&#39;t working, it&#39;s fr cringe 💀"
Bs<br>That bus driver would have quit by the 3rd stop and would’ve had an OF made before lunchtime
Who TF says &quot;that ate&quot; I prefer slay
is that the fucking euphoria intro at the end
Grant wisler was correct
Of course they had to throw the cap in there . Ridiculous word . People just make up words and they sound very ignorant.
LMAOOO WHATT?!?!
this hurts to watch
Dude I&#39;m gen A and I don&#39;t even know any slang
Bruh our generation is cooked
Brain nourishment
i don&#39;t even know what she said.
NO WAY THIS WAS AN AD
This isn&#39;t Kristi Noem.

Is that the beginning of euphoria or am I crazy
This generation&#39;s f*cked.

why is there a grown adult siting next to a kid?
"<b>Chat, Is This Real?1!</b>"
Tried to sneak euphoria at the end
"It’s makin’ me cringe, Dutch!"
Boomers seeing this: 😭😭
"Six? SIX??? literally every action, outfit, and word that occurred in this was cringe"
a grown woman can ask what ohio is now
Sylvan Ville

My cringe counter was wayy higher but ok
"I’d give this ad a 7/10, for not having any politics 😊👍"
I think the counter should read 10 instead (if you were to count every time a cringe slang term is used)
This commercial is cringy and it&#39;s very bad telling that thisjs is the wrong season and it&#39;s supposed to be summer
Ain&#39;t no way 💀🙏
Rip walmart

😂
How is this ad cringey?
Oh 😮 io
I’m brain kil itsell
its garbage
It wasn&#39;t that bad
I gotta give respect to the trailer for not disabling like or comments.
"Sonic: &quot;Uhhh... meow?&quot;<br><b>HE TRIED TO WARN US, BUT WE DID NOT LISTEN</b>"
Sonic’s “Uh...Meow?” was actually a warning to us for this movie
"Don’t cry because it happened, Smile because it ended."
People: This is a musical or a horror movie? <br><br>Director: <b>Yes</b>
At this point I&#39;m starting to think that making bad character design choices is just a marketing tactic
At least 40% of the comments: We owe Sonic an apology
The book is way better because it doesn&#39;t exist
"If you think watching this trailer on your phone is bad, imagine the people sitting in the theater innocently waiting for the previews and having no idea what they&#39;re about to witness."
Watches cats trailer<br><br><br>Me to sonic trailer: <b>Perhaps we treated you too harshly</b>
Paramount :We can make worst CGI<br>Universal : Hold My Cats
"If this was shown on plane, people would still walk out."
Me: Can you make a blockbuster please?<br><br><br>Universal: uhhhh.. Meow?
Me: Mom can we get a cat?:<br>Mom: We have cats at home<br>The cats at home:
"Sonic: Uhh, Meow?<br>He warned us about this people. He warned us all"
God&#39;s punishing us this whole year because we made this monstrosity last year
Sonic: Uhh...Meow <br>Universal Studio: I got you fam.
<b><i>I think that&#39;s enough live action movies for my lifetime...</i></b>
Either I really just watched this or someone drugged my pasta
I remember seeing this trailer in theaters for the first time. My family and I had a difficult time holding in our laughter.
When you realize Sonic was actually trying to warn us.<br>&quot;Uhh... meow?&quot;
Sonic tried to warn us by saying “ uh... meow?”
Me: No one can ruin cats for me<br><br>Universal Pictures: Is that a challenge??
imagine being someone who was actually hyped for this movie to come out
This is what the people in the birdbox saw before they die.
"When taylor swift said &quot;I&#39;ll be the actress starring in your bad dreams&quot;, she was trying to warn us."
I see somebody drew inspiration from all the positive feedback the Sonic Movie was getting
"Almost four years later and I still can’t believe people actually looked at this and thought “Oh yeah, this will definitely be a hit”."
And here I was about to celebrate my first week of sobriety.
This looks like if they based a whole movie about face swapping yours with your cats
“Lol ew the Sonic movie looks terrible.”<br><br>CATS: <b><i>”Uhhh... m e o w?”</i></b>
Sonic movie: Fixes and improves just about everything wrong with it.<br>Cats movie: We don&#39;t do that here...
when did animation turn into a contest to make the most terrifying creations possible
"<b>THIS WENT THROUGH AN ANIMATION TEAM, A WRITING TEAM, A CHOREOGRAPHIC TEAM, A STORYBOARDING TEAM, THE DIRECTOR HIMSELF AND NONE OF THEM THOUGHT, &quot;YEAH NO THIS MIGHT BE HORRIBLE&quot;?</b>"
&quot;Uh meow&quot; takes a whole different meaning now. Thanks sonic
<b>”hey man should they be cats or humans?”</b><br><br>director: <b>”both”</b>
"Director: ok so I want the characters to be cats<br>Artist/designer: a what?<br>Director: a cat, you’ve seen one before right?<br>Artist/designer: uh....yeah obviously"
If you stare into the void long enough the void stares back
"Congratulations Universal, you have just created the next big meme of 2019. Brace yourself for the storm."
Me: &quot;Thanks for making me not want to kill myself&quot; <br><br> <b>Card declines</b><br><br>Therapist: &quot;Watch this&quot;
Warner Bros:  it chapter 2 will scare so many kids<br><br><br>Universal: hold my milk bowl
Everybody gangsta till this is what we find in Area 51
“Do you want live-action or complete animation?”<br>“Yes”
I don’t see why people hate it. It seems like a good horror movie.
This Cat in the hat 2 trailer looks like something I would see beyond my deepest nightmares.
Forget Area 51 let’s raid universal studios and see what aliens they have there
Annabelle and Pennywise: We will bring much horror to 2019!<br>CATS: Hold my catnip...
So many amazing actors and singers just wasting their talents away.
"Sonic The Hedgehog: “Uh, meow...?”<br><br><br>The Cats: “You called?”"
Me walking into Area 51 looking for cat-girls:<br><b>sees this</b><br>&quot;no&quot;
Patient : I am terrified of humaoid Cats.<br>Therapist: there&#39;s no such thing as humanoid cats.<br><br>Humanoid cats:
Mom: we’re not buying a cat we have cats at home.<br>The cats at home:
"<b>Dear God, it&#39;s like if Steven King tried to make a Dr. Seuss movie</b>"
This looks like the most expensive SNL sketch ever made.
"2009: Wow, Avatar was amazing! I wonder how CGI will look in 10 years?<br><br>2019:"
"My sister cried after seeing this, she even became afraid of cats."
They could legitimately turn this into a horror movie...
"Paramount Pictures: Boy, my sonic movie is so damn<br>creepy <br><br>Universal Pictures: Hold my furry costume"
<b>Universal Pictures</b> : releases CATS trailer<br><b>Everyone</b> : what did you bring to this cursed land
<b>Movie Cuties comes out:</b><br><br>Literally everybody hating on Cats:<br>&quot;perhaps i treated you harshly&quot;
"Therapist: James Corden Cat can&#39;t hurt you, it&#39;s not real.<br>James Corden Cat:"
"So many great actors, such god-awful nightmare fuel of style."
When sonic said “meow?” He was warning us
"Imagine being given $95 million, but you still get outdone by a dancing cat and a blind Turkish man with drum!🤣"
"This movie is gonna spawn a lot of memes, and that I can appreciate"
The actors in this movie: <b>&quot;I&#39;m going to be a star!&quot;</b><br>This movie: <b>I&#39;m going to end this man&#39;s whole career!&quot;</b>
Sonic Movie: uh... meow?<br>Universal: Write that down! Write that down!<br>Edit: Coming back to say the movie was shit.
"&quot;This Christmas, you will believe&quot; That Hell is very much real."
Jennifer: “a new day...has begun”<br>Jason: “jAsON DEruLo”
what the hell is happening i feel like I just snorted 10 pounds of furry cocaine
Paramount: We&#39;ve officially made the freakiest character in history <br><br>Universal: Ummm... Meow?
I saw this trailer half an hour after it came out. Seeing the internet&#39;s reaction in real time was beautiful
Now I can see why Area 51 wanted to keep the anime cat people from the public
“Sonic CGI is so scary”<br><br>Universal: “wanna bet?”
"Sonic: Uh, meow?<br>He tried to warn us, but we all just ridiculed him. Look at where we are now."
Whos here because you saw Jason A video and was curious?
"It&#39;s wonderful that Hollywood has become so tolerant and diverse, now even my sleep paralysis demons can become movie stars!"
Just imagine all of the memes that are going to come from this
This just tells you theatre and film are two entirely different media
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U&amp;t=144"">2:24</a> was the best part"
"On second thought, sonic looks pretty good"
This confirms that we aren’t ready for what’s in Area 51.
Sonic: &quot;I have the ugliest uncanny character design in the entire CGI history!&quot;<br>Cats: &quot;Hold my milk!&quot;
"Chip: “I think we’re in the valley…..The Uncanny Valley.”<br>Dale: “The what?”<br>Chip: “Do you remember that weird animation style in the early 2000s where everything looked real, but nothing looked RIGHT?”<br>Dale: “Oh yeah, that stuff was creepy……”<br>Chip: “Well, I think this is where they ended up.”"
This looks like a Doctor Who episode you’d skip when you rewatch the season
This movie is the visual representation of drinking orange juice after brushing your teeth
IT Chapter 2: I&#39;m going to be the scariest movie of the year!<br><br>Cats: Hold my cat nip
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U&amp;t=140"">2:20</a> &quot;This holiday season<br> you will believe&quot;<br><br><br><br>That it&#39;s all down hill from here"
Sonic the hedgehog: scariest live action movie of 2019<br>Cats movie: hold my milk
"From the director of two critically acclaimed masterpieces, comes the payment for the sins of man."
"&quot;This Christmas, you will believe&quot;<br><br><br>I believe that i will have nightmares"
The fact they managed to get all these big stars to be in this film is such a surprise
This is what the people in Bird Box were seeing...
I’m glad they’re making a movie about the demons I run from after I shut the light off in a room.
"Your director was so preoccupied with whether or not he could, he didn’t stop to think if he should."
Mom can we have garbage<br><br><br>We have garbage at home<br><br><br>Garbage at home:<br><br><br>Edit: 64 likes OMG!!
Wow “It Chapter Two” really changed from the first movie
The Cat in the Hat is the only realistic human looking cat allowed to exist.
"Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn&#39;t stop to think if they should"
I have to applaud Universal for keeping the comments open
kid: mom can we get a pet?<br>mom: there’s cats at the house <br>cats at the house:
Real cats need to make a film called &quot;Humans&quot; in revenge lol
Put that thing back where it came from or so help me
My beloved white cat died 4 years ago... This is wonderful trailer... Thank you &lt;3
Everyone: The sonic design sucks. Nothing can be as bad as the sonic design.<br><br>Universal: Observe
Cats movie trailer: Has nearly 250k dislikes<br><br>YouTube rewind 2018: <b>You&#39;re gonna have to bump those numbers up. Those are rookie numbers.</b>
It looks like one of those wierd dreams that we&#39;ll never remember the next morning
Me: <b>mom can we get some cats?</b><br>Mom: <i>we already have cats at home</i><br>The cats at home:
The characters look like they&#39;re just using a snapchat filter
It 2: The scariest movie of 2019<br><br>Cats: Hold my Meow Mix
Hey how about instead we just make it fully animated since it’s already 90% CG?
Coronavirus: I&#39;m your worst nightmare👹<br>Cats: hold my milk🥛
therapist: the james corden cat isn’t real. it can’t hurt you.<br><br>the james corden cat: 🐈
"putting everyone&#39;s favorite actors in, just makes it more disturbing."
It appears as though 2019 is the year for weird-looking live-action movies.
Truth: You haven&#39;t seen the movie.
“Just because It can be done doesn’t mean it should be done”
"Me: mom, i want a cat girl<br>Mom: we have cat girl at home<br>Cat girl at home:"
IT 2: I&#39;ll be the scariest movie of 2019<br>Cats: Hold my litterbox
They ask &#39;Can we?&#39;<br>But they never ask &#39;Should we?&#39;
IT 2: I&#39;m going to be the scariest movie of the year.<br>CATS:
Every actor is announced:<br>Me: HOW DID YOU GET DRAGGED INTO THIS?!?!?!
it looks like how those weird 17th century painters thought cats looked
"You know, I wouldn’t have minded if they brought back hand-drawn animation for these kind of things"
30s - 50s: let&#39;s make our cartoon characters as appealing as possible<br><br>90s- 2010s: let&#39;s improve our cg technology to make it as believable as possible<br><br>2019: Anthro-Uncanny nightmare fuel.
CATS: it&#39;s out of the bag.<br><br>US: Please put it back in.
This i going to be that movie that everyone looks at you weirdly when you buy tickets to
I never thought they’d take black panther in this direction
Bro imagine walking late at night and seeing these monstrosities dancing 😂
As a cat this is offensive.
Me: do you want to make a normal movie?<br>Universal: no... no I don’t think I will
These comments are why im here
I&#39;m sueing! They have no right to use my sleep paralysis demons without my permission!
Sonic told us.....he said meow.... He warned us about this movie... We didnt listen
We all owe the sonic movie a big big apology
"&quot;It is the worst thing happened to cats since dogs&quot;~~~~<br>&quot;Ricky Gervais&quot;, 21st Century on Earth"

"Was in a theatre with some family to watch the lion king when this... THIS! Popped up on screen during the various ads.

Universal pictures: 😐<br>Film crew: 😅<br>Viewers: 😭👌<br>Tom hooper: 🙂??
"<b>My shrink:</b> &quot;CGI Feline Jason Derulo isn&#39;t real, he couldn&#39;t hurt you&quot;<br><br><b>CGI Feline Jason Derulo:</b>"
so this is how furries will look after raiding area 51
"Poor, poor kids that will be scarred for life by this Lovecraftian hellscape"
This movie dropped right before the pandemic hit. We should have known it was a warning for what was to come.
-911 what’s your emergency<br>-....<br>-Hello?<br>- <b>Cats trailer sounds in the background</b>
"The singing and choreography will be fantastic but the visuals...honey, I&#39;m gon have to listen to this blind"
I feel like “YOU WILL BELIEVE” is a threat... I’m scared.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U&amp;t=48"">0:48</a> I didn&#39;t know know that my sleep paralysis demon was also an actor! Good job Bob!"
The whole trailer looks like those weird medieval cats paintings with human like faces.
Me: Mommy I want cat girls from Area 51<br><br>Mom: We have cat girls at home<br><br>Cat girls at home :
“Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could they didn&#39;t stop to think if they should!” - Jeff Goldblum
"Mom: we’re not buying a cat we have cats at home.<br>The cats at home: 👁👄👁"
And here i was thinking that  &quot;IT chapter 2&quot; was gonna be the scariest movie of 2019
And I thought the Sonic Design was terrifying but this.....this is a whole new level man
They actually made this so Sonic would look better
This may have been one of the last films to ever be seen in a movie theater. I’m glad the theaters went out on a high note.
What in the world did I just witness with my own two eyes
"…on second thought, maybe that old Sonic movie design isn&#39;t so bad."
Taylor swift wasn’t lying when she said “I’m the actress starring in your bad dreams”
"I remember the day this came into theatures, my cousin and I were trying to decide whether we should watch this or Jumanji 2, and I took one look at the poster and I got this terrible feeling that we would both be scarred for life if we watched this and tbh I think she had the same feeling"
Universal made a movie about my sleep paralysis demon?
How is it that the trailer for “Cats” is WAY more disturbing than the trailer for “IT: Chapter 2”?
"To all of you real cats out there, humanity owes you an apology. I am so sorry."
"Me, being tortured: <b>*Flinches, expecting to be stretched or something*</b><br>Them: <b>*Puts on Cats*</b><br>Me: <b>*SCREECH... MAKE IT STOP...*</b>"
"coulda made something magnificent with practical effects, makeup, and set design.<br><br><br>instead we get this nightmare fuel."
IT 2: I&#39;m going to be the most terrifying and disturbing movie in 2019.<br>Cats: Hold my milk.
Petition to Copyright Strike Universal for stealing Sonics new redesign
was universal on drugs when they&#39;re making this<br><br><br>no seriously
This makes me feel like I&#39;m receiving forbidden knowledge.
"Now i realize who Sonic was calling to when he said ‘Meow’, another creature equally as hideous"
finally a horror movie that is so scary that the trailer sends chills down my spine
If I literally filmed my self laughing for 10 hours it wouldn&#39;t be that much of a nightmare. U don&#39;t wanna see me laugh
"What we&#39;re expecting from Area 51: Cool alien weapons, Minecraft 2, Team Fortress 3<br>What we&#39;re gonna find:"
"My dream was to see Neko Girls in real life, but now I changed my mind"
"Cat:<br><br>Director: <b>Eats, snorts, and bathes in crack and looks at the cat</b><br><br>Director:"
"I’ve got bad news for everyone, this movie has been sold out everywhere. you’ll never be able to get your hands on this masterpiece"
"Producer: Can you cgi a cat?<br><br>Animator: I’ve never seen a cat before, but sure, why not?"
Humans: <b>Posts &quot;Cats&quot; official movie trailer</b><br>Real Cats: I am a joke to you?
Hey guys I think we treated sonic too harshly :/
"This may be an unpopular opinion, but I truly believe this film to be the peak of cinema. When this first released, I watched in theatres with my pet cat Barthalemeow, who is notorious for not liking any films. However, thirty minutes into this masterpiece, my cat and I were in tears, embracing each other over the magnificence of this film. When Idris Elba showed up, I let out an audible gasp, and my groin ached, truly I was witness to something beyond human comprehension. The only thing that could make this even better, would be to release the butthole cut, however I understand that seeing that may be just like seeing the Ark of the Covenant, and could spell the end of humanity. Two years later and I have still not recovered from this life changing experience, my cat is now a Spanish Guru, and teaches the way of the butthole<br>Love, Jamie"
I don’t think this is what people meant when they were asking for genetically engineered catgirls...
Forget about Area 51. We need to storm Hollywood and see who the f*ck has been in charge these last years.
I actually thought this was going to be a horror film. It sure looks like one tbh.
I’m only here for Jennifer Hudson’s vocals 😍😍 She would have ate it in a different film 🤷🏾‍♀️
Oh dear.<br>I can see most of the money was put into paying the actors and not for the effects. <br><br>Also &quot;Random Furry Joke Here.&quot;
Elon Musk never imagined this when he wanted to create catgirls
If this is not a prequel to The Cat in the Hat I&#39;m not watching
"This reminds me of one of those nightmares I had when I was little that I can&#39;t get over with even after months. <br><br><br>Hell, I hate those memories..."
Yo those snapchat filters are getting out of hand
1960: we will have flying cars in the future <br><br>2019:
Focus group: &quot;we liked the part where the fat one is stupid and gets hurt&quot;<br>Studio head: &quot;that&#39;s going in the trailer for sure&quot;

"If Jason Derulo doesn’t sing “jAsOn DeRulO” at least once during this movie, it’s canceled."
First couple seconds: What can go wrong? Yes Cats is a weird play but its-<br><br>Sees CGI Cat: no...
"Forget the trailer for Stephen King´s &quot;It 2&quot; ,this is the most scary shit,I´ve seen all year!<br>Hell,even Pennywise propably said himself: &quot;Nope,I´m going back to my sewer and won´t come back for another 27 years.&quot;"
"Wow none of the actors, production staff, director anyone thought this is scary? <br>They all made it there through connections it seems.<br>Cats having broad shoulders, rounded butts, no snout. <br>Oh God......"
"IT Chapter 2: I&#39;m the most terrifying, spine-chilling, nightmare-inducing movie of 2019<br><br>Cats: Hold my beer"
IT chapter two<br>everyone: gonna be the scariest movie of the year<br>Cats<br>:hold my beer
This looks like a face swap with you and your cat
"This should be considered a violent attack on Ian McKellen, our own national treasure"
Typed in Cats to see cat videos to cheer up.<br>......<br>youtube: got just the thing for you.
Sonic: We&#39;ve created the worst nightmare fuel ever!<br>Cats: Hold my catnip...
"Oh, they made a movie about my sleep paralysis demons."
"Almost two years later, this movie made me realise something: God had not abandoned us, we have abandoned him."
"Showed this to my Cat, She’s a dog now."
Me: &quot;Mom can I have a cat?&quot;<br>Mom: &quot;We have <b>Cats</b> at home&quot;<br><b>Cats</b> at home:
"WHY, are they releasing a Horror movie, on Christmas??"
"Proof that Humans evolved from Cats and not Monkeys, honestly this film looks amazing."
What if they make a movie called &quot;humans&quot; and it&#39;s just regular people with cat faces?
I clicked on this and went straight to the comments.
Me: mom can we go watch Garfield <br><br>Mom: We have Garfield at home<br><br>Garfield at home:
Who came here searching for the legendary &quot;If I pirated this movie I would still ask for a refund&quot;
I can&#39;t wait! I just need to find a theater that offers rollercoaster seat restraints and psychedelic drugs so I can get the full experience.
“This Holiday Season you will believe.”<br>I believe God has abandoned us because we’ve created sin
"I fear no man, but that thing..... it scares me"
"Guys stop complaining abou this trailer, my friend died and i put this trailer in the  hospital&#39;s tv, he lived again and turned off the tv"
I fear no man. But that thing...<br><br><br><b>LEANS FORWARD</b><br><br><br><br><br><b>IT SCARES ME</b>
All I can ask is<br><br>“Is this what the crazy cat ladies see?”
So you’re telling me all these talented people thought this was a good idea
"<b>Mistakes Make You Stronger</b><br><br><br><br>The Director After Making The Movie: <b>hulk</b>"
Just when you thought Mike Myers as the Cat in the Hat couldn&#39;t be anymore nightmare fuel.....
The trailer doesn&#39;t explain the movie at all it&#39;s just a bunch of cats singing and dancing around the place
This is the scariest horror movie trailer I have EVER seen. No way IT: Chapter 2 can beat this or anything else for that matter.
The end is near. Tell your family you love them.
"me: mom, can we have a cat?<br>mom: no, we have cats at home<br><b>cats at home:</b>"
i forgot about this trailer so i came back here to laugh at the comments
God and I thought I wanted to die after i saw live action sonic
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U&amp;t=7"">0:07</a> the second i saw this trailer i was watching with my sister. This was the hardest ive laughed in my entire life i think"
When you faceswap with your pet
You know it&#39;s bad when even the furry community is disturbed.
That is the creepiest thing I’ve seen this year. WTF?
If aliens ever got ahold of this it would set their research back hundreds of years
"&quot;This Christmas, you will believe&quot;. I believe a group of Producers are soon to be fired."
After CATS trailer got 200k + Dislike<br><br><br><br>Sonic Trailer: Cha Cha Real Smooth
"This trailer sent me to therapy, and mostly because I&#39;ll never be able to look at Gandalf the same way again"

This’ll be like that Christmas present you get from your creepy uncle.
"Someone get ian mckellen out of there. Put him back in the Gandalf robes and hat, immediately."
Sonic tried to warn us with &quot;uuh meow?&quot; But we were all blind
How was the movie ? It’s been four years and I’ve never even heard of this. I found this trailer randomly lol
I’m gonna quote something that JacksFilms said:<br><br><br><br>WHY COULDN’T THEY WEAR COSTUMES!?
"Elder Scrolls 6 looks dope, these Khajhit look so Realistic!"
"People in 1951: we will have flying cars in the future <br>2019:<br><br><br><br><br><br>EDIT: Er sorry about the year, fixed it up. Plus thanks for likes<br>ANOTHER EDIT: it doesn’t creep me out, but I do find it a smidge odd, I see why it scares people but I think dance is good just look"
I was expecting this to be people in costumes and makeup and be taking place in a junkyard so it would have the same feel as the stage musical and the 1998 movie did.
1980: We will have flying cars in 2019 <br><br>2019:
Just a quick explanation.<br>They look this horrific because this is the cheapest way to turn actors into cats without modelling cat faces and new body shapes. You could say the same for the sonic movie.<br><br>As the FBI we&#39;re still investigating further though.
Swear they just used the snapchat face-swap  filter with models of khajiits from the elder scrolls
"This movie isn&#39;t trash, It&#39;s an entire junkyard."
This scared me more than the IT Chapter Two trailer
This is the worst thing to happen on cats since dogs<br>-Ricky Gervais
I think what’s sad is that someone had to watch this before releasing it and still thought it was a good idea😑
Words cant describe how much I love this film but numbers can -10000/10
We have angered God and this is our punishment.
If you ever feel like no one will accept you think of this <br><br>This movie had to be approved by hundreds of people.😐
You don’t smile. You don’t frown. You just stare blankly in horror...
Happy 5th Anniversary to the Cats trailer!
This was a hilarious joke guys.... but April Fools was months ago.
"<b>This Christmas, you will believe</b> <br>At least Universal got one thing right; I now DO believe... <br><br><br>that hell exists"
Time to figure out which of the producers is a secret furry
They should have cast Megan Markle to really put the cherry of horror on top. 😂
"Attention all gamers, THE FURRYS ARE FIGHTING BACK!"
This makes black Christmas look like a family night movie...
This is what happens when you inject  liquid cocaine into the veins of your minimum wage employees
"Son : Why do cat faces look the same, dad?<br>Dad : Because it&#39;s scary if their faces are different from each other"
I am trying to figure out what I just witnessed.
Hey...Elon?<br>This is not what we meant when we said &quot;create cat girls&quot;...
Wanna break up with your girlfriend take her to this movie
"The executives : &quot;People love cat videos so much, lets make a movie about humanoid cats. They will love it even more.&quot;"

"Shrek walks up<br>&quot;this is the part&quot; *blows out torch &quot;where the investors, run away&quot;"

This bombed so bad it should be held on trial in The Hague for crimes against humanity.
i took my girlfriend to this movie in theatres. I don’t have a girlfriend anymore
"&quot;Do you think God stays in heaven because he, too, lives in fear of what he&#39;s created?&quot;"
&quot;This holiday season you will believe&quot; that practical effects are better than cg.  Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
"I dont understand y all anymore , you dont want people to be cats bcs it looks terrifying , y all dont want real cats bcs you dont like the animation . THEN WHAT DO Y ALL LIKE? :))"
"The uncanny valley reminds me of the live action Sonic trailer.  Except ironically, it doesn’t have anyone going “Uh... Meow?”"
our kids are gonna look back at 2019 in the future and say “wtf is this”
there&#39;s gonna be some really messed up fanfaction made about this isn&#39;t there oh god
The entire movie plot: hoomans dressed as cats singing every 0.1 seconds
why am I scared? should I be scared? I never thought they could successfully make a horror musical. well they did it. congrats
This movie should&#39;ve been animated instead. <br><br>I mean COMPLETELY animated like Toy Story. Not filmed in front of a green screen and put into post for 5 or 6 years.
I felt more comfortable getting hit by a car than watching this video.
I came for the trailer and stayed for the comments. <br><br>I was not disappointed.
I showed this to my therapist and I think he needs therapy.
You know...maybe that movie version of Sonic didn&#39;t look that bad after all...
"&quot;This Christmas, you will believe&quot; Yes, I will believe that god has deserted us for good"
"I used to be a cat person. After watching this trailer, I&#39;m not even sure if I&#39;m a person."
"You were so preoccupied that you could, you didn&#39;t stop to think if you should.<br>  - Ian Malcolm<br><br>Edit: thanks for the likes!"
Thanks to this trailer I had a dream last night that my cat began to walk on it&#39;s back legs and sing to me
"If they added longer fur it would look 110% better. The Broadway actors would always have fur attached to their face and it looked great, more like cats. Also, people loves cats for the costumes and makeup not everything has to be cgi"
"I come here often to cheer myself up, every time I mess things up."
Parents : KIDS LOOK AWAY<br><br>Kids: Why? It says PG<br><br>Parents: ......... because I said so
IF YOU JUST ADD A CAT NOSE IT WOULD BE 80% LESS HORRIFYING!! ITS SO SIMPLE!!!
"Don&#39;t worry guys, there&#39;ll be eight sequels to this movie.<br><br><br>Edit: Nine lives"
"If the cats union saw this movie, they would hate and despise all the humans and start moving away from them in the forests returning to their bigger siblings....<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <br><br>but then returning with all of them... &quot;Sarge, let’s charge on them!!!!!”...."
I thought Universal gave up on the Dark Universe after the Mummy reboot failed
So these actors had to wear full body green suits for this entire movie <br>Imagine how much they much hated themselves for deciding to be in this movie.
"After we raid Area 51, can we please raid Universal Studios."
<b>&quot;This is the worst thing to happen to cats since dogs&quot; - Ricky Gervais</b>
These aren’t the cat girls I was expecting at Area 51
My cat ran away from me after watching this trailer. For some reason
Man... I usually try to reserve judgement until I see all of it but man I don’t have high expectations for this
"Fun fact: i had to sit through this shit with my mom 3 Christmases ago.<br><br><br>And unsurprisingly, we both hated it."
this brings a whole new meaning to the word “furry”
What cat girls in anime look like vs what they actually look like
"This is going to awaken so many furries, jesus Christ"
I don&#39;t have a problem with this. It&#39;s the stage musical that makes me feel uneasy.
I see they finally made a movie about the family of cats from Chernobyl
The government is trying to tell us that celebrities aren&#39;t lizards in fact they are actually cats
I can understand why Thanos wanted to shred the universe to it&#39;s last Atom..
Hey that asteroid that killed the dinosaurs… I’m ready for ours.
James Corden is in every movie that people hated<br><br>1. Emoji Movie<br>2. Cats<br>3. Peter Rabbit<br>4. Trolls<br>5. Small Foot<br><br>Edit: bruh 281 likes howwww
Satan looks under his bed every night to make sure these things are not there.
Dr Phil: So you’re telling me... You went naked with cat fur all over your body in public.
&quot; this is the worst thing to happen to cats since dogs&quot;
"Some of them have fur, But please tell me why some of them look...<br><br><br><br>...SMOOTH."
We gotta stop these people from their crack addictions
I think we all owe Mike Myer&#39;s cat in the hat an apology
This film was cursed from the moment they put James Cordon’s name first in the credits.
"I’ve never felt such a strange combination of pity, and indigestion."
These are not the cat girls that I wanted to find in Area 51
Lets just appreciate the fact that people actually decided to like this video
Manga: lackadaisy comic<br>Anime: lackadiasy cartoon <br>Netflix adaptation:
“CALL THE NAVY!”<br><br>“Meow”<br><br>“THE CATS HAVE TAKEN OVER THE NAVY!”<br><br>“NOT THE NAVY!!!!!”
Suddenly the sonic movie is looking a whole lot better.
It looks like the cat in the hat had a litter with the lion from the wizard of Oz.
This is the &#39;Madame Web&#39; of Broadway musicals adapted to the big screen.
This is literally what Satan checks under his bed for before he goes to sleep... even he can’t handle those abominations lol
Um animal control yeah we gotta problem
They should rename this &quot;Snapchat filter: The movie.&quot;
Wow someone actually said this is a good idea and the production team went along with it
"When even Taylor stans are not liking this, you know you goofed up."
"honestly, <br><br>IF U CLOSE UR EYES<br><br>it sounds good<br><br>but when u open them up,<br><br>💀💀"
"IDRIS MY G U COULD OF BEEN JAMES BOND BOSSMAN, WHY A CAT"
If I only watched the first ten seconds of the trailer and known little else about this movie I would have thought it was a high-budget porno...
The story line seems like it would be good but the cgi.... Umm no

Why the frick does the white cat look like James charles
Are these the failed experiments of Area 51? They have to be!

Our cat is no longer interacting with humans after watching this movie.
"If cats would&#39;ve done a movie called Humans, they would certainly do a better job."
I saw this &quot;movie&quot; on Christmas of 2019 after my partner and I had a bottle of wine and numerous blunts. It was still barely enough. I&#39;ll never forget the audible groan from the audience when Dame Judi Dench looked at the camera at the end of the film for the final number.
"Is everyone ignoring the fact that these cats have human nose, oh jesus I don&#39;t think I will ever recover from this"
i really wanna know a furry’s opinion on this abomination
Me: Mom can we get 2 cats<br>Mom: We have cats at home <br>Cats af home
"I saw this movie in cinema and i never felt so uncomfortable about character&#39;s design, but it was funny"
Why does James cordon have to be a furry in every goddamn movie lol
129k People Were So Scared They Hit the Like Button on Accident
"Imagine this but but the cats actually look like cats, that would be nice lmao"
"When people in the future study zero rate interest phenomens of the 2010s, this will be in every single textbook that covers the topic."
This actually made me uncomfortable watching. Like I feel violated 😖
"also, I wish Jason Derulo&#39;s line will just be him singing &quot;Jason Derulo&quot;"
I wonder how painful it was for Jason derulo not to be able to yell his own name
Dog fans: furry wolves<br>Cat fans: cats movie
"Why don&#39;t they have cat faces. Why don&#39;t they have cat faces. <b>They have human faces on cat bodies, it isn&#39;t correct.</b> <b>I DO NOT LIKE HUMAN FACE ON CAT BODY.</b>"
"<i>Khajiit has wares, if you have coin</i>"
I just  can&#39;t accept that the director of Les Miserables did this.
It went from great musical to a nightmare fuel...
Me : hey I kinda like the movie trailer<br><br>My brother : <b>signs me up for therapy</b>
I don&#39;t think even the Furries wanted anything to do with this.
"Sum of them are wearing fur jackets, like what ? 🤨"
When you wanted anime cat girls but you got this instead:
Wow real life cat-girls<br>-Elon Musk has entered the chat
And we all thought the first sonic trailer was bad
"“This Holliday Season , You will believe” .... that this film lost 90 million dollars."
"I was pretty sad when the Warrior cats movies were always delayed. Now, after I&#39;ve seen this, I think it&#39;s maybe for good."

the trailer scares the shite outta me istg wth it&#39;s like an underlying jumpscare is ready to happen and it keeps me so tense-
Such an amazing cast but with a movie like this- nothing can save It o-o
This will be better if it just a human musical that have a Victorian era settings or aesthetic
"If only cats knew about this atrocity, they would never want to be our pets."
"they went through the long process of this movie getting the actors, making the script, etc etc, AND NO ONE ASKED THE QUESTION: “WTF ARE WE EVEN DOING HERE?!”"
"I remember sitting in the theater for “Christopher Robin”, watching the trailers for new movies coming out, and getting frozen with terror as soon as this one came on"
"If you think about it long enough, this movie is essentially a revival of those medieval European cat paintings. Some weird and uncanny things just couldn&#39;t change even with the ease of modernity we all have now."
"I couldn&#39;t watch the trailer for a nano second before holding my phone at arm&#39;s length, getting off the trailer, and deleting my search and watch history while washing my eyes"
i love this movie and i’m not ashamed
This movie: Exists<br><br><br>The last airbender:  Am I a joke to you?
Still not understand why people hate this movie.
Every single person involved in the production of this movie should be embarrassed.
"The only place I wanted them to take this was to have actually realistic looking animated cats performing the musical as the actual animal would do. I don&#39;t think the creators even knew what cats looked like. They&#39;re giving cats a bad name because cats are cute, they are not cat-human-monkey hybrids"
Why did I search this up I think I am permanentally scarred
My eyes! My eyes! I want to put out my eyes after watching this.
"&quot;This Christmas, you will believe.&quot;<br>Its 2022 and I still don&#39;t"
Is anyone else here after the Chip &#39;n Dale trailer
This is we forget our dreams <br><br>Because this is what is them and we&#39;d lose our sanity if we remember them
This trailer is the perfect definition of &quot;Uncanny Valley&quot;
Happy on 40 anniversary Cats ! :)
"The lesson from this is quite simple, and one that has constantly been forgotten by Hollywood: Use the right medium for your story. Some things just shouldn&#39;t be live action, or cgi, or whatever. I can think of many absolute dud live action movies that would have undoubtedly been spectacular had they been animated. Tank Girl, for instance, imagine if that movie had been done entirely in the style of the short 2D animated bit partway through the movie. Just imagine all of this music coupled with lively traditional animation like the kind america used to know how to do."
"&quot;From Academy Award Winning Director<br>Tom Hooper&quot;<br><br><br><br><br><br>Where&#39;s your Academy Award trophy now, Tom?"
I literally had to watch this movie in a shitty theater with a chair thats so upright that when i slouch to realx myself a bit the chair closes on my face turning me into a sandwhich -_-
"This movie isn&#39;t a movie,its just a music video,such a bruh moment"
Even I disliked this when it came out and I can&#39;t even remember doing that 💀
"After all this years,this trailer still haunts me,please free me from the haunting this trailer gave me"
This will make every furry second guess themselves.
R.I.P. the dislikes.
Some one said on twitter that &quot;this is the worst thing happened to cats after the dogs&quot;😭
This makes the emoji movie look like an oscar winner
Andrew Lloyd Webber will be putting his foot down on Hollywood from attempting to make any more Film Adaptations of his work after Cats was a failure.
I come here to watch this every year just to feel the pain. 🗿
I cringed so hard at this.....<br><br><br><br><br>I now have wrinkles
"r/cursedcomments<br>r/TIHI<br>r/cursedimages <br><br>Reddit, here we come!!!"
This is why covid happened
I forgot this movie existed
"You know what, maybe &quot;Pixels&quot; (2015) isn&#39;t so bad after all."
its like if coffee and nightmares had a baby
The movie was very good. A lot of people worked very<br>hard to make this movie. The untalented small people<br>making negative comments are useless. They produce<br>no art of their own to be reviewed.
Is this what realistic furrys would look like?
Here in 2024 questioning who’s idea it was to fuse humans with cats
This happens when movie companies need to stop putting celebrities in their films to think it&#39;ll come out great. This bombs.
Musicals were way better back in the day.
lmao i cannot stop laughing at this trailer
"Four years after this movie came out, i&#39;m grateful that Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman turned down a role in this movie due to their busy schedules. Two of the most respectable actors working today doesn&#39;t deserve to be in this and i&#39;m so glad they didn&#39;t get the roles for this movie"
This movie was so bad I saw it on a flight and people still walked out
"I saw the Cats Musical in the 1990s, when folks had class and appreciated Art. First view The Cats movie on Netflix. I love the Cats Movie. Now my favorite. ❤"
Budget: $95 mln<br>I have no more questions...
My grandma is actually watching this movie right now...
"not gonna lie... I kinda like this movie. I fully acknowledge that it’s bizarre and that some of the performances (rebel wilson and james corden) are abismal at best, BUT I still find a good amount of enjoyment in this movie. i think some of the music is done pretty well done, like skimbleshanks’ song as well as the intro song. I think a lot of people went into this movie wanting to hate it but that isn’t really fair and doesn’t do justice to the real performers who put a lot of work into it. I also don’t even think the CGI is that bad I think people need to get over themselves lmao"
OK hear me out I think this would have been a lot better as an animation
All the cat killers are rubbing their hands together watching this
This makes me realize The Scorpion King wasn&#39;t so badly animated.
I must be the only one who likes this film 😭😭😭😭
Doja Cat&#39;s face when she&#39;s not invited to the movie: 👁👄👁
"Oscars: Hi, uh, is this tom hooper<br>Tom:Yes<br>Oscars:We would like that golden award we gave you back"
"My cat saw me this watching, and now I don&#39;t have a cat."
Not one litter box in this whole trailer
"Cats r hot as hell and good singing/dancing, i dont get y ppl hate this movie."
Imagine all life in earth goes extinct and aliens need to find proof and this is the only proof
"Music is great, but who the hell decided it would be a good idea to have cats with human faces and proportions"
Who made this and… why…. this traumatises forever😂
Best thing to say about it is that it’s not as bad as Cuties
The trailer made it look so good
Imagine the animators behind Lackadaisy reanimating this entire movie.
This is the worst thing happened to cats after dogs. <br>- Ricky Gervais
Universal Pictures is terrified to present <br>One of the most disappointed motion pictures of the year<br>The winner of six Golden Raspberry Awards<br>Including Worst Picture
I tried watching this on Netflix.<br><br>I got about 10 minutes in and I wondered &quot;Why the hell am I watching this sober?&quot;
Mom...i dont want chase to live with us anymore....
Who would have thought you see Idris Elba as a Cat Falling onto Nelsons column  from above 😀😺😺
I must be insane because I love this movie
I didn&#39;t believe that a whole movie can made with instagram filter.<br>Until I saw this.
Dude when everybody says it’s so bad I feel like its not
Only realised today that this came out the same year as Rise of Skywalker.<br><br>Covid started in 2019 and was somehow only the 3rd worst thing to come out of that year.
this is what 2020 is in 1 video
Cat in the Hat was right his world is scary
This has to be the most disturbing movie of alltime
Happy on 40 anniversary Cats Musical ! :)
I really don&#39;t know how to feel about this-
Congratulations on 40 anniversary Cats Musical ! :)
"Cats was a good movie. It was not the best ever made, but I enjoyed it enough to put it on my favorite movies playlist."

The best part is that this trailer is better than the actual movie
ok is no one gonna comment on the fact that the song in the trailer legit just goes &#39;toooooooooouch meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee&#39;<br>u telling me no one was like &quot;tf did we just make&quot;?????????
"Day 1 after watching this movie: gets instant depression that&#39;s heavier than your mon<br><br>Day 2. I started drinking the living soul out of me<br><br>Day 3. Haven&#39;t slept all night cus of the cocaïne<br><br>Day 4. Went to do groceries,when the guy behind me pushed me, I fell with my wrist on the counter and discovered that I am a pack of oreos<br><br>Day 5. Finally hangs myself"
the singer: TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUCCCCHHHH MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br>Me: wtf
This film reminds me of when I saw a cat with a human face I’ll never forget it I was traumatised lol
It could has been worse: the hardrives might have been stolen and the people who worked on the CGI would have been forced to reanimate the whole thing.
"My cat saw me this watching, Now she don&#39;t wanna be a cat."
An advert to see an advert. Of course Universal is monetising Cats right here!
Hollywood after midnight 😼
"Okay, so my friends told me to read cats book but I just decided to watch the movie instead so I typed this up and saw this...creepy"
I don’t know how to feel about these human cats
Anime cat girls:cute and nice <br><br>Cat girls in real life:
"I don’t know why everyone’s complaining, it’s was very funny and I also cry...<br>Well I was high as fuck so that make sense."
Who tf did they let cook in the studio.
sometimes i ponder HOW much they paid taylor to be in this
I believe life was better before my sister showed me this...
A modern day classic 😊
even though it was pirated still would need a refund
"Seriously, everyone, can we all erase any &amp; all traces of this thing from existence?<br>For the good of humanity?!"
"what is this. i am so  genuinely scared, that i swear when i go to sleep ill see those things in my dreams and when i wake up ill have a heart attack, you wont understand, this is traumatizing."
"When i watch the movie, i felt sleepy. All they do is just sing. 🥱"
Imagine if this was the last relic left of humanity’s existence after an extinction-
Thank God I got an add before the video played
This is so terrifying even Satan is trembling
Yep still has terrifying has the first the day I saw this trailer.
"I came here after hearing Ricky Gervais s comment about this piece of... Art  at the Oscars,     I wish I just took his word for it."
"COVID-19: I fear no man<br><br><b>This movie</b><br><br>COVID-19: But that thing, it scares me"
Cats as humans and realistic…..most people say that’s creepy but….I AGREE!I still want to see it though
COVID 19 was a punishment because THIS!
I gave my cat away after watching this
I really wanna know what ACTUAL cats would think of this
Trailer in 2019 and a year later...<br><br>Coincidence?
Half of the budget was spent on crack for the animators
I must be the only one who’s okay with this. I think everything’s fine. Nothing to get offended by.
4 years since this released.
This trailer Gives me an itch on my leg only a 22-gauge rifle can get rid of
“The worst thing that happened to cats... since dogs”
Welp the furrys are gonna love this 😃
I think why people get upset about the film is that artistry of the film is misunderstood. It is  a digital adaptation of a broadway hit. Its not suppose to be like a regular animated film. Its an 80&#39;s broadway classic for the big screen.
That&#39;s enough internet for the week. Think i may fast for a few days as well.<br><br>What type of sickness causes a fever so irrationally high in temperature that it begins to slowly kill brain cells? The writers/producers/actors may need to be checked.
Youtube rewind 2020:

I loved the part where Lion-O shows up at the end. Thundercats!
NGL this was a GOOD movie<br><br><br><br>said <b>no one</b> ever

If the corona virus watched this it will die
This movie was so bad that the composer had to take a therapy dog because he was traumatized 😭
maybe the old sonic design wasn’t so bad😭😭
I’m literally just here for the comments
i honestly just wanna know how the actors were thinking while making this movie.
they took the word “furry” to another level
How the fuck could they not see that is was a bad idea is beyond understanding.
To think someone had to watch this and approve it
How much did they have to pay Taylor Swift?
how is this not classified as a horror movie
"I just put the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE Official TVC: For the fans song in the trailer<br><br><br><br><br><br>not gonna lie, it made it less boring"
I remember seeing this film and I was like&quot; this is gotta be the weirdest movie I have ever seen&quot;
I showed this to my niece and she tried to send her cat to the pound. Especially James cordons character I had to explain people think he is talented too.
"Alright, time to wash my eyes with some good ol&#39; nekomimi hentai :&#39;)"
They lucky YouTube took down the dislikes lmao
"As a cat lover, I feel somehow insulted."
"There was not a good way of doing this right, even with the amazing cast and good intentions behind."
If i ever wanted to shave i would watch this trailer so i wont regret it.
"Guys, do yourself a favor, and watch this while being drunk, its fucking hilarious"
The unofficial prequel to The Cat In The Hat
"Reminder that this movie so bad, God sent a plague a year later."
"Okay, who was the madman that thought this would be a good idea?"
Happy on 40 anniversary Musical ! :)
Saw cats on Broadway.   What&#39;s wrong with the film?! The dancers are amazing. Only saw the trailer. What am I missing?! 😢
"To this day, I still can’t figure out WHY they thought there was nothing wrong with the CGI."
This is what was happening inside Super Hans New Year&#39;s eve party 😂
They said this was the worst thing to ever happen to Cats since Dogs
Imma tell my kids this was live-action enchantimals
Wow. Terrible movie aside…Jennifer Hudson singing this song gives me the chills. She is so amazing
"If I were a person knowing nothing about cats and accidentally watched this, I would be traumatized to see cats for the rest of my life"
I think the only good thing to come out of this movie is the trailer music 😂
I love cats I&#39;ve got 16 of them. But this movie scares me.
Viewed The Cats Movie twice on Netflix and will view many more times. ❤
Pre-COVID this came out.
What the hell this looks like it came from a slave given Microsoft Paint and the slave was supposed to make a masterpiece.
"See these eyes of green<br>I can stare for a thousand years<br>Colder than the moon<br>It&#39;s been so long<br>Feel my blood enraged<br>It&#39;s just the fear of loosing you<br>Don&#39;t you know my name?<br>Well, you&#39;ve been so long<br>And I&#39;ve been putting out fire....."
"Oh god, where&#39;s Batman when you need him?!"
I lost half of my sanity after watching the entire trailer.
Cant wait for the dogs to come out
Normal people with cat ears would be fine for us
Cats showing in HBO is going to be the only horror movie you will need to watch this year
Everything started going downhill after this film came out.
I can’t believe that Taylor swift was in this and James cordon and Jason derulo
Love how there are more dislikes than likes
How to have nightmare for the rest of your life in 2 minutes and 24 seconds!
this is why I can&#39;t go to sleep at night
All this cast and they decided to make a movie about &quot;CATS&quot;

It&#39;s the the cgi that&#39;s bad.<br><br>It&#39;s the design.
"Apparently, they lost $150 million with this one"
"That ain&#39;t a box office, thats a square inoperability"
This trailer alone was scarier than any horror movie I’ve ever seen.
Better than The Emoji Movie
I&#39;m surprised they haven&#39;t turned off the comment section 😂
Wtf how did I get here
"I used to think this trailer was a tragedy, but now I realize it&#39;s a comedy."
im traumatized now
"if they played this movie on an airplane, people would still walk out on it"
Editors: I ain&#39;t bothered to make this look nice
would this have worked in a disney and life of pets style where the cats are just literal animated cute cats and not reminiscent of furry porn?
"Ok Can people please stop being rude because I enjoyed this movie, I&#39;m allowed to have an opinion, its really disrespectful if you are mean treat everyone with respect!!!"
Shown in Theaters with:<br>The Lion King <br>Overcomer <br>Downton Abbey <br>Abominable <br>Last Christmas
"ThIs cHrIsTMAs , YoU wILL BElIevE."
Came here to see a glimpse of how they lost Sven ...<br><br><br><br><br>...Sventy million dollars 💸
"All I&#39;m going to say is we are in the very last minute of the end of days we are the last generation that God spoke about in the Bible and according to the Bible a generation is only 70 to 80 years and from what the Bible says this generation began when Israel became a nation in one day in the year of 1948 so you add that up and there&#39;s going to be 7 years of tribulation before Jesus Christ returns... lift up your heads and look because your Redemption draweth near, Jesus Christ is coming!!!"
Life went downhill since Cats came out.<br>Coincidence? <br>Doubt it
"When weebs say they want nekomimi human hybrid, they don&#39;t mean this, but this is an example of be careful what you wish for."
I can&#39;t sleep now I know this exist
This traumatized me seeing this when I was a kid
I&#39;m going to congratulate every blind person on this planet for not having the ability to see this
"After seeing the designs for almost 2 hours straight, im pretty sure im developing mental problems."
"When the preview started to open, I low-key thought it was a horror movie💀💀"
So.. looking at the coments and dislikes... what is this movie about? ... Some cats turning into anthopomorphic creatures to sing and dance? I never heard of it until today.
My cat just died after watching this movie
"You&#39;ve heard the expression &#39;a night on the tiles&#39;, have you not? Well, that is probably the key missing ingredient from this move that might have got more bums on seats."
The trailer came out on my birthday
im sorry but who thought this was a good idea for a movie?
Did they really have to use human cats instead of anthropomorphic cats
to everyone hating on cats:<br><br><br>what is so wrong with this movie because i havent seen it.
The day humanity fell into chaos
I just finished watching this movie for the 3rd time<br>What the hell am I doing<br>And why do I watch the credits with a grin on my face every time
Film was so bad god done sent a plague a Month later 😭
What&#39;s wrong? I thought you all wanted catgirls.
This movie gave me covid
lets forget this ever happened
I don’t understand why everyone was freaking out they’re not actually scary a little uncanny but seriously it’s just like a weird live action Disney movie
The Movie &quot;CATS&quot; is Amazing Beyond Belief. ❤ ❤ ❤
"like dont lie the soundtrack is amazing but sis, a movie..."
I bet half of the budget was for the crack
I bet Andrew was furious 😂
Just imagine this could’ve have been a great movie with the cast but they made........this
"We will remember this not only it’s bad, because it has haunted our souls"
they had to spend half the movie budget on crack for the actors
A review said :This is the worst thing that happened to cats since dogs
this movie cursed the entire year
I wonder why does this have more dislikes then likes
I really thought Jesus was gonna come back after this movie released
I think we all know...<br>You came here to dislike the video
Shining example of how the Uncanny Valley can break a movie!
MY EYES! MY EYES!
The money spent to make this monstruosity surpasses the GDP of Paraguay. I feel there is something terribly wrong here.
This year is the 40th anniversary of the musical this......thing is based on.
the world has been getting progressively worse at an accelerated pace since
It deserves Ricky Javer&#39;s roast.😂😂😂
&quot;motion capture put me in a bad light&quot;
i was happiest man before i knew this existed
The best way to wash his trailer and this movie is drunk because you don&#39;t focus on the bad CGI
Jason Derulo said that he wants to want Himself for the film
This movie wasn&#39;t supposed to be made
The only way the film of Cats would have not ended up as a total war crime is if Hollywood had given Studio Ghibli a big bag of money and final cut
I searched “horror” and this came up!!
Ngl still up at 1am laughing at how bad this movie is 2.8 on IMDb is as worst as it gets
"Apart that a theatre event musical without a story does not translate to silvercreen, these werecats are ghastly. <br><br>They should have gone full cgi and do the faces too. <br><br>But showing that african american skin was a Must. Inclusion is box office poison."
"Imagine going to the horror movie like &quot;Us&quot;, but it ends up being mildly scary at best cause some cats trailer before the movie is more of a nightmare fuel than any shit afterwards..."
What expect to be difference between this terrific CGI and the TeenZ (Dark unicorn Vs Rainbow unicorn)?
Why is this version Jennifer Hudson but the official released version isnt and there isnt any version with just jennifer hudson and no dialogue?
Hey should we make these look like cats or humans?<br><br><br><br><br>Yes
What’s next? Live action Shrek?
Fun fact there are two shot to the groin jokes in this movie…….
this project feels like in half progress they just realized that this was a dogshit idea but to lazy for a turn back
<b>This movie is just a fever dream with furries</b>
Imagine knowing the dislikes on this Video?<br>Ahhh Good times.
I still CANNOT believe this was a movie
The most horrifying horror movie I&#39;ve ever seen.
"Movie is what it is, about a bunch of dead cats competing for reincarnation. So they get new life. Egyptian religion based, hence the bar they frequent. With splash of Catholics added in. Cats are thought to live in both worlds of living and the dead simultaneously."
More terrifying than <i>Felidae.</i>
Why didn&#39;t they just make this with NORMAL CGI cats?
And you thought catwoman was a bad movie.
When this trailer dropped nearly 3 years ago that was a true cultural reset. We all together were absolutely horrified of this absolute disaster.
Anakin Skywalker &quot;no&quot;<br><br>Yoda &quot;do or do not there is no try&quot;
"ah, yes.<br><br>nightmare fuel"
"The whole comment section : &quot;terrible movie&quot; , dissing the producer blah blah.<br>Me : who jus can to see Taylor and other talented actors...👁️👄👁️🤧🤧😩👀📈📈🤯🤯🤯😐😐😐🤒🌚🌚🌚🌚 bye. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank u Next!"
2020 is our punishment for this movie.
One of the very few videos that has more dislikes than likes
I watched this movie on meth and it was the best thing ever
How the hell did they get taylor swift or even Idris Elba to star in this movie or Heck how did this get past the animation team like it went through so many people including the director and not even ONE of them thought &quot;Yeah this is a bad idea&quot;
I am here because of birthmoviesdeath article about Rob Sheridan going to see this movie on shrooms. What the hell did i just watch?
Still have yet to see it any good? 😁😬
"If i swith the number in the dislike rational, i can assume everyone liked it (yes ik you dont like the &quot;cats&quot; movie, its just my brain)"
"My mom bringed me to watch this 3 years ago, and im sitting there confused glad it&#39;s over! Longest 2 hours of my life watching this film.."
Jason A. Lol😂
Wait this movies real and I didn’t trip into a bag of cocaine
This is if Gacha people with cat ears were real
This movie disturbing and horrifying
Ever since this movie came out things went to shit for the rest of the world. That is not a coincidence
It&#39;s the worst thing that happened to cats since dog.
"I thought i would never to urged, to blow my self in the head with a 9m 💀"
Remember if it has james gordon it ain&#39;t good
I can’t even think of an insult to give this movie because I have so many ways to make fun of it
"Genie: “You have three wishes.”<br>Person: “I wish this movie never existed.”<br>Genie: “You still have three wishes, that wish is on me.”"
Yay! I got a bob ross ad!
Wow so much hate...I actually quite enjoyed this movie but it&#39;s not the first time I have loved what everyone else hates...
(Two years later)<br><br>IN THE HEIGHTS saved us
"I&#39;m gonna be honest... I love cats.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Not the movie, the movie fucking sucked, but the animals based after the movie are really great."
Why was this popular as a play???
I imagine this might actually be a personal hell for some.
Why did I rewatch this?
LISTEN TO THE HATERS  💪💪💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥‼‼‼‼💯💯
Its just humans wearing cat costume for Halloween
How the the fuck is there more 139k likes!?
this is more terrifying than most horror movies
You have to think twice about releasing it man
i made a new account as it logged me out and after this being the first video i watched it recommended me horror movies right after
Cats VS Food fight VS The Emoji Movie. Would you buy tickets?
"I have to assume the movie sucked as badly as the trailer. Clearly, Cats was a dog. <br>This is a great way to keep people out of the theaters."
"Is this the greatest fear of Luz Noceda from the Owl House, besides telling her mother?"
POV: you came here for the comments
Yay! Elon musk is making catgirls!<br>Catgirls:
but im happy theyre enjoying shooting this movie
This is what I&#39;m thinkng when I have fever
I thought would be watching a trailer of movie about cats but wtf is thus
This is a furry convention&#39;s dream
I honestly forgot this movie even existed
Francesca Hayward is one hott little kitty.  ... meow!!
"Don&#39;t worry, I only came to see Taylor Swift in the trailer"
I mean they should just call this Scary Movie 6
Everyday we stray further from god
"Well, there goes the plan to watch this movie"
140k likes! I bet this movie was loved by many
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U&amp;t=87"">1:27</a> Oscarbait so much....!!!!!!!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣<br>They really try soooo HARD to win that shitty oscar XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD"
"Jason Derulo, T Swift and Gandalf in the same film... ???"
This is why we can&#39;t have nice things
This is the worst thing to happen to cats since dogs
Im questioning my existence
"ME before watching: No movie can be shit, all movies have something good about &#39;em!<br>Also me: ....................................................****!"
I’m genuinely terrified
Universal took furry&#39;s to a whole new level.
I think most people came here to find out how this is...
I REALLY LOVE ALL THE SONGS IN THIS MOVIE!!
"Whats next Bunnies YAS they should hop around the whole thing I would be so grateful, (Prays)"
Dam man I shouldn&#39;t have watched this late in the night now am scared someone hug me
I’m scared
Did they actually think it was a good idea?
Is this for childs right?
Maybe this was the reason for 2020 everything in?
I know if  people hate musical movies and cats uncanny Valley design but that&#39;s ok
The effort they made is clearly visible but the results are truly terrible ⭐️
Maybe Nekopara wasnt that bad.
That certainly would of made me die in a bad trip if I was on acid
Damn you Andrew Lloyd Webber for starting us down this road!
this should have been an animated movie
What’s wrong with humanity these days?
This is an absolute monstrosity how did 140k people like this
I called this movie the &quot;Meow Mix&quot; movie!!!🐱🐾
Cats is buffet for Melmac
i would rather gouge out my eyes tham watch this
Should be rated 18+
"the composition of the trailer is actually very well done. It&#39;s a wonderfully cut trailer...it&#39;s just the the visuals are from a horror movie. Like if I couldn&#39;t see the visuals, i would have a very different opinion of this.<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23releasethebuttholecut"">#releasethebuttholecut</a> 😹😹😹😹😹😹"
it hurts.... IT HURTTSSSS
Who just looked at this movie and was like “yep this is perfect 🤩”
This is truly terrifying
this is 2 whole mins of try not to cringe challenge guys
Not the cats and human hybrids 😭
Reminder that Cats: the movie was the last major film released before the word went to shit<br><br><br><br>Coincidence? Maybe...<br><br>Maybe not...
I watch this daily
I&#39;m still wondering how those cats in that movie mate.
Why do people hate this so much? I know nothing about cats
"It sucks that this got a lot of hate  cause the play cats is really good, just wish they wouldve changed the design so it didnt have the terrible cgi"
LOL
Catgirls we wanted VS catpeople we get: <br><br>😑
so this is what started the coronavirus
The cast are all illuminati allstars
"And they wonder why it flopped. <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/RPkfY8TPGsCakNAP-JWAoAQ""></a>"
lmao what an insult to literal cats.
this is what people think furries are like
is it weird that i acctually like this movie?
What&#39;s wrong with the trailer? Why so many dislikes? There are multiple genres and their fans. But what&#39;s wrong with it?
Did this originate from those old PSAs?
oh god im only just now watching this for the first time and they made them <b>small</b><br>if your gonna make them people cats make them people sized
This movie must be in darkweb
I wanted to see this movie
this was one of the worst experiences of my life. just what in the absolute fuck were they thinking
they shouldn&#39;t add taylor swift into this.
Ah. Spoiled milk
Come on Hollywood 😔
I completely forgot this movie existed.... I&#39;m glad I never watched it.
This would be a useful tool in interrogation
I can’t even tell what this is about
Holy s*** what am I sering
"ขอให้ &quot;องค์พระสัมมาสัมพุทธเจ้า&quot; ทรงช่วยคุ้มครอง<br>น้องของขวัญให้ปลอดภัยแคล้วคลาดด้วยครับ<br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%B8"">#สาธุสาธุสาธุ</a>"
This is what weebs get when they ask for a cat girl.
what is this lmao
"Si no fuera porque amo el musical original y me encanta el teatro, danza, cinematografía y todo eso no hubiese visto la película con ese trailer"
I remember watching this in theatre I literally waited in the bathroom for 20 minutes cause how shit it was
I&#39;m pretty sure everything going wrong since 2020 is because us humans made this unholy movie.
128 bit cats be like
Ngl I went to the cinema on opening night to see this &amp; I absolutely loved it 💗 Still do 😻😻😻
Is it bad?
They could have made realistic CGI cats...
<i>Wow vr has gotten to real</i>
"I can tell the cast was trying their best. If you wanted better, fix the characters of JennyAnyDots and Bustopher Jones, and use practical costumes instead of CGI fur, make the mice and cockroaches puppets/toys, and make Idris Elba’s Macavitymore villainous instead of making him bumbling at times. Is it that hard Hooper?"
Welcome to Kittylandia or Catslandia.
"I may be the only person on this planet who actually ENJOYED this movie. lol Indeed, I will even go so far as to say that this version of Cats is BETTER than The Lion King (live action one) Garfield, The Cat in the Hat, Catwoman and Cats and Dogs. And its FAR better (at least singing-wise) than Les Miserables or Phantom of the Opera (the one with Gerard Butler as the Phantom)."
Whoever got this idea should be put in mental asylum
IM SO CREPED OUT EWW WAIT WHAT
"Ok. I need to know. Am I the only one who thinks sexy cat Taylor Swift is actually... sexy? Please, someone, agree with me!"
"IN THE NAME OF THE GOD EMPEROR, I DECLARE EXTERMINATUS"
Still a better movie than Crocodile Dundee
Better than the Kings Speech
So im the only one who came cuase of pinguinz?
Well this is gonna haunt my dreams
This makes Morgz look good
"Why make what is essentially a  film of a stage production, instead of just actually filming a stage production? Almost every scene in this film looks like it could have been shot in a theatre. Oddly, I think a photorealistic animated version (a bit like The Polar Express) might have worked better."
MAGNIFICIENT!
"They should’ve made it an animated movie, Puss in Boots style. Or just use real cats."
Uhmm ok. Honestly was expecting worse after reading the comments before watching i guess that secret to avoiding the cringe. My question is ehy did idris alba sign up for this like bro come on😂
Still better than megamid 2 👍
I think im having nightmares tonight
"Whoever thought this was a good idea, uhh............"
"I have a few questions: why? why? why? and, why? just why?"
This movie was so good what you guys sayin
"&quot;I have a question, for god WHYYYYYYYY&quot;"
What&#39;s up jerks!!
"August,2024 Here for Taylor !"
2019 was quite a year for live action😅
"Mike Myers thought this looked stupid.  Yes, really."
"This is torture to watch, I was terrified."
This movie was great! If you can look pass the humanoid cats.
Congratulations on 40 anniversary Cats ! :)
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U&amp;t=94"">1:34</a> oh how the mighty have fallen"
I would have watched this had they shown them cleaning themselves.
They should do a Cats animation movie. This was awlful
What the ...<br><br>- Garfield
"I get this whole thing is like four years old, but I wanted to watch this movie on my birthday last year and got mad when I couldn’t because it wasn’t on anything and I left 1998’s CD at my dad’s…"
Can anyone explain y they cast judy dench as old deuteronomy ?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U&amp;t=53"">0:53</a> What&#39;s wrong with it?"
I bet everyone who wrote and produced this movie was high off of LSD or some type of drugs. Who idea was this on the first place? 🤣💩
Thats why dogs are better
Lol again in 2024!
evanescence bring me to life
Never knew Shane Dawson directed a movie
I dont get it
i don&#39;t know why everybody&#39;s hating on this. i love it... genius!
BEST MOVIES OF 2010s<br>ENDGAME<br>JOHN WICK 3<br>TERMINATOR 6<br>WORST ONES IN 2010s<br>CATS <br>DORA MOVIE<br><br><br>THE DORA MOVIE IS EVEN WORSE
Uh the comment are not turned of<br>Floppy?<br>Lost 72 million dollars 😄🤣
Furries wet dream be like
"Do you ever wonder, what is going in their head?"
I gave up seeing this movie because of the comments
This film created covid when it was released in China
nightmare fuel :)
I liked it
I think this trailer is kinda banging;
Furry&#39;s wet dream:
Who allowed something like this to exist??<br><br>Edit: I am gonna have to file a complaint to god about this.
They should make a horror game based arround this<br><br>It would be a sucess
In Cats (2019)
the movie was like 99% of them are singing and 1% of them are speaking BORINGG
I see why people hate this
I see why people hate this
"What has to be wrong with your brain to think that making a movie like this is a good idea, and after seeing the god awful final product you still decide to release it???"
The cast was one of the best cast ever but the movie was one of the worst movie ever lol
I laughed when I saw this
In December 20
They look goofy asf😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂
"the movie is horrifying , They are even scared"
God has abandoned us.
Satan is that you drag me down with you into the abyss
not even taylor could fix this
... I&#39;m scarred for life
why tf do everyone call this movie a horror movie???
I would’ve died not knowing what doomed us all this god is gonna make us answer for this 😮
"Hating on this film is so NPC, like, why can&#39;t people have their own opinion instead of repeating what other idiots say"
I brought 2 DVDs at Walmart ✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️
"Can someone pls explain me why this trailer got a huge number of dislikes, is the movie bad?? Coz I haven&#39;t watch it yet"
I like it... But I Dont Know Why This Movie Is Get Hated...
Why hasn&#39;t this been removed yet ?
wow good film :..........)
The comments are hilarous...
this is slander to all the actors names
Do you guys know what stairs scene people are so creeped out about?? I’m literally not seeing it and a timestamp would be helpful.
"This was on,y 5 years ago? What!?"
Jennifer&#39;s voice😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩
This film is coronavirus vaccine
What am I doing back here
Just literally put a cat infront of the camera and usr cgi&#39;s with human forms is more weirder to audiences
I mean first time I saw this specific trailer I’m like what is this crap? Then Jen Hudson started singing I’m like whoah that sounds good and epic. Nahh it’s still bad lol
I think the CGI would’ve been better if it was actual animation instead of this. This CGI would be better for movies like ThunderCats not this beautiful musical that they had to butcher.
it is like watching worst nightmare....
I only came here for the roast comments
Can you guys explain why you guys hate this film?
My pole dance song 🐱😻
I can&#39;t do this to myself
Here after red notice?
I’ve seen toilet flushs that are more interesting than this movie😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫
Hi
Please never cook again
Just watched the movie.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Is this Disney&#39;s dark side?
This is scary
Am selling my cat
The Emoji Movie is looking better already. 😒
"Even Cats, No! Especially Cats! Would HATE this movie!"
Lovely
Help me I’m dying helppp
Who thought this was a good idea tho
Honestly I wonder how the actors felt when they saw the shitty reviews...
i rather watch the adventure of tintin that this creepy movie (the adventures of tintin visual effects are way better than this creepy movie)
I really didnt think it was so awfull haha people need to chill
"Idk why and I feel quilty, but I enjoyed the movie somehow, it was so bad, that it was good"
This may be the best movie for furries
Not enough teats. Real cats have teats
so basically &quot;furries: the movie&quot;
Para esto se presto taylor swift
This feels like Furry&#39;s Frankenstein
I haven’t watched this movie because I know I’d love it.
The cat equivalent of cancer
I feel like my ears and eyes are being raped by this movie
Who&#39;s idea was to make this  wtf?
WHO THINKS THE CATS ARE TERRIFYING
The emoji movie : finally a worthy opponent. Our battle will be legendary
Imagine if it was dogs😮
Watching cats right now on spectrum great broadway movie characters I really like this movie🍿🍿🍿🍿
I’m scared
Can’t even finish the trailer
Would it actually worked if they used cgi cats instead?
Chad kultchin brought me here now I have more questions? Wth is wrong with that man ?
Chad kultchin brought me here now I have more questions? Wth is wrong with that man ?
oh my eyes my eyes
Jennifer Hudson BUTCHERED what should have been the crown song of this play.
literally why
I loved the movie
is this real?
annaRichard love you
Wenn ich rumhacke... Das kann ganz schön fies werden aber gemein bin ich nicht... Man darf zurückmobben... Ne...
I take it most of the people who commented in the past have never seen or heard the original musical CATS by Andrew Lloyd Webber? Most of you have been overly judgmental to those who like it.. who cares if they like something diff than you? World would be a boring place if we all liked the same thing. Anyway I also take it you missed the core of the story which is basically being accepting of others for their appearance and differences in general. 🤦🏻‍♀️ seriously not sure how I missed that this came out in movie form though. I may not watch it as I prefer it on stage. The art form and dance is beautiful though.
A version with real cats would  of been better
"From now on, we just call it the C-word. The original title of this movie is offensive"
Yes the movie sucked. But the trailer actually looked great. I had no clue why y’all were fussing.
What the heck it’s that? Are those hecking cats? Hey stop showing me these those are weird cats.
"I just found out this happened oh my god and they lost ~ $114,000,000 usd ahhhhhhhhhhhh that&#39;s hilarious"
Congratulations on 40 anniversary Musical ! :)
what am i watching
The character design is so bad it even made Big Brother gag.
Can we just go back to tomes when we&#39;re just making fun of this movie? 😭 Life was simpler then.
Humans are so wierd
It&#39;s what really started the pandemic.
This just proves not everyone can sing broadway style. Taylor S and J Hudson butchered those songs
I saw the stage play in Nevada and New Mexico which I loved. Seeing the movie helped explain the stage play a lot more.  I personally like the movie quite a bit and really couldn&#39;t understand why others didn&#39;t.  I am not and never have been a huge musical fan but I do love CATS.
This is. What furrys dream about
"I actually love this movie. Unironically.<br><br>Tom Hooper&#39;s filmmaking career before this has been honestly fishing for Oscars as far as I&#39;m concerned. &quot;I made a movie about Royalty that humanizes them in a pre-WW2 setting!&quot; OSCAR! &quot;I made a movie of Les Miserables that takes all the emotion out of the music!&quot; OSCAR! This is the funhouse mirror version of those movies. It failed SO BADLY at being an Oscar bait movie that people are STILL commenting on it nearly half a decade later.<br><br>That said...I remember far more about this movie than The King&#39;s Speech or Les Miserables (the latter being an adaption of one of my favourite musicals - I&#39;ve never seen the OG Cats). It not only didn&#39;t bore me but it feels like David Lynch&#39;s Rabbits in that its a family sitcom thats not funny but also demands your attention in a way that you NEED to see it."
"You know the people who don&#39;t like this movie,most of them are just Weebs"
This film is what ruined 2020
supporters of the films are hella sus
This is an insult to CATs
And I thought furries were bad...
Aight ama go bleach my eyes anyone wants some to?
That was awesome!
Who here for taylor
I don’t want a cat any more..
<b>laughs</b>
And nothing of value was lost.<br>(Aside from an animation studio)
"Sometimes they continue to realse bad films due to the money they invested in it, they better make profit and  worst response than a loss at all"
I loved the movie! 10/10
movie was so bad that god sent a plague down a month later
All they needed was cat ears and they could’ve had the same shit result
There face are actually not a cat right
omg taylorrrrrrr
who let them cook bruh
I literally thought I was the only one that hated this movie XD
More dislikes than likes 😂
They look like they didnt try at all and just used snapchat filter
What song is this<br>Its kool
Is the movie rly that bad...?
"The world was bad enough, but it started going to absolute fucking shit when this travesty was released"
dangg alot of people dislike it xD<br>i thought they liked iit but yeah i wont do both
"AS A CAT LOVERS, WHAT THE F IS THIS OMG"
Like literally! 99% of the movie is just singing and dancing! And the last 1% is just your average movie!! LITERALLY  The beginning is cringe
Where is the dislike button?
Wait i just realized this was released on my bday 🌝
"Except for the pc animation, I think the actors were great performers, especially J. HUD. The story? Thats it, why should haven t they change?"
"Wait, this isn’t anime cat girl hentai 3D version"
Nice
How furries think they are:
My eyes hurt
my eyes
Keep in mind this is a furry movie
"lets be real ya&#39;ll, the only reason why this trailer has so many views is because everyone wanted to see how dogshit this entire thing will be; also to roast the shit out of it."
I’m glad that we can all agree that this movie is bad.
something fishy about the whole thing.
As a mask this is makes me wanting to be broken
I could probably make a better trailer on IMovie in like two days
No
@UniversalPictures. Dis U?

Better than cuties

On second thought this movie is good after seeing the trailer for cuties which I hate
Taylor swift is in this movie
"not only was this the worst movie created, it also hurts the great actors reputations, and honestly ruins a once great play."
Is this satire ?

"3 lines, the trailer and idea are both dumb."
"The movie is musical / fantasy not horror <br>Most people on this comment section have out this world views about this spectacular movie,, ,, this ain&#39;t horror it&#39;s actually a very fun and entertaining movie and simply another masterpiece and I really love that Taylor Swift is part of this movie ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"

wtf is this
"You know what else sucked? The musical. The costumes were tacky and cheap looking, Grizabella&#39;s costume looked like a bunch of roadkill stitched together. Rum Tum Tugger looked like Frankenfurter turned into a cat. They all wore wrist and ankle warmers to make piss poor looking paws, and had immobile ears and tails. If you wanna talk about freaky looking, do ya&#39;ll remember the rumpus cat with the glowing eyes and leotard leaving <b>nothing</b> to the imagination? If you don&#39;t, here&#39;s a reminder <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYfLuoyxfMA"">https://youtu.be/QYfLuoyxfMA</a>  They had one crappy junkyard set to work with. There was no linear storyline and hardly a plot to speak of because it was just a bunch of people in bad cat costumes dancing around. However it got itself to 4th longest running Broadway musical of all time is a mystery because by all rights it should have crashed and burned just as hard as the movie because they&#39;re the same damn thing."
Goddamn Furry Pandemic of the 2000&#39;s
Yeah...mabye the sonic design wasn&#39;t so abd

Based 🗿
Average YouTube apology video:
"As a former wr holder, I can confirm, this is a crazy time"
Why are your hands covered in fecal mater
Trump  could not spell  the word ELOQENT and would not know what it means. I am Danish speaks 4 foreign languages learning the fifth in Florida we need to learn Espanol
The only one who is mentally impeared and digusting and shameless is this psychopath trump
"Man, what a psychopath. There is something evil about him."
You people are straight lying Donald Trump cares about America and only America he don't care about any other country
The fly is hanging around him cuz of the stench from his soiled Depend diaper no doubt about that.
"This jerk can’t even say her name correctly so who is dumb, stupid and illiterate."
The darkness of his rhetoric is the state of his mind:  MADNESS; a very dark place where he hides now from the truth.  He’s going down and can not accept his failures. God help his followers who are right there with him.
"If only white men were allowed to vote, his remarks may win this for him. Fortunately, those days are over. I’ve mailed my ballot. Vote BLUE!"
"Trump tends to project his feelings about himself onto others. That’s what everyone is missing, when they talk about how great Trump is."
"Listening to Trump kills brain cells.  Obviously, listening to himself has caused total shutdown of his brain!  He sounds old, tired, full of lies, badly misinformed, and backed by 'a few hangers-on left over frim January 6th!'  He states that so many can't speak English; has he listened to himself lately.  Talk about a failure!"
"ah yes i see the liberal media is still going with the ""trump is racist"" even though he never said anything racist in this entire video. the people in these comments agreeing with this video are the same people who support communism socialism and abolishing the constitution so it is really no surprise that trumps scares them."
The problem is the justice system let's him say what he wants and judges want do anything about it we all gonna die if he gets in because he is sick racist enough to start a nuclear war
He is just so sickening to look at and listen to. Donald Trump is the dumbest president ever.
Why is it that cities that have majority minorities are accused of cheating. He is such a racist.
Typical bias and bigoted comments from nbc and it’s sheeple audience!..
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao-Dsq5OJTA&t=253"">4:13</a> <b>so ""NOBODY"" in Springfield Ohio can speak English now, eh??</b>"
"🤔Trump keeps reflecting on himself, he likes to talk about himself, we guess. 🙄"
Where is the racist part?
"Trump is disgusting and I don't understand how people listen to him. Man, why can't people see how corrupt he is. He is using peoples fears to  promote hatred and propaganda. He stoops so low its is like looking like a scary clown. Demeaning Kamala and also people who have mental disabilities is so disgusting. Kamala does not need to react to Trump he is digging his own grave with his stupidity and arrogance. I am a Christian and I can't stand how Trump is manipulating and using gullible Christians. Trumps threat for one hour of violence is enough for him to be removed as a candidate and not only that he lied so much about voter fraud that he should not be allowed to run as a candidate."
I hope nbc is over when trump wins this election
Didn't Conald say he was going to build a wall and let Mexico pay for it? Never happened
Donald Trump is the LESSER evil the left side is way worst. So Trump got my vote 2024.
i just saw a rally where he says Everything Kamala touches turns to Sh...t.....and I dont mean to use that word but it is fitting isn't it?
philadelphia seriously one of thee worsts places in the usa and it's suppose to be important
The only moments his  fans give him applause is when he talk bad about others. Because thats the only thing he can and only thing they understand.
"and here we go again, Trump priming his cabal for election result denial because he knows it's over for him..."
Can you prosecute yourself?
The orange 7urd is completely out of his deranged mind abd btw a fly always find its way to the  💩
SO   tired  of  Despicable  DJT 👎‼️
Trump 2024. Those cheating in elections will be prosecuted. I love to hear that. Democrats are panicking
I didn't hear one thing he said that was racist. You're trying a little bit too hard to save your Democrat bosses. He pretty much had every nail on the head
You ever seen Mark for Death movie.if Harris wins I'm mark for death..vote trump
Hes finished. Coward wont even debate on the network he agreed to. Got fact checked and got caught in numerous lies. What a pathetic orange globster
is he sane<br>who is impaired<br>what a sad state of usa
"Trump’s supporters are very unserious people who obviously wants some sort of comedy in a president of the U.S.  God will be Trump’s vote tabulator, because he will lose, and will be held accountable for his crimes.  I pray Trump will live to face each and every indictment in the court system."
"Come on America you are allowing a racist to spew division, racism, Hate and inciting violence he should be in Jail!!! He is a cesspit of bile..."
Con 45 is a crazy POS...soooo glad when he's gone....what a nightmare this man has been for America.

LIARS LIARS LIARS EVIL INIQUITY WORKING LIARS
Trump is the man !!!!@ media IA a disgrace kamala needs t be the president of a dog pound hahahahs
"The only hope to save the United States from crime, lawlessness and anarchy is Mr Trump."
Clearly mentioned cities with 90% black population
The only person that is mentally impaired is DONALD TRUMP
Please vote 🇺🇸 … from a concerned Australian
The day Biden took office.  Unbelievable. The millions that Biden-Harris let invade our borders illegally need Healthcare too. We didn't have the support in place. Just like we are not ready for 100% EV. You can't get in to see a Dr. for months and longer now. Consequences are too high. They need to be prosecuted.
Trump 2024 ❤
"When Harris wins I hope you get arrested for cheating  and prosecuted ,your words Trump"
orange buffoon should tell Kamala Harris husband that. I bet he doesnt have the guts to do that
You just know everyone in that crowd says the R word.
Is this the Black Entertainment Network?
"2014 Cambridge Analytica scandal- Steve Bannon got your Facebook algorithm and created a database of all Americans 2016 they had been altering feeds to push people who were susceptible to alt-right fascist. They all had to pay fees. 2024 Zuckerberg says he was pressured to censor 2024/2025 Meta has a class action lawsuit before pro alt-right Supreme Court. Republicans block border bill they co wrote bc they are trying to force executive overreach to create a dictatorship. It was intentionally done, the representatives shirked their duty. White population is approximately 58 percent. Most are past reproductive age. High death rate caused by white suicide by gun. Low birth rate currently .8. This is a hail mary attempt."
trump2024
Trump 2024
So sick of Trump. He’s disgusting.
Dude ain't racist m. Stop lying!
"Trump is talking about himself he saying that’s he is mental, Trump 2024 jail America be great again"
Im racist too. Only thing I like about him
President Trump for America 🇺🇸
This election is a referendum on the strength of American principles vs treasonous liars.
"What Garbage Network.  DC following the UN push to take immigrants is a problem.  We are not required by any moral requirement to take in an unhealthy amount of Migrants.  Trying to create amnesty in 60 days ignores the ability to properly assimilate peoples from other ideologies.   Protecting your Nation from illegal and or to much legal migration is a requirement, not racist.  Regardless if someone is from Ireland or Trinidad Trabego matters not.   Prioer vetting, proper evaluation  if a Person will be a benefit or a Liability are also important considerations."
"I hate that this man-child constantly complains about ""cheating."" He's what almost 80yrs old and he still doesn't talk like an adult. He still acts like a child. It's so f-king annoying"
He is so vile and disgusting.  He has no manners whatsoever.
Trump - look that word up in any dictionary.
This isn't considered media anymore. This is just propaganda by the toilet bowl of America. MSNBC. Right there with the View!! Disgusting
Candace Owens says Kamala isn't even black.  This is going to get embarrassing for the Dems.  That is tonight's news complete with recordings.
The fly is there because he probably pooped his pants
"NO one cheats like the great #45.  He was born a cheater, and a liar.  Anybody would know this.  There, #45, I fixed it for  you."
I can’t wait until the cheaters get prosecuted! Trump 2024!🇺🇸
Why is his hair purple ????
What a negative individual.
The fly came from Trump's former Vice President's hair
Horrifying! And horrifying for crowds that cheer. And for media that don't report on this kind of behavior. He's plain nuts!
Awe 😢Mr. Projection is throwing another pitter-patter tantrum. Kamala hasTRAUMATIZED him!!😱🤯💩😅Mr. Insecure !!😵‍💫🫠🥴😆😂
"Harris is a mental toddler who's never accomplished anything except lying. Trump was a better president than Joe. Oh yeah, give Ukraine US Taxpayer money but not to UD Taxpayer"
Trash + Park 😂
What did she do?
Trump is utterly ignorant.
White guys for Harris? 😂Kamala Harris is a racist liar.<br>I vote for peace & prosperity again.
"A born looser, he is"
Sick
"I am surprised that Donald Trump has not talked about a new law forbidding all men from having a vasectomy,,, I'm surprised it's not even talked about in that 2025 book put out by heritage"
Trump has a fly bc he stinks.  😮
"The fact that Trump is extraordinarily racist is not the problem. He has always been racist. The fact that tens of millions of Americans adore him, adore his racism, and WANT this racist fool to turn America into a hate based nation- THAT is a problem that is not easily solved or will go away."
Trump is scared of her. She is kicking his behind. All of the out if control places is kicking his but. He know he's losing and going to jail. He's flipping out.
"WE ALL KNOW BY NOW,  that a judge in California knew Kamala's father and he talked to her father who  said she is NOT BLACK.<br>How many times do people have to repeat that?"
He is a fool and uneducated!! It’s sooo sad that you people in America would even consider supporting him just listen to him!!! Smh 🤦🏾‍♂️ I can’t wait to vote and it definitely will not be for trump!!!!!
Thinking of Trumps actions and words I am reminded of Hitler <br><br><br>and the Civil War The North and South.  As well as<br>He’s love this to be the divided states like his first term. <br>This is the United States Not the Divided States of America
Truly a despicable man!
He is Dumb and his supporters are Dumber!!!!
Anyone supporting this creature is NOT a true American.  They are a selfish traitor whose ideals and beliefs take precedent over democracy and core values.
"Look at this man and his running mate, they exude evil and hate."
More lies from these two idiots. 🙄
Trump is such a loose cannon!  God help American…seriously 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
This is incredibly sad. How is this type of demeaning and slanderous narrative allowed in any country? If the USA sets the template for the wider developed world then we are in trouble.
Malignant criminal Trump 😊
I could never have imagined that the greatest nation of the world would have a large part of its population so thick as to believe in Trump's endless nonsensical rambling and even applaud. There's definitely something wrong with the country.
"Thanks for the Open Borders,  The Fentanyl Crisis and Venezuelan Gangs Border Czar"
TRUMP IS A POLITICAL CULT LEADER.   😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
Trump still wants that greasy dictatorship to keep himself out of jail. trump is the criminal 😊
"It’s Something Wrong With You, the worst thing you don’t even REALIZE How STUPID you really Are 👺👺👺👺👺😡"
"She and President Joe Biden have failed to secure our nation's southern border, plain and simple. Unlike a lot of issues, this one is not complicated − four more years of Harris will be four more years of the same border chaos.<br>Kamala record is atrocious .<br><br>Believe Kamala Harris, she has shown you who she is.<br>1. Pro-abortion up to and post-birth <br>2. Will close all illegal alien detention centers<br>3. Supports open borders<br>4. Supports amnesty for the approximate 60 million illegal aliens already in the U.S.<br>5. Was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act causing inflation to skyrocket<br>6. Is against fracking<br>7. Supports the eradication of oil, natural gas, and coal as energy sources<br>8. Supports Medicare-for-all, eradicating all private insurance<br>9. Supports price-fixing for Medicare drug perscriptions (Ie, rationing)<br>10. Supports policies resulting in young people no longer being able to buy a home<br>11. Supports government set price controls on food and services<br>12. Supports the war in Ukraine and Israel as a means of shifting wealth from the middle-class to the elite-class<br>13. Hates Israel<br>14. Supports Hamas<br>15. Has supported Bidenomics decimating the U.S. economy<br>16. Has supported policies that result in rising crime<br>17. Supports defunding police"
He is soooo afraid of her😂
"Vote for Trump you don’t have any other choice, can someone tell me something good she (Kamala) did for our country in the last 31/2 years in power?!"
And yet still some black and Latino voters support this RACIST ranting lunacy?  Totally incomprehensible.
"from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao-Dsq5OJTA&t=63"">1:03</a> thru <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao-Dsq5OJTA&t=115"">1:55</a> He's is absolutely right !! JUST he mentioned the wrong name. Should've been ""Trump"" each time he said Kamala. In that case it would've been spot on. WHAT A SICK MAN."
Thanking everyone voting blue.  💙💯
All stupid
This guy soul is trouble he will have a serious time when he have to give an account to God. The guy is very weird and lies so much.
"The Republicans are done. Over, forget about it."
Donald Trump is the biggest joke and the biggest danger to our democracy.
And it's a close race? Really? Half of America thinks this grifting conman is admirable. Jesus save us.
Again. Why isn't this criminal locked up.
Most disgusting individuals EVER
ABSOLUTELY CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE ATTACKED THE CAPITAL RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AND!!!! NOT ARRESTED!!!😅😂🤣😅😂🤣😅😂🤣
He’s afraid he’ll lose and end up in prison.
😂😂😂😂
"Talk about PROJECTION. There's only 1 person in this race incapable of pronouncing the other's name. Talk about ""stupid""! Give me a break!"
"Look into Curtis Yarvin who is cited by Vance. Vance says he wants to cut out parts of government ""like a tumor"" by electing a dictator who would do this. He wants to fire university faculty and sell their ""attractive campuses"" to real estate developers. Kind of important for people to know."
washing youself helps against flys...
"I hope there are enough Haitians & Jamaicans in Florida, who are offended by Trump, that they will vote to flip Florida to Blue. All that is needed is 400,000 votes. Karma is a powerful thing... If Florida flips, there is little chance for Trump to win."
"It's such a bad speech you would think it was satire or some kind of parody. Just an angry, bitter, hateful, little old man."
"Notice Trumo reserves his comments of stupid and low IQ statements to those who are black, showing Trump's blatant.<br>Although I focused on Trump's out of bounds rascist comments to Kamala Harris who is not only Trump's political opponent, but at the samr time our vice president,  i do not wish in any way minimize the outright hateful and dangerous baseless rasist comments and accusations against all people of color and differing nationalities.  All his comments must be condemned in the strongest ways possible."
"This is so disturbing, Trump can't say any facts or give evidence to support his claims so he results to insults and lies. Pathetic"
First he say they're stupid people then that they're smart
"If you don’t think Donald Trump is a racist, you’re either in denial or a racist yourself, period. <br><br>Sad to know someone like that can run for the highest office in America and actually win. Says a little something about most Americans in this country. <br><br>Thank goodness Jesus Christ has the final say with the world and Donald’s life. Every believer and Christian all over the world please pray very hard for Mr. Trump that he may see the error of his ways, for one day he WILL be judged by our father and creator of all. <br><br>Jesus loves every one of his children including Donald, so I hope he can change his heart and turn his life around before it’s too late. Remember, going to church or putting money in the offering plate on Sunday doesn’t make you a Christian, so Trump can’t use that card. <br><br>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done; on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.<br><br>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me."
The courts says that they didncheat already
"When I saw the first debate between Harris and Trump, saw white vs color. In other words, white on the outside3, darkness on the inside. dark on the outside, light on the inside."
President Harris you doing  great. I worry about her because Trump get worse everyday protect Lord
There are many traitors in this country. They're all at Trump rallies.
IS MSNBC GOING TO SUPPORT  300 MILLION AND MORE AMERICANS?  <br>WHAT IS YOUR PLAN?  <br>KAMALA'S PLAN IS TO TAKE BILLIONS FROM OUR BUSINESSES AND USE IT TO MAKE THEMSELVES (DEMOCRAT LIFELONG BUREAUCRATS) LOOK GOOD WHEN THEY HAVE NOT CONTRIBUTED ANYTHING - BUT THEY SURE HAVE TAKEN US TAXES.
"The way Trump paints the American carnage, nobody can fix it, even the Orange himself. According to Trump, America is the worse country on earth! Who wants to run this dirty USA?!"
"Trump is NOT CRAZY.  He is a businessman and our country runs on BUSINESS taxes!  
<br>When will you get that through your heads?  
<br>Kamala has been supported by taxes for most of her working life - so has Biden.
<br>When will you UNDERSTAND the most basic elements of our economy?
<br>WHERE WOULD ANYONE GET THE MONEY TO RUN A TRILLION DOLLAR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT - NOT TO MENTION ALL THE OTHER GOVERNMENTS.  IF IT WERE NOT FOR BUSINESSES WHO EMPLOY MILLIONS?
<br>FORMER GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE,
<br>LEI
<br>BACHELOR OF SCIENCE - SOCIOLOGY"
You are smarter than this lunatic. Don't be trumped.
Wait!!!  A fly???  Is that because his diaper is full of 💩????
An investigation needs to be done for the education system in red states.  The lack of rational thinking is truly terrifying.<br>DonnyOLD is decaying and attracting more flies
What is he on???
Biden-Harris Administration Has Intentionally Left Us Vulnerable allowing illegal migrants to invade our country . They should be criminally charged. You filtered lying news is why our country is a disaster. Can you imagine Harris making foreign policy?  God help us.
Trump is a radical communist dictator. Trump is a mentally disturbed individual.   Something is seriously wrong with Trump. Trump mouth is out of control.
Trump is a very bad person 🤬. He needs to go to a jail.
"So, donnie, are you running away from debating a ""mentally disabled person""? Interesting!"
There is a difference between freedom of speech and hate speech and lies - this is the latter
she never was voted into a government position always appointed tells you alot about her
"Another war brewing, hurricane devastation, long shore man strike, inflation, do we really want do nothing hyena in charge .  Are we Americans or American'ts. She is not a leader of men."
This is exactly how hitler got started
Jamal sucks
Can't understanding myself. There should be a wide gap in this election  towards harris. WE'VE got some crazy people . He mentions GOD?!!! HOW DARE HE!!! BETTER WATCH OUT TRUMP HOW YOU TALK ABOUT GOD. JUST LISTEN TO HIM?!!! DO YOU REALLY WANT A PRESIDENT LIKE THIS?
Impossible to understand for no Americans.. 360 million people and the best they can pick up as candidates to Presidency are a completely crazy guy and an eternally laughing lady with zero charisma. Amazing!
Republicans are finished!
I've noticed msnbc and NBC only report bad about Trump and they TRY  to make Kamala look good. He told the truth about the immigrants.
Can you hear the sick people in the background. 😢
"This Want be dictator, and his cult followers are crazy 🤪."
We should be e calling out the people who clap and praise his retoric
"This goes to show us how crazy are delusional Trump is. He’s always telling on himself. People really need to listen at the nut, his brain is gone. All he’s running on is hatred and violence. What a shame!"
Now they are concerned kind of late in the game
Stop playing that monkey.... You guys give him power by continuously playing his words.
The fly is from the omen
Your wife Mr Trump can't speak English
This old criminal will not succeed his try to steal the election. This guy is a mentally damaged criminal.
Trump needs to be committed  he is dangerous to the country  they are going  end up in  riots he is trying to stoke the fire for people to  fight for him trump is corrupt

this is very sad to see... glad i'm not american
Not sure who is worse him or his maggots smfh
Looking forward to the day liesalot trump loses ! !
Careful what you ask for Trump!!!
"Foreign Gangs Take Root in America’s Sanctuary Cities. America can no longer ignore the consequences of its failed experiment with sanctuary cities and unchecked illegal immigration. The problem has metastasized beyond our southern border and now threatens communities throughout the nation...
<br>
<br>The latest outrage is happening because of the loud-and-proud sanctuary city of Denver, Colorado, where foreign gangs have found sanctuary alongside the illegal immigrants. Mayor Michael Johnston, the third-worst sanctuary mayor in America, has championed an effort to fund myriad programs for illegal aliens at the expense of police, public parks, and Department of Motor Vehicles budgets, among other legitimate concerns of citizens. As a result, nearly 40,000 aliens have arrived in the Mile High City since December 2022...
<br>
<br>Denver is not the only sanctuary city where Tren de Aragua has set up operations. In New York City, the gang has masterminded a crime ring that steals New Yorkers’ smart phones, uses the financial data on them to plunder victims’ bank accounts, and then sells the phones in South America. The gang has also used the city’s migrant hotels as places to extort money from residents and to recruit new members.
<br>
<br>In sanctuary Chicago, a 911 call has gone viral, detailing a Tren de Aragua takeover of an apartment building by 32 gang members that sounds almost identical to the incident in Aurora. In response, a video posted on X by a Chicago resident suggested that further takeover attempts by Tren de Aragua would be met with violence by homegrown gangs. So, in addition to all the other bad consequences of sanctuary policies, cities like Chicago should now brace for shootouts in the streets between American and foreign gangs. Is this part of how “immigration makes us stronger,” as sanctuary mayors have told us ad nauseam?"
"Democrats allow openly racist remarks such as Letitia saying that Trump is ""too pale"".  So that means Kamala and Biden and Walz are all too pale, as well.
<br>Native Americans wanted a WALL, and they also owned black slaves.
<br>Who should decide which race is the one to determine our standards??????"
"Two illegal immigrants have been indicted for allegedly conspiring to kidnap and ransom other illegals living in Southern California, federal authorities said Monday. The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a statement that Honduran Darwin Jeovany Palma, 30, and fellow national Eduar Isrrael Sauceda Nuñez, 25, allegedly planned to kidnap and ransom immigrants illegally crossing the U.S. – Mexico border.  Migrants were allegedly taken to stash houses in Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico where their cellphones were confiscated, the DOJ said, adding that 57 migrants were held at a stash house in Albuquerque"
A Hugh Blue Tsunami in coming this November General Election.  Trump for Prison 2024.  Lock Him Up.  😹
"So tired of the racist, tropes and false claims of racism from MSNBC pendents and so-called journalist that I would say are better suited for tabloids but that would be an insult the tabloids.  Morning Joe and Mika are partisan hacks lacking any credibility."
Get out and Vote for Democrats up and down the ballot. 💙💙💙💙💙💙
Yet both of them are better than Trump@!
Doesn’t this feel like Germany circa 1933??? 🤔
And the fact that this race is so close goes to show you what kind of lunatics there are in America that support this lunatic
WE thought 'SPANK YOUR CHILD ONCE A DAY...' Bumper Stickers was thing of the Past 🍀🇨🇦⚜️
WE so sorry aboot youz Civil War - such NARCISISTIC NARRATIVE - so so sorry to hear 🍀🇨🇦⚜️
Sick. He is just SICK.
I feel like I lose brain cells listening to him
I need to go on Joe.  I've studied this.  A reference to mental handicap is Hitler speech for euthanasia.  His reference to the fly is a straight out Hitler call to exterminate a race or group.
There is a fly because Trump is possessed and he needs to be exorcised😂 …Everything he said on those speeches are more likely him😂
"It is the Democrat Party who began sending racist e-mails back in 2007 or earlier.  Written by Deepak Chopra saying he hated all small towns in America and all of Alaska.  Oh, really?<br>MINORITIES live in both places.  <br>What a dork!!!!  <br>Democrats allow openly racist remarks such as Letitia saying that Trump is ""too pale"".  So that means Kamala and Biden and Walz are all too pale, as well.<br>Native Americans wanted a WALL, and they also owned black slaves.<br>Who should decide which race is the one to determine our standards??????"
"Vote Blue, save our democracy and freedoms!  Time to erase any memory of Trump and move forward!"
"Magician 's trick, look over there  so you don't see how I'm fooling you with these lies. 😢"
I am just as disturbed by the people clapping & cheering. 😢
"Those maga nutjobs behind him are paid to hold up those banners, how idiotic can they be."
Trump's mind lives in a dungeon.
How did Philadelphia cheat? They have always swung blue 😂
He is the most disrespectful human being ever at nearly 80 years old. May God have mercy on his soul!😢
How is Donald Trump racist by calling somebody stupid lol 😂 MSNBC is only creating victim mentality.
And that is the best the Republican party has to offer.
He is just projecting … it is so obvious! Lol
"Everyone hates you, Trump… except for your ridiculous cult, followers who just haven’t made sense of things yet, but they will"
And cursed with God’s name
…not only took God’s name in vain but lied with God’s name in the same breath
Why does MSNBC keep showing  Trump talking this mess?
Trump is the stupid person.
Good show!
Crowd size and trashing women. He'll say anything to keep the attention away from his tiny... life
The real Racists are MSNBC  🖕
Who really listen to the msnbc. If you only listen to Joe and Mika then you are in your own little world who edit and leave out what Trump is saying in his full speech instead of scheming to undermine America.
"If you pay attention to what makes Trump supporters yell in support of what he is saying, you will always find it is because Trump said something vile."
IT WILL BE SO NICE FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. When this is over. This brings back the divide as of the 1900 to the 60s. Many people lost their lives because the words of others. The problem today is more people won't stand to be abused willing.
Does the 'M' in your name (MSNBC) stand for Marxism?<br>Not even sociologists want Marxism.  <br>And black sociologists do not want illegal immigration.
",,😂😂😂😂"
"President Trump is right in what he said. Its true she wrecked the Border, allowing all those people in to USA. She is mental."
He's talking about his self
"So MSDNC calls someone racist. What else is new? Someone who isn't racist? That would be news, but we know that can't happen, since everything and everyone is already racist according to these chicken littles."
Nothing but bots in this comment section. Whether they are ai or actual people is irrelevant since the effect is the same.
My grandson witnessed Tim Walz flipping off Michigan fans Saturday at the Michigan Minnesota football game who were chanting 'Trump 24 Baby'. Walz is a classless buffoon.
Weird no longer begins to describe it
Long life for Donald Trump❤❤❤❤❤
"Instead of ""sleepy joe"", it should be ""Sleepy Donald"", ""Low Energy Donald"""
Hillary was ahead by 12 points just two weeks before the 2016 election. BIden was up by 7.<br>Harris needs to up her race game.   More race cards Kamala !!
What we have here in America is MAGA REDUMPLICANS VS REPUBLICANS!!! The REPUBLICANS as we know it have been taken over by MAGA REDUMPLICANS!!! I completely applauded the Real Republicans voting for HARRIS/WALZ to stump Trump in Roevember for all rights!!!💙💙💙
You are a flier dude!!
This channel is such trash.
Notice all the cities he says are out of control are cities that have minorities; He's vying for a race war
Panicking and desperation Trump is scared of going to jail.
TRUMP IS CIRCLING THE DRAIN 😂😂😂
That person is so jealous of Harris winning... 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

Say it to her face Don Lol
Hahaha the media is trying everything they can they running scared!
He’s saying dems are cheating .. over and over again he says it. We now know the topic of chaos coming after Election Day .
Nothing like a mentally ill person calling others mentally ill. Look 👀 mentally ill people clapping along. They have no idea what’s coming with him.
That's freedom of speech.  They called Hitler that is worst.
Great I have the bevis and butthead Tokyo rose on my utube feed
Little Don
Those cheating in the elections are shaking..😂😂😂
Everyone on their side because you let your anger get the better side of you
"This election on November, it will be a landslide win by kamala Harris 🎉🎉🎉"
The only one trying to cheat is Donald Trump in the Republican party they're trying to pass laws to cheat right now as we speak and it's not going to happen we will not allow it and Donald Trump will never be in power we will not let him in
I'm a white female and I stand with Springfield against Pig faced dictator Donald Trump. He must be jailed for his crimes as soon as the election is over
He is Garbage appealing to the Garbage.
"TRUMPS ""JEALOUS"" BECAUSE HE KNOWS PUTIN..LIKES KAMALA..BETTER!"
He needs to be gone
"Since the Walz/Vance debate is tonight... I'm wondering if Walz or the moderators will bring up Vance's past (truly damning) comments about trump? I've not seen anyone (media,etc.) ask him to explain his 180 regarding trump!"
Only. People who are. Voteing for. Trump. Are. Racist. Police. Officers. Church people. Racist people
That lunatic is preparing his lunatic supporters to act up when he loses this election. We MUST be ready for it!
"Trump is saying they can’t speak English.  Who in the heck can understand what his wife is saying when she talks, an immigrant."
"Trump is ridiculous. He’s desperate. And when he mention the Bible”, I’m at a loss for words,  he held it upside down because he wasn’t  familiar with it. Vote Blue."
God. Forbid.  Trump.   Wining. !  Trump. Against. The. Jews.  Trump is. Racist. Amen 🙏
Trump sounds like he’s drunk. Not tipsy but just drunk. Scary
Republicans are.  Racist
Trump is a racist and a Dictator
"Surprised he has not grown a little mustache. He's crazy. I believe the only ""people"" who cheated in the last Election, where all attached to the MAGA nut's."
Only a fool would vote for four more years of what we just had. js.
What did she do?
Weeks ago Trump said he wanted the America from 300 years ago and to this day not one news orginasation has commented or denounced it. And now he gets worse and feels majority of white wants the same. Every true American Christian as well as the other dinosaurs ask yourself is that the behaviour Jesús would display. No but it is what Satan has done since God created Man and woman.Think❤😮
Im concern about new supporters for Trump in whole heartly; him: prob your fired within a second! Im a conservative dont appreciate   verbal abuse not ever not now.
Trump has fully lost his mind!😮😮😮😮
Met Gods grace 2x! God giveth god take it away has harden his ❤ even more.😈😈he listens & mixes Rebuke that in Jesus name
"'exhaustion' and 'boredom' of attendees at these rallies, deftly mentioned by Harris in the debate,: observe at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao-Dsq5OJTA&t=233"">3:53</a> mark , with guy in sunglasses resting his head, from having to hear Trump's gibberish ad nauseam"
Imagine if Chump becomes more mentally defiicient or dies in office. JD Vance would be leader of the free world. Truly horrific.
"It's so ironic that Chump projects his lies and cons on what he actually is guilty of. He blames Harris for voter fraud when he is the only past President that denied a fair election, prevented and created chaos to divide people when we have worldwide dysfunction and will surly destroy democracy."
Trump should be in prison

Trump is very dangerous man for society !!!!<br><br>Hariss is the most intelligent and honest leader !!! She will America as a great nation and contribute great world peace !!!
I just had to come back over here to this channel just to see for myself that over 50% of the country hates Donald Trump over his ego and don't love him for his peace and prosperity policies 50% of the country at least is supposed to be voting for Kamala Harris Personally as a United States veteran did not think when I wore the uniform of the United States of America that the flag on my arm that's so many through the generations have fought and died over would be hated by its own people nor did I believe that over half of my country was stupid enough or dumb enough or gullible enough to vote for Kamala Harris specially after the last four years but I knew if they existed I would be able to find them in the comments here to those who hate over personality I say do you don't vote vote for Kamala so Trump loses so many people going to let hatred for one man destroy the fabric and foundations of the millions of men and women who died and fought for this country and what that flag truly represents to jeopardize the freedoms that's made America great for so long we've all had our faults our country has had its faults but so is every country that's ever existed on the face of this planet hate all you want but love your families those that are here and those who sacrifice before so you can be where you are today usually I'm aggressive short tempered and have no patience for stupidity it will get you killed maybe just one kid in high school may read this just know the power the Democrats hold is because of their ability to manipulate young minds like you to manipulate the minds of our elderly through lies and deceit through treasonous actions with our enemies the Democrats created racism Democrats created the Ku Klux Klan Jim Crow laws were all passed by Democrats they use social media to distort history and the facts of the current times they project which means publicly they accuse their opponents of what they know they are doing themselves and what they are responsible for they only care about power and so does most rhino Republicans I called them Bush Republicans who only want war power and money that goes along with both Donald Trump is different as his policies are at odds with both sides of the aisle it's why he's hated so bad if Trump is all about his self that should be fine with you he will not allow himself to look bad or to fail he wants to look strong and tough all our qualities we need to never give up on what we believe in America should be strong not made to look bad in this country should never give up on his core principles of the constitution which is kept us on top. If you join the military or serve your country in any capacity officially for the government or through the government you will have to say an oath to that constitution defended against all enemies foreign and domestic my friends the CIA the FBI military intelligence so-called homeland security are compromised by those that I spoke of earlier we must protect the constitution we must be strong and brave the CIA and the FBI are running propaganda operations on Americans on American soil it may be why you think the way you do and why you have come to their channel here to be fed more propaganda get your bellies full digest what I've told you and what comes out is exactly what they're selling you don't have to tell nobody but you can have pride in your country if you're not a strong person mentally or physically it doesn't mean you can be intelligent and make the right decisions so as a United States veteran who serve my country I say to the people of this country to the young in school or just got out in college to those in the nursing home that can still read and see this text don't leave this world worse than it was when you were here it is up to every one of us to do something they divide us with money with race with political parties R's I's or D's we are Americans don't be manipulated and even if you shall be manipulated turn your head hold your nose and push that button for Donald J Trump he has shown he is willing to sacrifice his life for this country what anybody else running in this race do the same give him what he's earned if it's not your respect give him your vote then come back to this stream in four years it will be clear to you that you have been a victim to Propaganda And their deep state operation you will know you've made the right decision your life will be better your families life will be better there is no other alternative on the ballot make the right decision America the world depends on it make us proud to represent the people of this great country God give you wisdom and the strength to do what's right not what you like George Orwell 1982 was his last lecture George called them the police now we call him MSNBC fact checkers we are one team we are one people we are Americans!  🇺🇸🫡
Trump is the the symptom of a brainless and bigoted culture. Neonazis need to be dealt with.
🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿🙏🏿for the mind😞
"Trump is like a Halloween pumpkin, orange on the outside, hollow inside, and gets thrown out in November"
And he promised a bloodbath! 😂😂 idiots! 😂
"It's a chore just to listen his annoying voice, never mind the nonsense he's talking."
Americans Witness the Desperate Criminal in Action with Lies and Conspiracy Theories Trump is a lunatic
"If you are a United States citizen and registered voter, l urge you to please PRAY before you vote.<br>Pay attention to the personal revelation you receive.<br>Do not vote based on party lines, rumors, or peer pressure.<br>Think about Christ, and the example which he provided us.<br>We should love our neighbors and help those in need- not judge and condemn. ❤🇺🇸💙<br>I am praying for unity, freedom, and democracy for our nation."
Msnbc is fat phobic
LOL. This comment section😂. Unhinged dems. 2 brain cells shared by hundreds.
He's really describing himself
"He's still p*<b>**</b> about the debate, and he got destroyed on national t v"
Total projection from Don the Con Drumpf...
"I love how he talks about cheating, yet the elector college waves in favour of republicans"
You need to keep GOD OUT OF YOUR EVIL MOUTH
The unfortunate of being gullible
"Jan 6th, Fake electors plot, pressured Mike Pence to certify his FAKE electors, talking about suspending the constitution, tried to hide his connection to Project2025, talks about being a dictator for ""only a day"" or ""only an hour""...etc.<br><br>This man IS in position to be our Hitler.<br>The targets may be different, but the hate, the scapegoating, the lies, and the dictator attempts are in full effect.<br>DON'T be a tool for hate, YOU could be next on the chopping block."
Its time to get Democrats out we cant afford four more years !!!!!!
A NEW DANGEROUS want to be HILTER
He is disgusting…
He's right go trump
"Trump must come to the Power asap !!! Russia & Ukraine war + disputes with China have Decreased the Cash Flow through out the Global & due to sanctions we've literally banned Cheap Resources alternatives from Russia & China & forced to Buy same resource from Remaining Producers with limited resources at 3× & 20× prices. Further, putting Pressure on existing Cash flow. We can't afford the War for too long. 1 missile is costing almost 5 job loss here. Biden isn't telling the world that Whole Aviation industry has stalled as, Russia is key Producer of  Material & alloys required to manufacture engine blades here. This, is something that lucky came on surface we don't know how many industries are struggling from the same problem. Volkswagen is about to bankrupt due to EV and but, what they don't tell is it had to let go it's largest market Russia."
Trump is dramatic but because we don't live in a free country we have choice  A or B hands down I choose Trump
The dude is crazy!
Shut up
We love that man!!!! God bless every Republican in the planet🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
"This clown is all the way CRAZY, but most of all he is dangerous VOTE BLUE"
"D🍊N🤥LD, the card nobody wants to play no more. Escaped from the insane asylum together with all his supporters, now walking freely around in the US. This once Worldpower is heavily rotting from inside…"
"America is being warned by Dr. Bandy Lee's diagnosis of Trump mental incapacity Take Dr. Bandy, seriously. <br><br>One thing I like about Americans is that we do not prevent things from happening, but we like to fix things after the damage is already done. This is the situation with Trump."
America you are the laughing stock of the world
"No political Figure in America, Republican or Democrat, is more ""Mentally Impaired"" than Trump. After crying that America is a Failing Nation, after saying the Economy is in a sad shape, after saying that people cannot afford necessities. Trump comes up with new plan to fleece his supporters: $500 Watches for the poor MAGA, $100,000 Watches for the rich MAGA...!!!...So, the people who are in such a bad shape, should spend their money to buy his Watches...LOL"
Crime is down because what happens inside Trump properties are not being reported.
"Border Czar Kamala Harris  could have closed the border 3.5 years ago.  Harris wants middle class taxpayers to pay for unvetted migrants housing and health carte.  NYC has paid 5.5 billion dollars to migrants and migrant crime is up in NYC.<br><br>Harris lied when she said the border was secure, that bidenomics was working ,that Biden was fit to be president, that Trump will sign an abortion ban and was ordered by a judge to hand over exculpatory evidence to defendants her office prosecuted."
"Kamala sure is remarkably accomplished for one who has been ""mentally impaired since birth"""
TRUMP 2024.
Will America have a purge? Wow 🤯
"Hey people, LEARN how to FLIP the lost souls drinking Trump's Kool-Aid. If you don't know how, contact me to learn."
"i cannot help but wonder how freaked out trump would be if the media did the smart thing in their reporting by:<br>a.  mearly stating, ""trump did another stupid thing today."" and then NOT saying what he did or said,<br>b.  go on to report on something that Kamala or Tim is doing."
MSNBC spreading the democrat progressive liberal woke lies spread all over the place. See you at the polls in November. Can’t wait. TRUMP 2024!!!!!! 🙂👍🙏
Does tomm tim scott agree?
Because Morning Joe fans believe anything....lol
I love the reaction of the people in the back ...They are so concerned of him talking all nonsense
2.45 Because ( I ) wouldn't have to cheat.
It sounds like there are only a couple dozen people in those DT rallies. Sad!
He's totally off his trolley. Anyone who actually possesses the  normal cognitive faculties would discern that this guy is in a severe mental decline. The fly stuff....... hes just WEIRD.
"for someone who claims to be a ""stable genius"" the man is so very WACKO STUPID!!!<br>(and not at all logical!!)"
That a lie!!! Everyone speak English in Ohio my home state!!!
"The ghost help he is bringing to the victims of Helene is a sight to behold,this guy was born lying!!!"
It’s like something compels him to project. He’s literally talking about himself. Oh no another fly 😂😂😂😂
Everything Trump says is projection at its finest. How sad.
Flies? Blame your leaky diaper.
"He has the face of a person that went mad, for real! Something is worse with him lately! More than usual. You can see it in his eyes."
"Trump is out of his mind, plain and simple. Gone round the bend. Crazy train has left the station."
Trump is “Lord of the Flies “
There's no longer any maintaining the fiction that MAGA cultists are misguided dupes. They're just plain evil.
The fly escaped from his diaper!
Only a mentally impaired person would suggest a PURGE OF VIOLENCE. <br>All these states are states that are turning away from him . <br>HE IS A PSYCHOPATH!<br>   Donnie- the fly is around you bc YOU STINK TO MUCH FOR AMERICA.
"God came down from ""a high""        ???"
Attempt a coup and still get to run for president after.
"Every time he opens his fat mouth, he loses votes. Keep up the good work 45, you are such a loser!"
Trump is deplorable.  His words are ugly. KH’s resume is impressive.  Trump is unfit and his toxic rhetoric should be called out by repubs with a backbone
I nominate tRump for the STUPID Award! Are you smarter than a first grader? Geesh!!!
You will lose again  .<br>Only great presidents get  RE-ELECTED
"He is more incontinent now, shuffling around with pounds of make up on will do that."
"He doesn't care anymore, he's a desperate old man saying anything to stay out of prison."
I'm disappointed in American voters... This garbage is only 5% points down! SMDH
My guess is Trump is going to continue to spiral as we get closer to Election Day. Don’t be surprised if more profanity is used by him and more racist language. He’s channeling the worst underbelly of America and let’s pray there’s enough of us that he doesn’t win again.
This man is shameful 😢
Trump - what a piece of work he is! 🤨
tRump wants to lose.
"The bullying, lies, threats and insults are really getting old...."
How low can Trump go? How low can Trump supporters go?😢
Shut him up puhleeeeze! <br>His whole campaign is like a sick manifesto.
It is said that a criminal hides their criminality by putting blame on others.  When does he stop?
Americans are getting sick and tired of the Media calling everything racist
"wanna understand why we choose trump?<br><br>Trump is not lying. Why doesn’t someone tell me why kamel isn’t or hasn’t fixed any of our countries issues? We the people are America, what happened to voting for people who make positive change? Kamel and Biden are the starting point for continuous crime in our country and it’s definitely not a bright looking future with her. If you think they aren’t puppets controlled by the strings of those who see us people as nothing but useless and disgusting, then you haven’t done enough to learn what’s going on.<br><br>If you want to understand why a majority of people support trump it’s not because he’s perfect, it’s because he’s not controlled or influenced by anyone, money, or power. And he’s repeatedly built success from nothing in his business life, and has shown to replicate those skills towards the country when in office. He simply had what it takes to make America great again. I believe he wants to die with that goal being completed with his name behind it, I don’t at all believe he just wants power as an older guy with kids and more money than everyone in this comment section combined."
"I am Vladimir, (not bot) and I generate fair and balanced political commentary:<br><br>Comrade Trump is NOT a RACIALIST!<br>Also, NOT treasonous dog!<br><br>(Repeat, not bot)"
Double down? He quadruple down!!
Outside of lower taxes for people who have more than enough money and violence violence violence. What are his policies? I am genuinely curious?
This comment section is even dumber than the CNN comment section. MSNBC is some piece of work.
"It is absolutely clear that the POS former president has self-destructed, and that he will again lose the presidential election."
"lol, still using the racism word?"
"This man is full of hate and dumb too. Not one rally he talk about economy, infaltion, child care, abortion right, women right vote , tax cut..and what is wrong wiyh his supporters head because they are be brainwash of stupid convicted trump propaganda"
"@Mitch McConnell this is your legacy.  As a life long Republican, I see you destroyed the party by not holding yourself and your party accountable when it would have been trivial.  All you have now is a paerson speaking for you in incoherent (and legally actionable) threats.  The Republican party deserved substantially better from you."
He makes me absolutely nauseous!!!! I can't believe he has followers.
"Donmentia has no business questioning anybody else's intellect. He's clearly a senile, rambling, ranting, raving racist who can't express an intelligent thought."
You can really hear the racism
All Donvict does is spout klannish-Hitleresque rhetoric to his klan member saltine audience.
Not long ago his fans would have been looked on with pity. Now it's with disgust.
"The people cheering on the old man’s middle school-level insults, incredibly repulsive."
"I know these clips have to be shared so we can all see what a fruit cake he is, but I’m so over hearing that voice, sooner he’s locked up the better."
"Well, what's gonna happen.. If Trump lost the next election "".. perhaps he goes to create another January 6 again...* Because he will can not deport the Haitians,. As he promised*.. and vance said he goes to create history and he doesn't like this people.. that's why he married with a white woman. ?"
How can the race be tight. Incredible
Why does the orange orang utan always look like he's melting...
"The ""extraordinary racists are on YOUR network, right Joy Reid????"
"SELLING LIES, HATE, ASSASSINATIONS FOR PROFIT BY MSNBC AND CNN
<br>Experts agree that the near assassination of Former President Donald Trump by troubled and mentally disturbed teenager was caused by the constant irrational attacks on Trump especially constantly referring to him as Hitler. To an irrational mind like the shooter, there is a moral justification to shooting Hitler since Hitler killed 12 million human beings including the gassing of 6 million Jews. The Democratic Convention proved that the Democrats have no policy or position to solving any of the huge problems threatening the survival of today’s America and America’s Middle class and lower class. The only platform they are running on is hating Donald Trump and mentioned his name over 300 times on just the first night- again calling him Hitler and a threat to American democracy. MSNBC is not about Journalism but is a leftist organization that  leads the nation in promoting lies and hate speech and simply parroting  the daily scripts given to them by the Democrats and the deep state. MSNBC is owned by NBCUniversal whose CEO is a person named Michael Cavanagh. NBCUniversal is owned by Comcast whose CEO is Brian L. Roberts. The question is why Cavanagh and Roberts allow MSNBC to continue spewing this hate and divisiveness that twice almost killed Donald Trump? Trump is a compassionate man with a loving wife and wonderful children and grandchildren whose lives would be severely impacted by his death. The answer could possibly be that Roberts and Cavanagh put money and profits ahead of morality and are selling lies and hate for profit. How can they live with themselves? Is this the example they are proud to show to their families and friends? Is there any decency left in corporate America? Do they send their children to schools that  put Tampons in boy’s bathrooms as signed into law by the  democratic nominee for Vice President who makes fun of people like JD Vance who went to Yale University -a condemnation of Yale graduates which is repeated frequently on MSNBC. Is Yale university happy with this? Does Cavanagh’s and Robert’s salary and stock options, if any, derived from MSNBC’s constant lies and hate speech that almost resulted in the death of Donald Trump ? These are questions that should be answered regarding the management of MSNBC and Comcast. In my case I would advise parents not to send their children or contribute to Yale University, not to watch MSNBC or NBC and do business with any company owned by Comcast. MSNBC and CNN are failing as Americans wake up to their lies Cavanaugh and Roberts should be brought before congress to testify under oath why MSNBC is ignoring traditional and investigating journalism and just parroting daily talking points given to them by the democratic party and the deep state in order to create havoc, divisiveness and attempted assassinations. Shame on them."
He is slurring and having a meltdown
"Everyone knows that Donvict is a racist pathological liar. The problem is <i>most of the mainstream media.</i> They need to stop sane-washing Donvict's vile, racist, inflammatory rhetoric about immigrants. Most of all, the media needs to start calling his language racist. 😡"
What a disgusting racist 😡
Wow... is that your go to word? 😂😂😂  you sound like whiny middle school girls.
"Yes, please, mainstream media. Keep campaigning for America's Favorite Wine Mom and taking <br>edited video snippets  with usual sheep screams of ""Raaaaay Cisss Emmmmm ""  ! <br><br>These two combed and blow dried talking heads make me sick. <br><br>Trump/Vance 2024 !"
Who thinks this thing can run Our country when he doesn't have a coherent thought in his head? The media needs to stop treatingwhat he says as normal.  Call him out as nonfunctional.  His speeches are bs.  He makes no sense.  Get rid of him.
"So many Destroyers, so little time lol.  Keep keeping it real Ohn!"
Please lock him up after he loses lol
Ya are bunch of liars trump is going to win
Ya are bunch of liars trump is going to win
"Common sense should prevail but many cheer and think Orangina's behavior is just fine. Apparently they need to be told daily that his behavior is NOT functional, normal, rational or ""Presidential"". <br><br>There's a cult phenomenon that renders pointing this out even repeatedly unsuccessful. Still, the newscasters should continue to try. Not trying just normalizes Orangina's appalling behavior and obvious inability to serve. <br><br>This Independent will Vote Blue! For us and for those who don't know what they're supporting. 💙"
"When the Left has no argument , no policy, and after 4 years in office no results, you can always depend upon them to play the race card."
"He's deranged and intentionally hurts people.  The people clapping and cheering are already suffering the choices they are making in their lives.  The ""libs"" aren't their problem.  They are."
TRUMP/VANCE 2024 !!!!!
"GOP, REPUBLICAN PARTY, Donald Trump BROKE IT and now YOU OWN IT!!!!"
Kamala makes racist remarks about Trump! You need to stop calling out Trump when Kamala does her own race thing!!
"Harris always promoted she was Indian left & right in California.<br>Now that she is running for President, ALL OF A SUDDEN SHE IS BLACK!<br>Yeah, shes a racist"
"Kamala is mentally impaired, yet why is Chump still hesitant to debate her? During their last debate, Chump didn't even glance at her once."
Why is our country allowing trump to spew insults and dangerous rhetoric??? Wow !! He divides this country and the republicans continue to support him
He said he wants to militarize police. Are MAGATS So ignorant they think that WONT affect them?
He's not a bright guy
Yeah 2 years ago Grandpa Trump wasn't crapping his pants which now attracts the flies.
"As always, Chump, you're being a coward. You talk a big game behind her back, but when it comes to confronting her in person, you can't even look her in the eye."
"tRUMP is terrified of strong women, so his defense against them is to try and demean them.  He’s furious that Kamala was thoroughly prepared and she mopped the floor with him during the debate…she humiliated him and cut him off at the knees….so this is his way of retaliating….like some kind of a spoiled rotten little kid.  He’s no longer interested in winning the election…he just wants to get his posse all riled up so they’ll unleash a bunch of violence on his behalf. He’s a pathetic and pitiful excuse for a man.  How anyone could’ve ever thought it was a good idea for him to be the President of the USA is beyond my comprehension!"
Les démocrates ont laise tombe
What is the dislike count on this video?
With that purple hair he looks like the clown that he is.
TRUMP 2024
Poor thing that debate about to send him straight to a nursing home he's GONE GONE..  We all see it unfolding

You lost!!!<br>dana t.
During this election I made a firm decision to NEVER VOTE FOR ANY REPUBLICAN PARTY MEMBER in any kind of election. Their policy is lying and cheating.
"""If God came down from high"".... There would be no MAGA people left...."
You idiotic commentators - why are you playing his stupid comments.
Who is calling the kettle black??!!
He doesn’t care about disabled people and this shows it.

"Evil has reared its ugly head in America. The world will suffer if this monster is re elected, because he has a debt to settle. He is a bitter and sick man, out for Blood."
None of those Republican men or Republican women would dare say it to Trumps face. They know they will get their azz tore up by Trump.
Talking about crime and corruption is racist?
BC he knows his base is racist.
"He just wants to play games with you, he wants to talk about him"
"He's talking about himself,  right ? 🤫 and in regards to cheating,  he's  GUILTY as charged !"
Trump has flies favorite food in his diaper...that's why...hahaha
He sees the writing on the wall and he’s desperate.
Trump 2024
Where are you clowns fleeing to in November?
Peope should remember trump is the third generation  From Germany.. <br>And should not expect anything else or better..
I agree democrats should take a voting test
"I don't know if there is any black person in Their right mind or if having anything about themselves would support racists, norcissist old man ? <br>I can't wait for the election to be over and he lost this election.. <br>I am tired of hearing his voice and seeing him on my television.."
"It's funny, I never hear them say anything negative about Kamala Harris."
Dude needs serious psychiatric intervention.  And an exorcism.
"""If god came down from a high...😂"
"What's actually really stupid about the whole one day of violence is that if you tell everybody it's only going to last <i>one</i> day, what's stopping the ""criminals"" from just taking a day off and hitting the streets the next day?"
The result of a drowning person without a life preserver.
All he do is throw insults. So childish! Is this what we want to be president? NO!!!
Im looking at this Senile Billionaire and thinking... Imagine if any other Former U.S President like  President Obama got on the United States Presidential Podium and said HALF the things this lunatic says AND be able to get away with it. Like honestly. Can you imagine? Because i Cannot 😵‍💫🫣😳🤯
The worst thing is that everyone cheers for him and themselves are horrible people too
There is something wrong with Kamala? There is a lot wrong with you Sir!
"Did I miss something here?  Every white person in the US is an immigrant, and not very nice immigrants, if you check history."
LIARS FOR KAMALA HARRIS
"I love how they have to connect the dots to how something is racist....if its soooo high altitude racism that it takes two white eggheads with himmler and tojo glasses to decipher, then why is everybody worried about stupid Trump supporters? I was expecting a black joke, this was neurosurgery meets monty python and if either one of these bald mofos has a pitbull skull shaver, they should be immediately cancelled because the guy that sells them on the commercials makes fun of foreigners with bad accents....which is funny, meaning its probably also racist."
Im hispanic and Donald Trump is right!  Close the borders!! WHY HAVENT SHE!!??? He is not racist. He is on point!!!
If anybody else spoke like this in public they'd be having a. 72 hour involuntarily mental health evaluation at the local hospital. Followed by a long term stay there & some <b>SERIOUS</b> amounts of medication.
The Purge is the wrong reference. Trump was calling for an American Kristallnacht. He is calling for police and paramilitary thugs to target immigrants and his political opponents.
"I like Hogan but Maryland needs that Senate seat or Dems lose their majority. Hogan needs to lose, because at the end of the day, he’s still a Republican."
People and believe in Donald Trump watch the news
"Tom Emmer, is a clown,  he can joinn Trump in Prision. for what he is doing"
"Poor Donnie he is scared of a fly,  you poor boy, Donnie"
"And when you think about it Donnie, everybody knows threre is something missing.  YOUR BRAIN.  Yes we will prosucte the people that cheated in the last election.  10 to 20 yrs in prision for you Donnie"
Lindsey Graham the comedian
"LOL.  MSNBC calling Trump out for him saying Harris is stupid.  Being called stupid is NOTHING compared to MSNBC calling Trump a racist, fascist, dictator, Hitler, bla bla bla.  Save your croc tears MSNBC, Harris IS stupid relatively speaking.  She doesn't have the experience, the maturity, or the intelligence to lead a country.  And more shocking and the bigger story should be the port workers about to go on strike and Biden has proclaimed ""hands off"".  What would Harris say or do?  Answer:  What ever is in the worst interest of the American people.  Facts are facts, but when you have MSNBC et al making excuses for them, facts are no longer facts, they're propaganda."
What does that have to do with the state of the country?  Trump has been called worse.
"I am voting for Trump and I actually disagree with him on this.  She's not mentally impaired, and there's nothing wrong with her brain.  She's just let evil take over her soul."
donOld tRump is troubled
It’s just so sick that all these sycophants clap for this filth and nonsense. Cult. Pure and simple.
"He wants to scare people into abandoning Harris, he is trying to use a fear mongering wedge to divide people into supporters and non and stir up chaos. He is a very, very dangerous human being because he lacks any empathy. He only cares about himself and winning. That's it. Very sad."
He is getting desperate
"The fly is headed towards the stuff coming out his mouth. This is the new GOP, better known now as the delusion, racist, MAGA crew."
We need to vote and make sure this animal does not win. He will destroy this country.
"Trump is now publicly saying the we need a day or two of ""marshal law"" in the USA....... evidently to make trump a dictator.....This is what the GOP has become..... the extreme far right wing trump for dictator party."
There are no words!!🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈 !!! How someone who speaks like him  could be elevated to the highest government position in the land is as inexplicable as the formation of the universe.
Two rich white folks calling another one racist?
36 days and then TRUTH !
"I don't think the media caught what Trump was saying about the fly, but his supporters did. He was suggesting that the influx of immigrants was responsible. He was comparing them to garbage."
What the heck is this man talking about!!?? It seems like he's got to make Harris out to be a babbling mentally disabled person just to make himself look smart? It doesn't work. It makes him look like a bigger ignorant man than Harris being disabled. She's a highly intelligent woman who will always mop the floor with trump
Mertz Extensions
Calling a woman stupid is nothing new to Trump .He’s the P Diddy of maga republicans the more he screws them the more they like it.Hitler is alive and well.
A mad man talking crazies 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Trump campaigns using hatred and lies. Typical Trump propaganda. He also blames others for everything. Remember his grandfather was once an immigrant. Funny how that goes.
sad sad
Ok hitler.
"And yet, his crowds still applaud him. Is there any sign at all that his apparent mental breakdown is undermining his support? He once said that he could shoot someone in the middle of the street. Maybe he was right.<br>For the record, as a life long resident of Atlanta, I can report that it is a peaceful fully functioning city that is not ""falling apart."""
Trump for president!!!!
"Watching on from Europe, it's extremely disturbing to witness the actual level of support for this hateful, self serving, power hungry bigot. The world knows Trump, we expect the vile hatred he spews daily, but to see that seemingly half the nation truly support him is just so shocking. When they hear the absolute hate, lies & divisiveness from him & they sit & cheer him on?? They're not cheering on his policies, they're cheering on his hate. Its disturbing & extremely worrying. Trump can be voted out, but all his hate filled followers will still be there baying for blood. What then?"
these two talking heads said biden is sharp as a tack and is the best version of him. why do ppl this watch this crap
"That we have to/choose to devote so much time, attention, energy to this unending stream of toxicity... is disturbing. We're in a double bind: because if we don't --? It might be far worse... On the other hand, we keep feeding his insatiable ego and humanity's addiction to Drama."
That's right<br>Keep trump alive<br>Keep trump in the daily news <br><br>The american media is responsible for creating this despicable character
"man, oh man, he is deranged."
Who are the people Trump believes are ready to do violence for him? Shouldn't we know?
I have to agree he should have used not competent. I believe calling him a racist is pretty nsultimg too. He has<br>Cheating in elections should be a crime I agree.<br>When crine is so bad a hard hand is needed this is how it works.<br>Illegal migrants should not be welcomed...do you think borders are there for maps. <br>I'm not 100% white but going on and on and on about race is racist in my opinion.<br><br>Btw talking about Haitian migtants is racist? Talking about Venezuelan gamgs that ate illegal migrants is racist? <br>You guys have no idea what these gangs can do. Cut your throat yeah easily. They shot people in the head for shoes ..
So Biden supports the collective bargaining in Yemen? Sharp as a tack alright.
Thank you for exposing this madman nt able to lose a debate. What will he do to us as President? The harm will also be to the people laughing at his talk of violence. Now he is threatening violence to the decent people.
It’s beyond crazy how this guy still has support
Why can't he pronounce her name correctly? You don't place stress on the second syllable. Simple.
"Trump is weird, he is an insurrectionist, not a candidate"
There is something wrong with Trump and apparently some Americans.  Don't let him cheat and bully himself into the Whitehouse again.  You will never get him out.
"Harris is NOT mentally impaired. She did NO high crimes. There's nothing ""missing."" Certainly not ""stupid."" We DO know that Trump cheated and lied on the last elections. Trump is S---. What does he mean by ""one rough hour?"" That sounds illegal. Also, new immigrants must learn English in school. So what. They learn."
Scarry... He is such a nazy!!!
I'm starting to think Trump is campaigning for Kamala.
This guy is a embarrassment to the US! Enough is enough!
So what else is new. Vote Blue.
Trump belongs in prison
👉  Do not allow your children to watch or listen to Trump. His racist behavior and language can harm your children.
"Narcissists DEFLECT. He can’t face that he is mentally impaired, stup!d, and a cheater and so he calls his opponent those names instead. This is psychology 101"
"If suggesting an open police rampage on US citizens isn't disqualifying for the office, I don't know what is.  Once again his cohorts are lying and saying he was saying this in jest."
Do you guys actually follow and believe what these new channel talking heads are telling us?
"The Purge is suppose to be a horror movie, not a Republican talking point."
Haitians speak English
I don't see or hear Trump doing this. MSNBC are liars!
"The stupid Republican Party, are stupid enough, to allow stupid, anywhere near them, again,  serves themselves right.."
I've said it time and time again trump is a totally classless individual.
"Cong. Emmer thinks that Trump should stick to ""Issues""?  There are three reasons he doesn't.  <br>1.  He doesn't actually know anything about ""the issues,"" except those that might pertain to him personally, like tax cuts for the rich.  Otherwise, he wouldn't talk about anything but very targeted tariffs, not slapping them on all imports.<br>2.  He's too lazy to care or find out about the issues, so when he came up with the idea of what to do when he is miffed about the leader of another country (everything is personal to Trump), he's just looking for a simple way to punish that leader.  You can bet there will be exemptions for imports from Hungary and Turkey, for example.<br>3.  Since Emmer is helping Vance prepare for the debate and Buttigieg is helping Walz, how about the two of them have a debate too?  Emmer, and every Republican, knows that they cannot win on the issues.  When you leave out the racism and authoritarianism, Republicans know that they are one-trick ponies, and that, flawed as they might be, Democratic programs and proposals are popular, and theirs aren't, i.e. Republicans, since 1932, have almost never been able to win in Congress on the issues.  When Republicans did win on ""trickle-down economics,"" how many voters actually believed that rich people would use the windfall they received from Republican tax cuts to benefit workers as much as themselves, and how many voted Republican just to change, to anything else, from Democrats?<br><br>These are the reasons Trump makes completely vague statements about ""the issues"" using the adjectives of a six-year old ( <i>great, terrible, wonderful, fantastic, awful, horrible</i> ) instead of giving the voters details.  So, according to him, crime will disappear if we just allow the police to ""get tough"" for one day, for one hour, and act like thugs, mob enforcers, instead of encouraging them to be positive role models for our children.  Respecting respectable police officers is not necessary.  Only fearing them is.<br><br>That's life in an authoritarian state with one ethnic or religious group dominating another and finding brutal ways to keep them in their place.  It's not like this is an original idea with Trump."
Make AMERICA affordable again! Under trump Poverty rates for African Americans and Hispanic Americans reached record lows.<br>		The bottom 50 percent of American households saw a 40 percent increase in net worth.<br>		Wages rose fastest for low-income and blue collar workers – a 16 percent pay increase.<br>		African American homeownership increased from 41.7 percent to 46.4 percent.
Msnbc talking about reporting bias is RICH
"No, the Haitians, in Springfield Ohio, speak two languages, dumpy, they speak French and English."
"The only one caught cheating was you, fake electors, January 6th!"
What a strange couple.....Liberals are SO creepy!!
I will be Voting Blue down the Ballot here 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
Won’t be long before he declares that anyone who votes for Kamala Harris is a traitor and must be prosecuted.
"RUN from trump cult supporters. They are the  EXCRUCIATINGLY IGNORANT people; the ones he laughs at in safety behind closed doors at his Mar A Lago club, because he knows they can NEVER AFFORD to enter his club. He'd NEVER allow it. It's why he preaches tax breaks for the rich instead of the rest of us. He wants ONLY THEIR VOTE; NO OTHER ASSOCIATION WITH THEM."
MSNBC can you focus on Trump Russia collusion and what about the dossier?
"It's scary that he's already laying the groundwork for another January 6.  On one hand, I think maybe some of his followers won't be dumb enough to do it again, and risk losing years of their lives in prison for a man who could care less about them, but on the other hand I think maybe they will just know how to do it more effectively this time? For the sake of the country, hopefully it's the former, but I'm not getting my hopes up"
"I would put all of my money on the fact this country would be better and less divisive without Donald Trump. I have zero doubt once Donald Trump is no longer in every single headline of every single mainstream media news outlet, and YouTube video title we the people will finally be able to put down our phones and care less about attacking one another and more about living our lives the way we did before and the way we will when he’s finally gone. End MAGA now.."
Every time Harris opens her mouth she proves just how stupid she really is!
"This man has overstepped the mark, and he is now nothing more than a raving racist who can never be allowed in the President's Office.  He can save his many lies to amuse his fellow inmates with until his dying days.  It is an utter disgrace that he has been allowed to get as far as he has got. The crowds who cheer at his vile comments should be utterly ashamed of themselves for so doing."
This cant be top news of the day
"Fake news to the rescue. You claim racism, the. Show a bunch of clips out of context. None being racist. You are not trust worthy."
Current administration sent more money overseas than they did to help hurricane victims.  <br>LGBT for president trump
Such a pos...LYING LIAR
"""They're letting the flies in! It's out of control, flies everywhere!  Emptying fly prisons, bringing them in from all over the world!  Have you seen these flies?!  They're as big as birds!  It's like the movie 'The Birds', but flies! The biggest, worst flies you've ever seen!  They're eating people's gardens, eating people's pets, they're eating the people!  The flies are eating the people!"""
Trump is projecting again!
Did he just suggest a one hour purge? Good god.
"Trump is a coward from way back, the coward who lied to avoid military service to his country, the coward who refused to fight the real communists in Vietnam, the coward who denied that he lost the election and started an insurrection at the capital in 2020. Trump is a coward, that’s all he is!"
"All these headlines should read:  ""Dump says something stupid again to get people talking about him."""
Disgusting the people cheering for him.
He is a sick old man.
Somebody change his diaper only crap is coming out of his piehole
"they applaud, but then complain about name calling --"
Trump should be arrested and jailed ....
"There's a common notion that everything Trump says is either projection or confession. ""Mentally unstable, a stupid person, cheating in elections, should be prosecuted"" Ya that makes sense!"
Trump is only the face of a bigger problem in America. The fact that a little less than half of our electorate thinks that he’s the better option for president. Our country would have to be shaken to the core in order to fix that problem.
"""I wonder where the fly came from?"" - It came from his dirty diaper."
How can anyone like him be running for president of the U.S.?
"The people who laught at, applaud and support Trumps ignorance are worst than he is."
"So basically Trump just said in his own way that the black people in Detroit , Atlanta and Philadelphia always cheat .."
"He repeats the same negative, racist, and hateful things in every speech because he hopes you will eventually believe his words. If he wins this election and you aren't a billionaire, he will turn on you. Vote with the mindset that your life is at stake, which it is."
Fake news media
he talks like a special needs child.
He’s an odd one to call someone else mentally disabled.
"MSNBC - Stop giving him a platform to spew lies !!!!!!!!! Ok.. state what he said, but stop putting that hateful, dangerous man's videos on your network!! YOU KNOW HE DEFLECTS - Over & over again. Who has personality mental disorders?  Trump. Who cheats before, during & after elections? Trump. Who lies uncontrollably, pathologically? Trump Who creates havoc, hatred, divide & is a warmonger? Trump. <br><br>He spews what HE is. <br><br>Please get that old criminal off your airways before he causes the true mentally (like him) to target Vice president Harris. Our country needs her SAFE"
Are Americans sure that thrump is not demented?
"Kamala is an admitted marxist that has the ethos to destroy the American capitalist economy. Wake up, America. She must be fired!"
Insane asylum is next for the orange clown.
"Those people are there because Trump validates the bigotry, malice and vilness that lurks in their souls, Trump has liberated them to be without restrictions  what they really are"
Trump is clearly stressed and like most narcissist when they are exposed it's not going to end well. Trump would love civil war if he doesn't get what he wants.
Su nariz es más grande que Pinocho y su lengua más grande también racista
This is why they don't history in our schools. GOP is writing their history.
Kamala makes George W. look like a genius
Calling out incompetence doesn't equate to racism!
It is like picking through a huge garbage bin of the most vile rubbish .. never ending and futile.
Trump is the one that's mentally impaired ! He has no respect and no decency !!!! He's one of the stupidest man Iv'e ever seen ! Trump should be arrested and jailed ! PERIOD !
"Harris the border zar, what a joke. Couldn't even do her one job as vice president.the only way any illegals like is because she don't care about the United States or the law.all she's good at is laughing"
I wonder how many people in the crowd only possess a GED or high school diploma? This is just getting ridiculous
"People at his rallies sit there and don't pay attention until Trump says something insulting or nasty- then they cheer. That's what they are there for. Remember, THEY ARE THE PARTY OF FAMILY VALUES."
Sickening
MSNBC why no coverage on the huge numbers of missing children that entered the United States without relatives or parents that are now lost- or missing? No pictures?
I agree...MIGRANTS have more right to American soil then people born in USA.  Cede power and opportunities to all newcomers.  Commie'ala says that we deserve opportunity economy....SHE MEANS OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOREIGN BORN PEOPLE.
All nonsense only going to get some people killed how can people believe in that
Sounds like he's planning a second Kristallnacht.
"Why in 2020 when he was a president, he did nothing about preventing ""unfair election""? Why if it were unfair, he would run anyway and up to now? BECAUSE IT IS NOT UNFAIR AT ALL. He just has a big mouth. He is an excellent example of a sore loser!!!"
"I want him to be president but the insulting has to stop, it’s not helping his campaign"
He is mentally unhinged.  I just don't understand how anyone with any common sense could possibly back him.
"Until now, he just does not have the mental capacity or ability to learn how to pronounce Kamala properly… All the ranting and lying is a disgrace.. By the way Trump, can you speak the language of the native Americans who lived in the country long before you and your family arrived?"
He is totally NUTS lock him up!!!!!
How disgusting can an individual be? Makes fun of people who suffer from some form of a disabilities.
<b>**so we know hes going to have a problem with these states:Detroit=Michigan Philadelphia =Pennsylvania Atlanta+Georgia Thats the groundwork he's laying so no one wonders what the problem is when he has it so here's the prediction **</b>
Donald Shortdick Trump
"I will never forgive or forget those who helped this clown take a second stab at staining America. Not really cool with those who bought into his first run either, but many came to their senses."
the greatest projection of all time!!!
Someone please cap this pos trump
I didn’t hear anything racist in this short clip.
They always catch the craziest pictures
A cheater calling others cheaters
"Lets see, you guys said Biden wasn't impaired, you hide that, and most people don't just watch this news and see for themselves. And worse things were said about Trump by the Democrats. We now found she lied by investigating her birth records. The black grandmother she claimed in a photo with her must have been the help. Then her middle class childhood home is now valued at 18 million."
Clearly shows who is in mental health crisis a pure lunatic
"The fly knows Art history. <br>Trump knows what the fly's presence means. <br>We may not have even noticed the fly. <br>But he is thinking so much about the fly, his words in his own head are so loud, he must speak like a predatory stranger you meet who says ""Don't worry, you can trust me."" <br>When he spoke recently to ""All women"" saying ""I will protect you,"" he was showing you that he is a predator trying to talk you out of your own intuition about him. <br>He had to say it. <br>Because he was thinking of the harm he will do. <br>And the evil voices are so loud in his own head.<br>Reference: <br>The Gift of Fear <br>by Gavin de Becker"
Mentally impaired?  A stupid person?Hey stumpy she's better educated than you.  <br><br>Madam VP Harris needs to sue him and the GOP for defimation of character.
It'll get worse as he begins to realise he's going to lose.  Scary part?  I believe between now and Jan 6th there will be violence.
"Trump is a Con man he is full of BS and does not know how to tell the truth. And regarding the economy and the check that he send out another con he put his name on it and the people think he send it personally it, it was Congress that passed it by the people. He inherited a good economy and when he left it was a total mess."
Kamala is so mentally impaired but she can tell who are Americas friends & who are its enemies.
Donald J. Trump should be very careful of what lies he is saying because he is the biggest cheater of all time and if God did come down to referry this election then the first thing that would happen is a lightning bolt striking the liar Donald J. Trump to ashes for his sins!!!😎🤓🥸🤠👨‍🎓👩‍🎓
Quit stop <br><br>Quit w the bias and conclusions. <br><br>Run the clips and let us decide. We can think. Stop telling us what to think. <br><br>And this from one who opposes Trump
"""Rome is the mob. Conjure magic for them and they'll be distracted. Take away their freedom and still they'll roar. The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the senate, it's the sand of the coliseum.""  Trump won't be around much longer.  But MAGA will.  The hatred, xenophobia, racism, bigotry and misogyny lives on.  And lives on in our neighborhoods, our schools, our government, and for many of us, in our own families."
"Wow just a Trump feast and nothing about Biden and Harris doing anything about the Hurricaine. Who cares what Trump says, their actions show that they don't care about Americans."
Joe knows how to blow
This man IS INSANE. He speaks nothing about POLICIES.
"Trump is a master “projectionist”…that’s right, keep calling her names, saying she’s stupid, she’s a facist, etc. Let’s see what happens after the  election."
Donald Trump is probably the worst human being on the planet right now.
"Does America really want someone as vile as this running their Government?   Thought the whole idea of a democratically elected Head of State was to have some one Of the People, Voted in by the People and working for and on behalf of the People."
Scary thought that these are swing state voters.
Harris is Indian
"If what the criminal con man Donald J. Trump is saying was true about Republicans then he would be doing life in prison.This Fascist lying Nazri is the worst criminal in politics today, lets stand up to this lying fraudster Donald J. Trump by voting for Harris and Walz in November 2024!!!😎🤓🥸🤠👨‍🎓👩‍🎓"
calling for kristallnacht
They talk like they don't insult and smear people all the time.
"When Kamala announced her candidacy, I guessed she would get 65% of the popular vote. Let's wait and see how close I am."
"Trump has learned from the mistakes of Jim Jones.<br>America is in dire straights, listen to the cultists cheering and applauding this despot."
Bizarre !!
"As a disabled veteran, he insults me in ALL ways."
Man i can hardly wait to see the last of this guy.
The moment Trumps Invisible Piano Accordion comes out<br><br>….you know Trump is lying.
He's got the weird hair....He's only missing the stupid little moustache.
What a child
Trump=Hitler
I absolutely HATE Donald Trump!  What a horrible person!  He’s the worst!
Certifiably insane
Talk about mentally deficient. Trump is the new definition.
Trump for blacks 2024🎉
"Just by understanding 1 Corinthians 5:11verse alone,  Not even a single person 🧍🏾 in the entire world 🌎 should ever listen 👂 to a very dishonest person, trump. A con man with delusional disorder."
As usual he is PROJECTING his own stupidity on others... We know that... Everyone knows that---as he would say it himself...
That fly 🪰is buzzing around him because it smells a big blob of 💩. Flys like 💩🤷🏾‍♂️.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao-Dsq5OJTA&t=420"">7:00</a> This is why I like the Lincoln Project,  you can't credit any statement made by Trump as being intelligent."
It’s KAMala. Is he too rude or just too stupid to learn that?
Way too much footage of DJT at once (he's just painful) but THANKS for a good analysis.
Vote him out for good. Save the country Vote Blue 💙 🇺🇸
Absolutely everything Trump says as a claim against Dems is what he is doing himself.   The guy is crazy nuts and not worth one vote let alone millions.
"""hey trump , instant kamala's gonna get you"""
What we need is less coverage of the crazy person and MORE SOLUTIONS CONCERNING HOW TO STOP THIS.  DO NOT KEEP REPEATING HIS RHETORIC WITH NO COMMENTARY ON HOW FASCIST IT IS.
Ttump talks about himself as always. He lost the debate to a mentally disabled person 😂😂
TRUMP IS THE MOST RACIST PRESIDENT IN MODERN DAY AMERICAN HISTORY
"It's actually pretty funny to watch Trump act like a raging lunatic, using rudimentary personal attacks against his political opponent. He thinks because he gets so triggered when people make fun of him, that everyone goes off the deep end like he does. He tried to do it in the debate and she laughed in his face. It's been like 3 weeks and he still can't stop talking about it. He's nearly 80 years old and he's still using insults that kids use against each other on the playground."
Trump equals jail time
There are the most despicable vile words. Until tomorrow when he says even worse things. 💙💙💙💙💙
Trump is trying to get his base to act out in violence!!!!
The said thing about that is those who need to listen is not listening
Is trump trying not to win?
You tried to cheat but you were denied!<br>Revisionist history!
"Trump survived 2 assassination attempts within a month by a non black,Haitian or Latin individual nore were they immigrants and still spews racist hateful violent redderct to those communities everyday"
"So disapointing from trump when you think of the great Presidents of the past, the great leaders.Harris is closer than trump by a mile on Leadership."
"Trump is so scared of Kamala Harris. He's like a 5th grade bully, calling her names when she's not around. And his crowd is like 5th graders egging him on with their applause. How old is he? Who sounds mentally incompetent now?"
No wonder this guy keeps getting shot at . 😢 the bots are crazy
"We know trumps going to be the worst possible president, he’s going to promote extremism, nationalism and corruption again. Some people think he’ll be best for the economy so please speak truth in public forums, donate and vote and help your friends and family vote. This election will impact our lives and lives around the world for a long time to come"
This is such a truely DISPICABLE man
KAMALA HARRIS SAID FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO SAY IT TO HER FACE. AND HE DID! HE CALLED HER A MARXIST TO HER FACE AT 1ST DEBATE. HILARIOUS!
"A viral photo from the Michigan vs. Minnesota college football game shows Minnesota Governor ""Tampon Tim"" Walz giving the middle finger to the crowd after a fans shouted ""Trump for 2024."""
“If God came down from a high…” 😅
😢president trump in georgia help out with supplies a talking to agenties musk. Is helping out wheres biden and harris.long shoremen strick looming wheres biden and harris
"Yeah, we’re going to prosecute. If people try to interfere with election maybe you should think about that Trump you and your little Megas who are already trying to take away peoples votes in certain states maybe you should think about that you’re already out for prosecution for the last election And keep going away you’re going you’re gonna be up for prosecution again for this election and nothing is going to save you from that because you were not president this time so there are no laws to protect you.. you’re a weirdo you’re old and decrepit and frankly senile"
Sick. Disgusting!
"These are outright threats!  Why does Trump get away with this.  Any other person who vows to seek retribution, pain, and death on others would be silenced.  It is at least slanderous.  Why does he get away with it???  Anyone who attends his rallies and applauds his slanderous lies is guilty of the same lies."
Give it to him back to back Kamala  . Don't let him intimidate you. Iron sharpeneth Iron. Send grandpa back to Florida
"Please, the trace not out of control. I’m from Detroit. Our city is doing actually quite awesome. We are a bunch of friendly people are crime is down and one of the most visited cities in the country right now and he thinks for one minute he’s gonna cause chaos in Detroit, we will press charges against him for it so advance. Be careful what kind of lies they put out in the public because Detroit Michigan will prosecute you. You’re not gonna do Detroit Springfield Ohio especially somebody convicted of 34 felons and sexually assaulted a woman gonna sit there and say Detroit is a bad place because it’s far from your lies are bad your lies harm and frankly what you say about Harris that’s more you that it is Harris that’s how you act that’s how you behave your radical. Your words are dangerous and you should never be near the White House or any nuclear codes…"
T-rump definitely fits the title-- WEIRD.....this guy is just WEIRD!!!....sick! sick! sick!
Omg how can no one see what I see DICTATOR.  <br><br>Is this a 15 year old speaking?????
The Republicans are cowerds
HE STILL HAS HIS OVERSEERS BL FOR CHUMP..
"DonOLD who married TWO immigrants who gave him 4 anchor babies.  Trump supporters wearing the red hats, some with their I.Q. on them."
"Any place where Trump is not leading in the polls is out of control. No, sir, you are out of control. Wake up, America!"
"I can’t understand how these trump supporters sit, listen, and cheer trump who is a well-known racist and his racism is clearly shown in everything trump says and does.  I can’t believe his majority white audience does not understand or see that trump is preaching nothing but pure hate, revenge, social unrest and division, yet the crowd just eats it up."
"There's something wrong with Trump. I don't know what it is, but everyone knows it."
"2016 he outted the phoney televangelist, Now he's outting the Real Racist. I'd rather know who they are than not know."
"Boy, those Christian values sure do pour off him, don't they!"
He is so foul. Aren’t yall tired of hearing his disrespect. Just hate and racism.
Cocaine is a helluva drug!!
Maybe you guys in America should invest in education... this orange guy is completley crazy and the half of your population is clapping for him..... 😱 Please vote him to the trash of history. It´s about time!
"Trump is the ‘King of Insults’. We wait in much anticipation, for him to be humiliated via a democratic process … the ballot box."
He screems her name out in the middle of the night she 😊kicked his A-- so bad .
"You know, it is a shame that people cheer and applaud for him when he says these horrible  thing."
Where is the piece of s*** vice president during the hurricanes?
he's OUT OF CONTROL!
Trump is showing signs of somebody losing an election
He even use words of God bit he himself doesn't even know to pray
Vote for trump
"this is said by a man that tried to steele the last election.this guy is a lying fool,and is not fit to be the president of our country"
SICK MAN!
Just put on the white hood already Trump hahaha... 😂
You are out of control and how dare you even say Gods name
What the hick he is seeing
"Joe, don't try to explain the actions and words of someone who has gone off the rails."
This man has no morals whatsoever and anyone that votes for him or even likes him you honestly have no morals or anything about you either
Stoking great replacement white fears; rallying cry. Giving permission to act on their hate. Haitian immigrants in Ohio pulled down the curtain.<br>Not all Trump supporters are racists; but all racists are Trump supporters. Complicity is just a bad.
"I’ve been travelling in Europe, and every one of the many Americans that I have met is deeply embarrassed, ashamed. He is hated."
Most blue areas on the policial map are in the major cities where the uneducated live and have low IQS thats a fact the red areas are in the suburbs and rurualaresa
"Problem is, I tend to support Republican policy.  Sadly, there is none, not anymore.  All of this BS rhetoric...  I stopped voting Republican in 2015.  I'm not a Democrat, but I have morals.  I cannot, in good conscious, support this man.  I pray for the sanity of the GOP.  Better or worse, our country needs different parties with varying viewpoints.  It's how to stay centric.  This is not the answer.  Please, ""sir,"" STOP!  GO AWAY!"
"In 5 of these clips, he was reading off the teleprompter (including all the ones talking about his opponent being mentally impaired)."
"Only a candidate without a track record of success in office, and no plan to work on behalf of the American people, would campaign using personal insults, racism, threats of retaliation towards people who criticize or disagree with him.  His threats of violence are unacceptable.  He has no honest criticism of Harris so he has to resort to this.  Pathetic."
I always wondered how Germany could’ve possibly elected a guy like Hitler……..After seeing Trump I get it now……
And he wonders why people are shooting at him
"The worst man alive. TBH, worse than ISIS, because at least I *understand how those people stayed horrible. He had every advantage (except loving parents) and turned into this parody of human flesh."
As an Australian watching you guys from overseas this is honestly so entertaining. If Trump wins it would be so hilarious.
PLEASE !!!!!Vote blue 💙 💙💙💙💙💙
"When he talks about Dems replace the word ""Cheating"" with the word ""Winning"" and you get what he is saying."
He’s so disgusting!
Harris saids strike is not a concern thats a real leader that dont care about the impact on consumers
He needs medical and psychiatric attention asap. He is desperate and the closer it gets to Election Day it’s only going to get worse and he’s only going to incite more violence and bold about his racism. The crowd that applauds him is such a disappointment. It’s sad to know there’s people out there who support his BS.
"Harris is such a JOKE!!  $525 billion to Ukraine, $750 billion to illegals and $700.00 for Maui families, that’s Kamala Harris America! Liberals are so ignorant and misguided"
"“I am the least racist person there is anywhere in the world!”<br>Yeah, you're as ""least racist"" as Hannibal Lecter is a ""real"" person."
"Trump's bitter because his wife married him for money. He has to pay for p*<b>*</b> Ever since he was younger, he had always had to pay for it pathetic."
Nothing stinks worse than frightened millionaire ‘news’ idiots afraid they will be in trouble when Trump wins. The stench is over powering with each successive lie blathered.
"Any kind of illegal but previously accepted level of cheater, you better run for the hills pal."
What an evil and hateful person.
"Was he looking in the mirror when talk about Kamala? What an evil, unintelligent person he is and has been. Speaking of speaking English, he’s not even good at speaking the language."
Best part of it all is i heard more clapping at my sons 5th grade graduation
His hair is purple now instead of orange
What´s new? Dirty Donald being dirty Donald again.
INVASION OF FLIES!!!
"You say a whole lot of misinformation.   She cheated on the last debate.  Trump will win.   The masses see how incredibly messed up the Kamala, tampon Tim is.   They want every American to fall."
Trump needs to go after the Republicans because they are the ones CHEATING !!!
Pretty rich that Trump decries anyone for not speaking English. He speaks BOLLOCKS every time he opens his flappy insane mouth.
When Trump says the Democrats are cheating he's basically saying we're cheating but going to blame them
How people defend Trump is beyond me.
How can any one with even an ounce of intelligence support this buffoon. ?
Does Trump go to the stage after getting drunk. I can’t believe this is  America
The Orange one is losing it <br> 🎃
Listening to this man makes me very literally feel sick to my stomach. How can anyone be cheering for this? Make it make sense.
They are not so stupid??😂
Why are we subjected to clips of this waste of oxygen?  Can't you just report on what was said?
Trump is a fraud. I bet all of his supporters have been scammed easy. Because they're being scammed right now
Someone should change his diaper it stinks again
"Why is Donald's hair purple? Did he come out? You are right Donald, there is something missing in Kamala that you have more of than almost anyone in history, and that is ignorance."
every where thats not all white is a problem and cheating according to trump
Trump is the only person that has been able to make the right show their true side
Liar  DJT... CRAZY FOLLOWERS
"Watching the campaign from the UK and totally supporting the Harris/Walz ticket not only am i horrified by Trumps racist rhetoric but I am simply astounded by real Republicans not coming out in greater numbers to denounce Trump and his MAGA followers. It needs the grand old Statesmen and women to make more effort to stop the destruction of the GOP. How Trump gained the party’s nomination as THEIR candidate is beyond me. Thank God living this side of the pond I don’t have to face the consequences when Trump loses. He will never accept defeat due to his mental capacity however big the Harris/Walz majority is! You are voting to save not only The Constitution and your Democracy but also the freedom of mankind around the globe. Trump doesn’t just need sentencing he needs gagging, a straight jacket and a padded cell sooner rather than later. Serious times ahead I fear. Vote Blue in massive numbers on November 5th to give hope for a safer future and freedom at home and abroad. The UK stands with a Democratic United States of America💙💙"
5 weeks and this foolishness goes to prison for life and his victims will get paid off
This poor man...
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao-Dsq5OJTA&t=117"">1:57</a> calling Harris stupid as he attempts the difficult feat of putting a piece of paper into his pocket."
"Children in the schools can't speak English? In that case, during some of the daytime, they should be taken to a place that provides some sort of education."
The media has normalized trumps behavior.
Where is the evidence behind your Claims Donald Trump???
5 weeks before people are going to die because of the media
Trump is such a lowlife!!!
Trump is Evil.  I pray he loses the election because Trump is very sick mentally.  He projects all his sins on to others.  If you want an end of chaos and violent rhetoric vote for Kamala.
"This is all he has? He is going to lose so badly with this. So old, so tired."
Joe Scarborough is a clown 🤡
Mean
He is beyond mentally impaired.
"I am from the state of Wisconsin, and I am so Ashamed of my fellow Wisconsinites who are foolish enough to fall for the words of this Wannabe Dictator"
When is he getting arrested for defamation  of Haitians.
Trust me it's just gonna get worse and worse....with the last 2 weeks before the election he and the Russians will throw the kitchen sink at Kamala. Comey gave it to him last time...he will be looking for Comey II
I’m a Poll Worker in a swing state-that will ultimately decide the outcome of this election. I’m really disgusted with his rhetoric!! Trump has no idea what civic duty is. Why is this deplorable man still allowed to be the Republican candidate?? European leaders are questioning this- yet we’ve got people in this country supporting him?! That is almost as scary as Trump himself!!
Why trump isn’t talking about the crazy white man that tried to shoot him— because they weren’t non-white or immigrants.
"Lock him up now, those new threats. One rough hour on You Trump, done."
the dictator Mr. trump!
"I just vomited out my breakfast listening to these two. I would be very very happy if Trump won by a landslide and your ratings would drop so much that MSMBC would have no choice but fire you. People like you would never be invited to our house for dinner. After years of horrible personal attacks against Trump you have a nerve for complaining when he, Trump, pays you back with same. You two should get a real job and get your hands dirty and see how real people live. You are a good example of ""White privilege"" . I realize that this comment will be deleted but I feel better now that I got it of my chest."
So mudslinging does not exist anymore? Must be forgetting about political cartoons 😅
"Sounds true to me , from what I’ve seen."
at lease he speaks his mind. the current president can’t even speak
"Donnie, you are campaigning because otherwise you would be in jail. Not because dems cheat.<br>Vote people 💙💙💙💙💙"
Trump is such a racist it’s actually quite terrifying 😢
His own daughter said under oath she believed he lost. <br>And what's up with saying he's putting people in jail but saying Biden was the one that weaponized the justice department (so well he indicted his own son 😂)
"So unhinged, unstable and unfit."
Files are attracted to shi....
Files are attracted to shi....
Trump was born with a full diaper for a brain like all his followers.
Hey Trump u wanna put the death penalty on the list like u did for blk and Mexican teens who were innocent  ?
HE can't speak English!!!
Only “out of control” in states he lost in 2020???
Wouldn't know a stupid person if he looked in the mirror
The irony of calls to “enforce the laws” when fat Jan 6. Sentences are clearly working.  Those proud boys are acting like school children now!  I bet no one touches the Capitol this year!
Looks like Barney
Every. Accusation. Is. A. Confession.
He is beyond the pale
Evil Vile man  he's Projecting. Talking about himself.
The utter CRAP he was spewing from his mouth brought flies to hom
He’s got nothing left but extreme hatred. It’s just sad at this point 😢
why do you cover these idiotic speeches?
Could the Donald bring his college transcripts so that we can compare them to Kamala's?
Trump has never said anything negative about Indians. MSNBC has tried pushing the racist against blacks bs for so long now they are claiming it's against Indian women too. Because KAMALA AINT BLACK!!!
This may be the vilest person on the planet!
Misleading news!!<br>Your goal is to reach out people who does not research enough and distract Americans from pressing matters that the country faces!<br>Ban Mainstream Media!!
"""If god came down from a high"" 😂😂😂 But they propaganda paving the way for future violence is terrifying. Donald Hitler Trump."
Every Trump accusation is in reality of self-confession.
plain loser
Flies smell the Bull___.
It’s an embarrassment for the USA !
You just need to find someone with better a*m.
"Borders a mess, inflation is sky high, major conflicts in europe and the middle east <br><br>We can not have 4 more years of this- tim walz"
Trump is weird racist lying nut job...
The people who are supporting this hate and lunacy are absolutely DISGUSTING ! 💙Harris/Walz 2024
"When you have been sued by the City of New York for racial discrimination 120 time and lost every time,  Your a racist!"
Smart and intelligent people know he is projecting. Except his supporters.
MSNBC focused more on his character rather then what he can do.  Happy faces and love and humility does not lower inflation.
He's talking about himself
I still know people with Down that have more sense.
You can't fix stupidity
"America scares me on the level of the debate, this is so basic, low intelligence… low level arguments…in russia or china there is no debates… they must be laughing"
Hes out of control somebody get the net😂
"She was ""born that way""? Cue an endorsement from Lady Gaga."
Watching from England and hoping the American people do the right thing in November and that Trump rots his miserable life away in prison.Left wondering how he can have a base support at all .
"Whenever Trump resorts to racist and demeaning attacks against VP Harris, it's because he knows he's not at her level and has nothing to amount to her level of intelligence and experience. Trump was born with a silver spoon and supposedly went to the best schools money can afford, but still behaves as if he was in a jungle with no basic human training.<br><br>It's sad that the media is still trying to logically compare Trump's crazy antics against VP Harris's logical sense. America, you have two types of elections going on at the same time - one with hateful rhetoric and an unhinged candidate who wouldn't be allowed to travel to most countries, and the other with a highly qualified candidate who is ready for the task.<br><br>I don't even know why the race is still close; it's mind-blowing for some of us non-Americans observing from the outside. Trump is riding off his privilege, and it's encouraged by Republicans and MAGA supporters.<br><br>There's no way Americans would tolerate this kind of behavior from VP Harris. We all know black people, especially black women, are harshly judged by different standards in all sectors, including politics.<br><br>What happened to political candidates arguing on policies instead of racist attacks and lies? America is supposed to be the beacon of democracy, but it looks like this ship sailed when extreme right rhetoric became the norm.<br><br>You stayed silent when Trump started attacking President Obama with birtherism lies. You normalized insults when he bullied Hillary Clinton on a national stage, and nobody jumped to stop his behavior when he followed her on stage during the debate - behavior that would get someone fired in any company.<br><br>You give him more airtime to spit his lies when he lost in 2020 and still cover him when he taunts President Biden during his presidency for the last four years. The media, who are more focused on sensational news to sell, are equally complicit in Trump's unhinged behavior.<br><br>You bear the responsibility to not cover him as you do. The world is watching, America. Do something in November and vote blue with a landslide to erase any doubts.<br><br>Meet Trump, Republican lawmakers, and the MAGA movement with your vote, and show them divisive rhetoric and racism have no place in the world. All the different ethnic groups in America need to show him the door away from the Oval Office. The world is counting on you."
smooth brain clowns don't breed
"Oh Trump wants to go back and review the 2020 election does he? Is that the one where your side hired 18 “Fake Electors” to pretend that Donald Trump won who are now in various steps of the judicial process? Well maybe we should review that election, AND the one in 2016 where Donald Trump lost the popular vote, but still ended up as president anyway."
"That crowd supports his rhetoric because they agree with him.  They are bigoted, racist, Xenophobic, hate-filled people. They are not patriots. They don't care about this country. They are grotesque. His rhetoric is horrifying..it is disgusting..it is scary & so is Trump & what his followers support. We have to acknowledge it and fight against it with everything we have. We can not afford to get tired of fighting back. We can't look away. We have to confront this head on."
He’s starting to sound more and more like Jim Jones.
"Oh Trump wants to go back and review the 2020 election does he?

How foolish of me. To kid myself into believing that Trump had bottomed out. Yet he continues to find much sicker lows. He is going to his rallies looking half dead. Voice barely above a whisper. And yet falling further into madness. Very difficult to watch. Even sadder Is  his rhetoric is even more pathetic. He has nothing. And now all he can do is attack and insult Kamala Harris about things that are actually happening to him. His brain is much worse than a kindergarten child resorting to childish name calling. Scarey to watch the human brain diminish in such a manner. Can he lead our Nation. NO. But someone should lead him to where he can get help. He needs it Badly.
The left just doesn't get it! Maybe they should watch all the videos of grieving parents whose loved ones have become victims of immigrant crime! Or the angry residents of Chicago and other cities who see their precious public resources going to put up immigrants in fancy hotels!
"Daily reminder, Democrat controlled mainstream media is propaganda media.<br>Do not believe the people who spew Russia Russia Russia lies.<br>Trump 16, 20, 24"
Speaking like a guy who knows the embarrassing L is coming
MSNBC y’all need to be a shame of yourself you never said anything about Trump all you love is her and everyone know it … I will never watch y’all again
The part I don’t get is who cheers and wants to hear the president call someone stupid? The president used to get looked up to and highly respected and always held themselves to a certain standard. No matter which party. They were presidential. The fact the this clown attacks and insults to create division and so many people are cheering and proud is what scares me about what’s to come!!! Vote!! Vote!! Vote!! We won’t go back
North Carolina just got crushed by a hurricane. Since there not Ukraine Kamala goes to a L.A. fundraiser with elites. A glimpse of what a Kamala Presidency looks like
When will this madness ever end?!
I think he will get mad and mad and crazy as long as November 5th is approaching.. because he is very sad to suggest that he will loose against a woman something that he never anticipated.. maybe in January 6 2025 he will go crazy
And his zoombie followers applaud and celebrate. Unbelievable
"the clapping and cheering, seriously disturbing"
"It’s really sad to realize that there are tens of millions of Americans who are hateful, racist and ignorant. To believe obvious lies is about as stupid as you can get."
"Mentally impaired talking to mentally impaired !   What is going on over there, how can the be tied, has this country gone half crazy?  If Trump wins, the western world will split!"
Yikes. Stephen MIller is clearly writing his speeches.  This is really disgusting.
He's just repeating what others are saying about him trying to put it to Kamala.
"Donald Trump is so afraid to lose and that's why he is so out of controle crazy that the small  time that's still left till november 5 he obviously only wants to use his spare time with ranting, screaming and calling Kamala Harris nasty insiulting names ! <br>In short : by doing so he is only digging his own grave !"
Not immigrants but  illegal immigrants. Funny how that works.
"This crazy man is just saying anything that comes in his head. He don't know nothing about the schools in Springfield,  he's never been there."
This is no long political rivalry but it’s became a cult .. he will try and he will never succeed in politic
Sad. Really sad.
"Young people in Germany burnt books in public after Hitler won the election. I was watching a movie about that and felt how horrible it must have been to be “normal” at that time watching that happening and not being able to do anything to stop it. It’s sad that I’m living through something similar now. Never have I imagined that we get to live through it, too."
"Has he been watching The Purge? <br>At this point his mind is mush and he's scared. But he and his enablers have been hiding this fact for years by throwing it onto Biden. Even on his worst day, Biden makes more sense than this loser."
Evils are people<br>Who supports this guy
It's not racist to tell the truth. Why do dimocrats hate America so much that they want to import  millions of criminals and poor people? Easy!! Then they want an amnesty and then these people that have no idea how our country works can vote for free stuff the dimocrats promise.
What an azz-h__e !!!!!!
White jacket with long sleeves labeled Trump long overdue
He's a sick M'fr!!!!
recall that Trump wanted to execute the Central Park 5
He can not comprehend losing to a woman.
"Twenty days after the election, Trump will find himself incarcerated."
Domestic terrorism is criminal and treasonous ~<br>President Biden needs to exercise the core power and duty of his office to jail<br>trumpl$tilt$kin<br>and all of hi$ coconspirators !<br>the corrupt scotus decision made it a no brainer.<br>Vote 🟦 🇺🇸
He is Evil
"As a devout Democrat...............I want to hear Trump's plan............but I don't get it...........why not?  What does he mean when he calls people stupid, mentally impaired, etc.  I don't understand.  I would really like to know the logic behind his name calling.  There must be a logical reason.????????"
"Worst american in history. This country will remain ugly and a laughingstock even after he is imprisoned, because his sick messages still resonate with too many of this country's dumber half."
I guarantee that Trump's rhetoric is leading up to him calling Harris the N-word. Mark my words.
The boy who cried wolf is back. Do they not realize that one day they will need to tell people that someone is actually racist. And no one will care while they scream it is true this time!
How could anyone every consider voting for this deranged man.  He desperately needs to be institutionalize and get the serious help he needs.   Listening to these people cheering the liars and fear mongering he’s doing are just as impaired as he is and should seek mental help. VERY SCARY! VERY SCARY!
If God had the time to come down....He'd most likely strike Donny down with leprosy and make him eat grass for 14 years.
Trump is promising to prosecute cheaters on this election.<br><br>Merrick Garland!!!!! DO YOU HEAR THIS? 🎉🎉🎉🎉<br><br>Garland better be ready to do his job this time. Trying to ignore what Trump did in the last election until 2023 is why we are in the state we are in now.
"I decided to put Kamala's and Trump's plans side by side on every issue.<br>Trump is like ""We are gonna get rid of that bad thing and replace it with this wonderful plan that's beautiful and the most perfect solution in the history of our nation.""<br>Kamala is like, ""Here are our solutions, the data, the figures, and real examples of places where these policies have been enacted and their results. Also, here are the citations to credible resources that back up our claims""<br><br>THIS ELECTION IS NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!!!!!!<br><br>People, please read her 81-page economic policy plan...I love that she dropped the ""unrealized gains"" tax and wants to tackle weak supply chains that are the root cause of inflation."
This news channel is a disgrace… just report the news and shut up. Trump has my vote !!
TRUMP IS BEGINNING TO SOUND MORE AND MORE LIKE JIM JONES.
Trump is already meeting with Zelenskyy to end the war. If you truly value peace you'd vote trump.
Vote blue for women's rights
"Trump w melt down, he is weak racism is fear, fear nothing love all, please vote 👊🏽"
DonOLD was born morally-challenged.<br>Trump lies the way that most of us breathe in air.
Dolt45 has gone full-blown Adolph.
He is made possible by the enablers in office and his magat cult voters
And Republicans wonder why certain entities want/wanted to take him out…
"WHAT'S WRONG WITH HARRIS IS SHE IS SMARTER, A LOT SMARTER THAN TRUMP."
"Excuse me it’s Springfield, Ohio. Not Ohio Springfield, better give that brilliant brain some adderall, your brain is scattering again and again and again and again, etc."
I am not following US election politics and logged in after a while and this is quite disturbing. Since he came on stage in 2016 I have not seen good things. It is amazing that the republicans cannot find anyone better than TRump.
"Trump is a dark evil liar. He constantly projects. He is the one with a problem, malignant narcissist. He has unravelled. I look forward to him losing and being Away from the public. Vote Blue and vote for Kamala!"
"One of my step-sons, when he was a little boy about 5 yrs old, ....used to call things/people 'stupid' which he didn't like or understand.     Trump is lower than that level, with an added mean-streak."
"Every rally the hate is turned up more and more, it's at this point sounding more venomous than ever and it shows his heartlessness"
"Every Person Donal Trump names should sue him for slander.  By definition, it is a sure win every time."
Dear Lord how much longer this is going to go on I don't live in America and I am tired of him
"Hey peabrain Trump, try putting the photos of the thousands of USA born Americans guilty of those same crimes in the past year on the stage. <br>What a child Trump is."
I remember the fly that sat on top of Mike Pence head during his debate. Perhaps we'll see trump swallow one next.
"Who is everybody? He always says ""everybody knows it""!  He is standing there with purple hair,  so who's mentally unstable to run for president?"
Where is joyful caring we must come together Kamala ?for the US citizens devastated by these storms???
trump is losing...again....
The darkness is reaching out for the darkness.
Look into the mirror Donald J Trump😢
They can't put this monster in jail? What is going on in America.. Do we have Americans that want to give their freedoms up? It says a lot about this country 😢
"How can someone exhibit such vile & evil intent & still have support  in ""the land of the free, & the home of the brave""? Get rid of Trump."
"Violent day...did trump just promote a purge?!! <br>How is this guy allowed to even run. The worst thing about his whole political introduction is there will be others like him that will follow. Before, anyone who thought like him, talked like him, had convictions like him would never dare to run for any office; he has just normalized it for other horrid people to now follow."
You can smell the desperation seeping from his every pore....gross.
Mindless Trump Puppets. This just go”s to show how mentally unstable These mentally challenged people are that listens and Believes his rants.
"all projections. Everything he identifies as personality traits belonging to Harris, he exhibits in spades."
Poor poor man he is very very sick 😊😊😊😅aw😊
waiting for the racist remarks??? hello?
34 Felonies
Fake news same old garbage
STOP giving him prime time. You are enablers of reprehensible behavior.
demokkkrats lololol
"Those cheating DNC flies.  hehe.  This stupid country, hehe"
"Kamala is the axe in this Turkish proverb:<br><br> The forest was shrinking, but the trees kept voting for the axe; for the axe was clever and convinced the trees that because his handle was made of wood, he was one of them."
"If liberal viewers were smart and STOP voting by identity politics  they would  notice that Cnn, msnbc has nothing positive to say about Trump and all glory to kamala  who both sides reported that she was  the worst VP in history and now she is the best thing slice bread. They are pandering to you with empty promises! <br><br>Nevertheless, Kamala has no policies ans she recently stole Trump legislation promise to enact of No taxes on tips! She is a thief and fraud. Her voters are choosing her only on her gender and race. <br><br>Btw. Not all Jamaicans are Black. Her father is Asians and Irish Jamaican mix. <br><br>Vote Trump and bring back law and order, no identity politics, no racial division, no castration of children,  no men in women sports, lower inflation  so we can afford to buy a home again , food again, lower gas prices again, energy independent again ( we were almost there) and a stronger border and negotiations to end the proxy war we are in now."
Trump will become more extreme as he desprately glutches for power
Trump's grandfather was an immigrant-Wikipedia
TRUMP AGAIN FOR PRESIDENT 🇺🇸 2024!
"We all have problems from birth, even bone spurs"
"I am truly scared… My boyfriend is a daca recipient and I am really scared for him. He’s been in this country since he was three years old. He knows his country as his home. He’s college educated pay taxes here more than a lot of people more than Donald Trump did $750 ???not fair for a millionaire to pay less than someone who makes $50,000 a year that is just baffling to me."
One more month of his mouth.
Harris walz  vote
You can see how much Trump is hurting after being humiliated by Harris in their recent debate.  It's clearly eating him up every day. I wonder how much sleep he is getting?
"He is flat out insane. Calling someone mentally disabled who wiped the floor with him in a debate.  Stop him, Americans. Harris / Walz have to win in a landslide."
This Lunacy needs to end! How can anyone that backs this man sleep at night?
AMERICAS BIGGEST CRIMINAL Fraud finds out AMERICANS ARE SICK TO DEALTH OF HIM ! HIS WORDS ARE WORTHLESS !
Calling her stupid while she destroyed him in the debate is hilarious
Hillary and Maduro sitting in a tree...😂😂😂
"I'm starting to think Trump doesn't want to win the election anymore. He wants to lose, and use his supporter's revolt against it as an excuse for an uprising. If he wins there wont be enough destruction and mayhem for him."
"Trump is done, he has lost what's left of his small, feeble mind. He needs to go away now. VOTE BLUE DOWN BALLOT!"
Trump for Pressie!!! 🎉
"This guy has to lose if you’re not a billionaire and you vote for him, you’re voting against your own interests period"
Only sheep watch and believe this fake news propaganda
LOL HOW IS LAURA LOOMER DONALD?
There's a fly on the podium because they are drawn to rotting meat.
You democrats are losing it because you know you’re about to lose the election! 😂
Shut up already... the lips keep flapping nonsensical...<br>The fly came to land on 💩
Trump knows this works.<br><br>1. He has main/side media fully focused on every rubbish he spews while relegating news about Harris to fine print. <br><br>2. Ask the British how seemingly level headed people voted to exit the EU then started goggling “what is EU” after the referendum passed. It was mostly due to peddling fear. Fear of immigrants. Fear of people who don’t look like you. Fear that “those people” will take something away from you. <br><br>It works like magic and he knows it. That’s why he outsmarted us in 2016 and might just do so again. <br><br>What may save us this time is a stronger fear from women on what life would become for their uterus and freedoms under his dictatorship.
"Youre all such a bunch of sheep lol, go actually look at what the black community thinks of Trump and what hes done for them, dont listen to these puppets lol"
Trump is saying EVERYTHING that he is which has NOTHING to do with VP Kamala Harris.
just another example as to why Trump is too dangerous and his rhetoric is becoming more and more violent!
Republicans and Donald Trump all are projectionists
If this were your 78 year old uncle speaking this way in public you would be putting him in a nursing home
"Dumb donald needed his daddy's help to get into good schools. Now his nypd mafia are using the same school cheating network to get their own dumb sons into top schools, particularly a top college in western Massachusetts."
The only crock running for president is Donald Trump.<br>His followers are dumb as a rock.
trump is very sick person...he needs meds and doctor
It took THREE hours to end January 6. Remember? UNDER DONALD TRUMP.
"Even BALLOTS in California can be requested in different languages like Spanish, and Chinese. But we all know one of the requirement for becoming a citizen is to be able to read/write in English. That proves  those who get these ballots are not citizens."
Miscroscopic crowd....did you see Harri's crowd in Las Vegas?  100 to 1...maybe 1000 to 1. Can we flush this turd once and for all? I live in PA and it embarrasses me to see my fellow PA people clap for this turd.
He believes only God he trusts with votes! Does not this mean that he wouldn’t accept the vote results?
Wow he's getting very desperate
"Kamala has been and is a LIAR, INCAPABLE AND CORRUPT"
"Historically speaking, its republicans who mostly do the cheating during election time. Gerrymandering especially."
"TRUMP IS SLOW, DUMB, AND IGNORANT.....IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT TRUMP OR HIS SUPPORTERS SAY...........GOD HAS POSITIONED KAMALA HARRIS TO BE THE FIRST FEMALE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.........YOU ALL CANNOT STOP GOD."
Always play the race card MSNBC
He reminds me of the man with the little moustache from Germany.
trump is out of control!!! You wouldn’t even believe GOD himself
ALWAYS someone else's fault. Trump is going to take the whole GOP down...and I can't wait.
"I live in W. PA...and I can tell you driving the rural roads...there are a LOT less, sometimes NO, Trump signs for miles.Much different than 2020. Of course that doesn't mean they won't vote...so make sure YOU VOTE FOR HARRIS/WALZ..<br><br>.....and if you can donate ANYTHING to the Harris campaign...please do. Or Ruben Gallego in Texas or Jon Tester in Montana. We can NOT lose in November.Harris needs the Oval AND Congress."
If Kamala was not mentally ill then she would not allow 10s of thousands criminals and murderer enter our country while being border czar. If she is not mentally ill then she is a TRAITOR to America and did act of treason.
Why can’t he be STOPPED!!!!!
Hear the trained seals clapping in the background
"I’m worried about Trump, but I’m much more worried about the fact that there are enough Americans supporting this crazy bigot to make this electoral race a “close one”. It’s unbelievable…and for the second time in a row…"
"The red MAGA hats have become a modern symbol of division and hate, much like the white sheets once worn by those who stood for bigotry and fear. Trump's rhetoric has emboldened a dangerous rise in racism and extremism, and it's clear that these red hats represent more than just a political preference—they stand for the intolerance and ignorance tearing our country apart. We must reject this dark path and instead stand for equality, justice, and unity. Vote Blue to ensure that America moves forward, not back into the shadows of hatred and division."
"He’s a very smart smart guy if he only had a brain, he’d a brain!"
Trump is making US ridicule in front of the rest of the world.
Look. the hole world is holding their  breath. Trump is so.........if he wins I really feel sorry for all Americans. I have always looking up to USA but what have happened with your politic???Thank God for Kamala. Sweden is holding its breath
They have to be taught.  Let's attack Americans because of how they look or what language they speak?!  This is not America.
😂
"Trump is going to the area that is destroyed by hurricane to see for himself of what happened and what needed to be done. On the other hand Harris is going to DC, and just will be briefed by others  on what happened and what needs to be done, EXACTLY like what she did for the borders."
"How any American, with all of their faculties, even consider voting for Donald Trump , is mind boggling."
"So, this is what a cult looks like as it withers. maga = BYE BYE!!"
What is the crowd cheering at?? There is no bottom to this barrel
"The scarriest thing is not even Trump, it's the people that are so ignorant and uneducated to really support anything that comes from his mouth. These people think they are patriotic, but instead are helping a potential dictator to power. The fact that he still has almost half of the country voting for him, is deeply troubeling."
And democrats are failing!<br>The FCC just fast tracked the George Soros purchase of 220 plus radio stations before November's election. They have never skipped the review process which usually takes 6 to 9 months. Now you see the Democrat party in full View. There are no rules or laws that can't be broken

"How can this be accepted by anyone in the US? Imagine kids  hearing an 'adult' behave like  a teen bully. <br><br>And this man is the best the Republican party could get?<br><br>I am not sure if the US will come back from this, as the appeasement the last period has made it worse."
"You are such a darn liar and your derogatory remarks are tasteless and harmful and unkind!  Remember when you point a finger   Three point back at you! And if you want something done, ask a woman! The fly is looking for the heap of sh1t talking!"
He started his political career by asking for Barack Obama's birth certificate. Then said he would build a wall on the border and ban all Muslims. Trump has made it extremely clear to the voters from day one that he is a racist full of hatred.
"Yet, the two people that tried to take him out were white American Republican men."
I still find it incredibly ironic that he calls her mentally impaired when he can't even pronounce her name correctly.
"trump in his insane rants must be talking about himself, vote blue because our sanity depends on the outcome of the election."
So much projection. How can his people accept this behavior.
"Here it is, trumpists do not watch news.  They do not pay attention to what trump does.  The internet has condensed them in groups.  When you ask what did trump do for you, they answered with 2016 garbage.  These items are talked about in those internet groups.  This is why when they finally go to a rally they leave.  Then back to the internet."
Well flies do love a nice peice of S***
Side by side ads with this “ mental “ speech. Cut in Kamala saying if you have something to say say it to my face in a second debate.
That fly was around his soiled Depends!!!
Guaranteed to win the racist votes!
"So nobody in Springfield,Oh schools, no one can speak English huh!?  This guy is seriously sick in the head."
"This is a mentally impaired man, how dare he insult people out there actually suffering from this disability."
Remember Barron Trump got mental issues also..Trump be careful with your language
Do those idiots who are cheering realize that there are white criminals also.Trruummpp is the first one who is going to be locked 🔒 up
Mika's face tho...lmbo
"Getting the sense that, when Trump was a kid, his crayon box was all white crayons.  The other crayon colors were ""deported"" to the garbage can."
Trump talks about his own mental state…..please how long can you Americans listen to this narsictic liar. It is so embarrassing. How far reaches freedom of speech in America??? Take care and vote BLUE
What’s the IQ of most of the people in his crowd.
might be time for biden to get seal team 6 involved
Listening to him is it sounds like Jim Jones and he is serving orange kool aid to his red hat followers

"I think this election is a true measure of the quality of people that this nation has. I will get to the point, in layman's terms, and let me say this is seldom acknowledged because everyone is more interested in being superficially politically correct than addressing the obvious issue of humanity's problems at the root core. There is also ignorance which blinds the mind and spirit of many. <br><br> Black and White are the basic colors of the duality that has existed ever since the 33 percent of fallen angles fell from the grace of God to earth, according to scriptures, and created havoc on the Adamic ""organic,"" seed of earth, by mixing DNA.   If any particular body of individuals has poisoned the bloodline of Adam, it is these fallen rebels, and usurping dominion of earth from such. But it has been twisted by the same wicked bloodlines in the form of projection, sound familiar with the tactics used in this election? <br><br>Earth has been far too long ruled by bloodlines of these fallen entities, and I do believe that the only filter to the origins of the organic fabric of earth will be by what type of spirit people have in them, when all is said and done, as we are so diversly blended, and it is hard to tell sometimes who is of wicked or good spirit. Only God knows the true nature of each individual. <br><br>Since good always prevails, I am optimistic that the leader of choice is obviously clear to any decent human being and citizen of this nation. I mean how can it not be, when the opposite is so vile in spirit and rhetoric."
Trump will win. Vote Trump. Vote Maga
I get my mail-in ballot tomorrow in Florida. Voting Democrat across the board.
Kamala is so creepy and she will lose by a huge margin..
Not racist at all.. most of the time the truth HURTS! 😂
Harris should sue him for slander
Kamala made a fool out of Trump in the debate. What does that say about his mental capacity.
This man CAN NOT be President. 💙💙💙💙💙
"This is insane! This is terrifying! Scarier is that people are cheering for his violent threats! If Kamala wins through their voter suppression schemes, I fear we will see violence in America like we've never seen here before"
Trump's parents were immigrants and all he marries are immigrants.
"Horrible ""speech"" by the former  President."
"Harris is way more intelligent, wise, intellectual  than trump  ,even a 5 year old kid can make such a distinction. The stupidest 78 year old who  ever lived"
One rough decade is what we have suffered through.
"Just keep trump under the microscope, you don't have much longer to go. And don't ask important questions like why did Harris cover up Joe's cognitive decline and don't ask why Biden/Harris DOJ are trying to get illegals to vote in  Alabama?"
..what a horrible person trump it...
The stupid trump
"Remember, with narcissists, every accusation is an admission."
"And Trump will die that way,never used his one braincell given at birth."
Trump spouting his greatest hits. I’ll be happy when we don’t have to hear from him again.
"In any other supposedly civilised country in the world, Trump wouldn’t get near a presidential election. What’s going on , America. This is soooooo dangerous."
"Trump is telling people what they want to hear.  Not everyone buys into his lies but one heck of a lot do believe him.  And that is a gigantic problem for you, your partner, your kids and me.  And I am not even a citizen of the USA.  The United States of America.  Trump will change that to Ununited States of America.  Just listen to what he plans and you just might see that he is following an age old rule in war - ""divide and conquer"".  MAGA people need to understand that.  I do hope that the rest of the US citizenry understands that fundamental reality also.  Course, I am an ordinary guy with my own opinion and I could be reading things wrong.  Trump just might be ""the chosen one"" - good grief!"
Republicans are concerned? They created this mess!
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao-Dsq5OJTA&t=270"">4:30</a>.  I think the fly smelt the bullsh1t from 50 miles away"
It's amazing.  There are teachers that speak Spanish all over the US.
I can't even listen to his voice anymore.  It makes me ill. 🤦‍♀️
The rare best that the VP Harris can do is ignore the orange turd completely! He is truly afraid and jump on with that he knows and Hussan all knowledge about that movie bullying
"The Irony is that at worst; even slave owners knew the economic value of their ""property"", MAGA racist are just plain stupid."
You guys got this all wrong. ......😳😳😳😳. Mr. Trump is not racist.....He is MAGA Racist...
This guy is a shmuck
Independence day 😅 coming
The man is deranged and dangerous.
"People say that Harris will win.  Trump and his inner circle know this as well.  Why isn't anyone talking about Trump and his lawyers in every swing state holding the state elector's hostage by having them not certify the result of that state.  No President-elect will become president if the states do not certify the results.  That's real.  Trumps legal team is gearing up to have state electors NOT certify the results.  And if you cannot certify, the vote goes to Congress.  That's the angle Trump is taking, and no one is talking about it.  Scary!"
Constitutional rights 101😅
can't wait until his trial is over and he's in prison.
"Its one thing to oppose Harris on policy.  I'm a democrat and plan to vote for her and I can think of a few things I don't agree with.  But Trump's hateful, personal attacks, based in lies; this dark vision Trump brings, that add no value in terms of a contrast between his policies and Harris'.  Ever since he came down that escalator nine years ago, bringing with him unprecedented corruption, immorality and hatred,  America has become a worse place for it.  People are tired of it, and want to turn the page on all that."
"Well, it takes one mentally impaired person to know another mentally impaired person. He is just the Narcissist projectiing his own faults onto others..."
Please name the high crimes and misdemeanors committed by Harris- You cant.
"I hate to say this, but boneheads are following a bonehead."
"He's been watching the ""purge"" dw thinks its real ffs!"
Still they are less impaired than he is.
"I pay attention, but one of the things I don't know: If a presidential candiadate were to pass away before the election (and I do mean of natural causes), who would become the new presidential candidate? Serious question."
Joe has to neg almost everything Mika says.
I am so tired of this man..I feel like we are being tortured every single day he opens his mouth
"Angry, old and desperate."
I hope to see some hard pushback from the Harris campaign because we know that there will be those who will swallow all the Trump BS whole.
The only one mentally disabled is Trump. He talks about people eating cats and dogs that is not true and hurt a town and many people just because he could not handle is crowd sizes being low and people walking out be mentioned by Kamala at the debate. Trump is not mentally well and unfit to hold office.
"Someone needs to explain to CNN, MSNBC, CBS, NBC, ABC that Trump is RIGHT about Kamala Harris NOT being black! She literally has zero African ancestry. Her mother is 100% Indian and her father is 1/2 Indian and 1/2 Irish. Her father was only born in Jamaica, and is NOT of Jamaican descent! Harris’ great great grandfather was a major slave trader, having owned 1200 slaves at one point!"
"Trump says there is something wrong with Kamala and we all know it. In all sincerity, Kamala's mental problem is that she's an alcoholic and has been compromised many times during public presentations. Kamala has many tell-tale signs of being inebriated when she responds to questions."
"Blame Blk communities for stealing an election again. Blks do not vote for a party that WS support. We do not vote for politicians that care more about Corporations and lobbyists more than people. We don't vote for politicians that try to control our lives. We do not vote for politicians that are blatant racist. We don't cheat, we vote and we especially vote in Presidential elections."
Flies are attracted to 💩
"Half of the US is not only responsible for the destruction of American democracy, but a danger to progress in the rest of the world. The other half of the US should do everything possible to make sure they vote on election day, to prevent this atrocity from happening!!!!"
"So he is calling for a Kristalnacht... yeah, I think I can see where he's going with this. 🤮🤮🤮"
"Look at his combover; he's given up trying to appear presentable.  That's a sign of mental decline.  He doesn't talk about policy; he lies about & attacks immigrants, mis-pronounces his opponents name & lies about her, attacks anyone who's ""disloyal"" to him.  He's not telling us how he'll make our lives better; he's telling us how he's going to use the machinery of government to destroy those who he hates.  This is a mentally very ill old man; there's no way anyone should trust him with anything important (as further documented & demonstrated by his stealing of national secrets & classified information) ..."
You trump is out of control
Total projection
Trump is so vicious
"When you have no arguments, no policies, you start insulting your opponent with lies. trump only tells lies."
We're watching a real Klan rally in 2024
You guys are sick! TDS 😂😂😂 WE SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOU TWO SHEEPLE FYI!
There is NOTHING racist about calling out the criminal invasion of our country!
"Where is she or Biden for that matter now?  She is not the brightest crayon or much of a VP, but she could be in the south helping like Trump is doing right now."
This man very disgraceful.. trump WEAK !!! weak weak !
Hey Mutt and Jeff President Trump is in Georgia supporting the flood victims where is giggles downing a bottle of expensive wine on the taxpayer's dime?
She dusted Trump in the debate and he can't handle it.  She used his toupee to wipe the walls down then handed it back to him.  Now she living rent in his medulla oblongata😒
All the predominantly blk cities and states he talks about.
Vote blue up and down and let's put him in jail!!!!
"Some many millions continue to listen to him hopefully less than 2020. Even they must recognize that he is unqualified to confront and attempt to resolve the challenges at home and abroad that have nothing to do with the border and "" immigrants"" whoever he thinks they are. Is that enough for MAGA ? Probably is."
Trump  is  mentally   impaired… who  wants  a  president   Who  is  crazy
the voice of desperation
"Imagine living through these disastrous past four years and still wanting to vote for the exact same people who are responsible for all of it just because a specific someone whos been living in your head rent free for 9+ years since 2015 continues to hurt your fee fees with words and mean tweets, thats so weird, LOL. 💙❄️💧🤣"
JD Vances wife curried my KITTEN 😢
I know people still voting for Trump are legitimately ok with him as a human being. He's a terrible and racist person.<br><br>He has no policy so its not a policy thing<br><br>He wants the purge<br><br>And he's anti Black and Brown immigrants
"Want another delusional person…check out this tiktok mom 🤦🏽‍♀️ 👇🏽 <br> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-CMeydi53U"">https://youtu.be/t-CMeydi53U?si=PJuOMQgTUev8GnM-</a>"
"FACT CHECK TYPE 2 Diabetes: For the most part I am in agreement with the outrage of fat-acceptance in this vide. HOWEVER, Type-2 diabetes does have a genetic component and can be experienced by someone who does live a healthy life style. That does NOT mean your life isn't in your control, probably means you need to continue being healthy and take medication to control your insulin/sugar levels. To say Type 2 diabetes is always someone's fault is ignorant. Some people cannot reverse their insulin dysregulation because their disease is too far advanced OR it's just their genetics. <br><br>Personal experience: I run on average 15km per week, weight train 1-3x per week, and eat a protein heavy diet. My BMI is 21.1 and in my mid-20s. + PCOS  Due to my family history / genetics, I'm ALMOST at the ""at-risk"" range for my A1C!! Even though I'm ""healthy"". <br><br>Type 2 has a ""VERY STRONG"" genetic component. <br><br>"" Type 2 diabetes has a stronger link to family history and lineage than type 1, and studies of twins have shown that genetics play a very strong role in the development of type 2 diabetes. Race can also play a role.
<br>
<br>Yet it also depends on environmental factors. Lifestyle also influences the development of type 2 diabetes. Obesity tends to run in families, and families often have similar eating and exercise habits."" <br><br><a href=""https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/genetics-diabetes#:~:text=Type%202%20diabetes%20has%20a,also%20depends%20on%20environmental%20factors"">https://diabetes.org/about-diabetes/genetics-diabetes#:~:text=Type%202%20diabetes%20has%20a,also%20depends%20on%20environmental%20factors</a>."
If the obese had to pay for thier extra poundage daily they would lose wieght real quick. I GUARANTEE IT!
I don’t think anyone cares about health. It’s all about attraction and what comes with being seen as entirely ugly.
"""He""? She seems like a woman to me"
Wait till they see how much weight their idol lizzo has lost!
"Ozempic is destroying Americas medical insurance.  Its literally bankrupting the insurance companies.  In America,  this drug costs three times as much as it dies in most nations , and almost 10 times what ut costs in its country of origin!<br>Im sorry if your overweight, get a gym membership! I am not paying gugher taxes ro get your fat on your ass smaller! <br>Diet and exercise is not that hard! Start slow,  do small cha ges for a time, then add to that , and so on! <br> I broke my neck, couldnt stand up straight and my muscle atrophied and muscke death was a painful period of real hell, destoying one kidney on top of the damage from destroyed nerves.<br> My choices were drugs and surgery to fuse my spine and basicly be highly handicapped and disabled. Guess what j choose, none of the above, day by day i started to oush what i could, forcing my body to function and restructure how it did things. Using bodybuilding and anatomy books, i figured what musckes did what and how to move and hse my body in a way it could work. I lost my right pectoral major,  one triceps head, my right lat tie ins, so i was seriously crooked and had issues moving hakf my body, and i STILL figured it out! Its been three years since i broke my neck, ive had no surgery,  take no medication or oain killers except thc/cbd at night for inflammation,  and i can do calisthenics,  i lift 315 for reps on the bench, deadlift 525 for reps, and squat 225 , i cant squat heavy due to pressure on my neck and spine from the bar, but i KNOW i coukd do more , just not worth it.<br> I am sock of hearing the excuses! I get depression,  say that, dont say your bkdy js okay! Your depressed and lazy due to it, hut you can push out. Start small, go for a short walk every day for a week, tgen a longer walk, then matbe walk faster , then start short runs. Just start moving , moving will hekp change your thoughts and break the depression! If you need a friend or advice , im here, i am certified,  but i offer this free, i got certified for myself not for work, and im passionate about this! You ypu understand what i went though, i was told my life is over,  i had to accept it, get surgery and take oain killers forever and it was medically impossible to fix and there is nothing that can be done, now they wamt to study me lol, saying i reprogrammed my nervous system somehow which is also impossible! The bidy and mind can do anything you are patient enough and brave enough to work towards! The reward is freedom! I am a respected and known bodybuilder,  with a broken neck, that has won shows at 45 years old , gained 40 pounds of muscle. If i can do it anyone can!"
Just got surgery and they took photos of multiple areas of my body internally and can confirm that i do have fat around my organs
culture and environment do contribute to people becoming obese and these factors are outside of their control.   Modern culture has an obsession over food and rich recipes that exaggerate cravings rather than satisfy them.
Not fatties acting like being fat isn't a privilege again 🙄😬😹
"Ummmm ... ""he""... ??? 😂😂🤣🤣😂😂 and this weirdo thinks that being fat isn't a problem. So much denial here.. just buy them a one way ticket to Egypt 🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣"
"I don't have anything funny to say to that.<br>But, i'd like to say how how much i enjoy your channel!❤"
he? that's a woman.
"I'm 55, a lifelong smoker and while not in the best shape, I'm an active dirt biker so I'm not in the worst shape either. If their weight is so healthy, let us jog half a mile up a hill and see how incredibly agile these obese excuse makers are."
"""There's no evidence this, there's no evidence that"" but he doesn't cite one single article that explains why our current medical knowledge is so wrong. Oh, of course, it's because all scientists and MDs are evil little creatures that want to exterminate all the fattys so they deliberately frabicate all data against obesity, no article can be trusted. Unless the ones that say that xyz patients died after losing weight (they had cancer)"
"Remember, the same people who shouted ""trust the science!"" in 2020 are the same ones who are ignoring dietary and health science."
Why are you using her dead gender?
He still claims to be a doctor on his website.
The problem is she will just go on to become a health influencer or some stupid term like that and people will still follow her.
who are you calling HIM?does she think shes a him? makes sense shes delusional AF
"💩💩💩 millions of people who have a healthy weight, usually have a healthy diet and active lifestyle. That doctor deserves to be banned for life from practicing medicine."
This is what she wanted. She wanted to get fired and become a martyr to these people to take even more money from them. Much more money in that
"The worst part: she could have practiced in the NHS system, which is UK public healthcare, wasting that money on her lunacy."
That ford truck needs to shut up i was 410  im around 360 now best decision ive made to lose weight i feel better yes still trying to lose more
If it’s okay to be obese then why aren’t they okay with the word?
She says people should ACCEPT being fat and don't change their physical body. But couldn't accept her gender and sought to change it. LOL. Yes...SHE. I said SHE.
💩💩💩💩💩💩
"So basically, a doctor who doesn't believe in modern medicine. Seems like they chose the wrong profession, simple as that."
"Getting our weight,blood pressure and heart rate checked happens everytime I go to see a doctor. I thought it was normal"
“You can be healthy at all sizes!”<br><br>My family is every shape and size and half my family is either diabetic or has heart problems.
🙄
"Despite how bad they are, thank you for using his pronouns lol"
"Wait ""he""?"
you used 3 different pronouns for this woman
I may have reported this person 👀 thanks for bringing this to light in the first place.
I hated being fat so I started walking everyday list 80 lbs no excuse being fat is healthy
No fat around the organs. Explain T2 diabetes and fatty liver disease.<br><br>Also ozempic is not a weightloss drug
It's interesting to me how a lot of these weirdos have outsides that match their insides.<br>The vibe of this sudo-doc is petty and malicious. And his appearance certainly backs it up!
"I didnt really care about how my body look and still dont, so i ate whatever i like back then and became obese. But one day i ended up hospitalized because of high blood pressure. I dont care how my body look but i care about my health."
"A family friend is a GP. She struggles with her weight but always  is honest with her patients about her issues and tries to stay on track with her weight because she has seen what obesity can do, brother is a vet, he is at the gym every day because he says how can you tell someone their pet (and normally their owner) is overweight if you are too!"
Wait isnt that the same Person who claimed that Gender isnt Real but also claimed to transgender? If Gender isnt real being Transgender isnt real either your Idiot
Love Ya. Poop Emoji.
💩
She! The doctor is a woman.
Love the mini plastic dogs with mini Michelle!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=590"">9:50</a> in that context doesn’t “diet” just refer to a way of eating? meaning everyone has a diet. i think that’s what they meant. and by exercise they probably meant having a lack of it. not backing this person but just wanted to point that out haha"
He? Lol
"Weight loss is Harmful is only true in SOME cases like mine. Im underweight, but if your Obese and over just Obese, weight loss isnt harmful at all. Its just healthy"
I dont wish to be smaller <br>I wish to not die due to diabetes XDDDD
"if they really thought being fat was healthy they wouldnt mind getting on the scale or want doctors to only tell them what they want to hear. and if these people arent lazy, y is it that the only time they get up is to talk more stupid shit on social media like these video clips. with all the hard work they did talking all that shit they couldve lost weight by now"
"Listening to my body's cues is why I'm a type 2 diabetic. It's why I'm 40 pounds overweight. That extra weight is why my back pain from auto and work accidents is made even worse. <br><br>All those things are why I'm trying to fight those cues. Fighting against my body's cues is why I've lost 15 pounds in the last two months. And hopefully, will continue to lose more as I try to reverse, or at least hold off, the damage years of listening to my body's cues has done."
"@Michellemcd543 I am confuse, isn't this person a woman? why do you keep saying ""He""."
"So what are they supposed to do lie to you? It's true that certain illnesses won't be cured if you lose weight but I rather be at a healthy weight and manage it versus being obese and dealing with it. If anything there are major benefits in losing weight such as not struggling to move, fitting into clothes a lot better lowering your risk for obesity related risk and you even save more money when you control your portions at the supermarket. She sounds like that doctor Kat that basically said and wrote the same things but she died from complications of being obese."
i’m 7 minutes in and i just realised she kept saying he- that’s a man? 😭
"I am a 54 year old with extreme stomach issues. I have been 200 lbs all the way down to 90 lbs. I am not an adult designed to be that small. I literally looked like a walking skeleton. The other thing I went through was almost giving myself type 2 diabetes. I had developed a love for herbal teas that I sweetened with honey. Sounds healthy. The problem, as it turns out, was I was putting way too much honey in it. So it was more like a little tea with my honey.  Once my amazing nutritionist figured out what I was doing, we were able to turn it around. To hear a medical professional say type 2 diabetes is not your fault is crazy."
So she’s delusional about weight and gender…. That adds up. 😂
these doll videos are so fun I love them
That woman's an absolutely deranged narcissist.
That’s a man?
She’s crazy
And the doctor's ain't fat lifting up only a pen and a notebook
💩
"Michelle, you know that exercise can cause the weight gain - if you do anaerobic exercises a lot, your muscles will grown but you knows it already. Also diet also cause the weight gain because  diet is the sum of food consumed by a person, but dieting means the change eating habits to lose fat tissues.  For example, the anaroxic persons get a diet and an exercise plan (my close friend went through that) to gain weight. So by my opinion, fatdoctor just manipulates the terms. It is like if I have a lot jellyfish and can say that I have the fish tank, by term it is correct but jellyfish are the medusa-phase of certain gelatinous members of the subphylum Medusozoa (medusas) and not fish (an aquatic, anamniotic, gill-bearing vertebrate animal). I am against the trend to see fatness as something good and positive, I simply use the my professor in the human physiology method to understand why someone has wrong conclusion from the facts."
"Are you switching pronouns on purpose? Sometimes you call her a she sometimes its a he? Also, isnt his name Asher not Ashmeer? I agree with your video, but why go after the fact theyre trans ot get their name wrong? I don't understand?"
"Loves fat trans people and hates old people. Yeah, these 2 groups will never coexist because morbidly obese trans people tend to die young."
"I gained a lot of weight going through peri-menopause.  I had a lot of issues during this 9.5 year time frame.  Gained 50+ lbs in about 2 weeks.  Just popped up one day.  I didn't start losing weight until I was put as Menopaused.  I dropped 20 lbs in one month.  This stuff is serious and can cause one to be diabetic, heart diseased and other stuff.  I was insulted by a doctor (GYN) to get gastric bypass surgery.  I will NOT go through that.  She never looked at my hormone levels and did not offer any other help.  I did not see a GYN for close to 10 years.  She was the worst.  Very insenstive.  However, I tried, but the hormones were so wacked out (worse that what I experienced during pueberty).  My blood sugers are down to pre-diabetic levels after 13 years.  I'm wanting off medicines and don't want to be a slave to them."
💩
"Obese is a medical term there is nothing wrong with it. My doctors told me all the time that I was medically obese when I was around 250 lbs to 260 lbs. Yeah not massively obese but still obese because of my height.<br><br>The doctor doesn't hate you for telling you this. Because he is taught in school the correct term. Or would you like if doctors go ""Hey you fat f**k !"" that I hear during my youth?<br><br>Fasting glucose showing you are diabetic is real it is not fake.<br>Knee joints that literally creak and ache is real and not fake.<br>High blood pressure, causing migrane is real and not fake.<br>Sleep apnea, literally suffocating to death in your sleep is also real and not fake. <br><br>It took me years to bring down my HbA1C to 5.4% and cholesterol to 229 mg/dl. <br>It was all worth it."
"They need to know your weight so they can prescribe the correct amount of medicine. And if being fat is fine, why are so many body positivity influencers dying so young?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=513"">08:33</a> what is scary is how many people liked his assinine comment!"
Sorry - “he”? Really?
Yes it does. Being fat is unhealthy period or has been proven beyond and doubt that being obuse is not good
Ooof. She gross…..
"2 delusions in 1. Once you start believing you are born in the “wrong body”, then what stops you from believing in other nonsense!"
I really be sitting here watching your doll. And I’m entertained 😂🫶🏽 you’re changing me omg
"My doctor isn't afraid to tell me when I need to lose weight and I'm thankful.<br>I lost 80 lbs as a teenager (he's been our family doctor since I was maybe 6?) and he had lots of questions to make sure it was done safely. And it was, thankfully.<br>My mom too, was never afraid to caution me if I was losing track. Not in a mean or derogatory manner, simply out of love and care.<br>I was blessed to have such people."
Beens and rice is good for you
"i don't understand how all these fat influencers ALL just happen to have diabetes, mobility issues, or disabilities that are completely unrelated to their diet and size.  what a crazy coincidence"
"If you’re going to pretend that she isn’t a woman, can you at least stick to one set of incorrect pronouns? Switching between referring to her as a man and as multiple people in the same sentence is just confusing."
Conciquences!
"Haha this ""it's a genetics thing"" always cracks me up. I guess everyone who had been to death camps or people starving in third world countries have just unlucky genetics, too bad"
"You keep saying HE. You Keep Using That Word, I Do Not Think It Means What You Think It Means. If that is a he, I am a Yorkshire Terrier."
"I am SO damn tired of people claiming that fatphobia is racist. The implication that black people are just naturally fat is racist. These people see that a lot of black people are fat and don't consider that there's a regional culture reason for that and not a genetic one. <br><br>People who live in tribes in Africa, like the Himba, eat diets rich in protein and don't eat processed foods and sugars. They are constantly moving and are all at a very healthy weight. There may be SOME black communities where fatness is equated to beauty, but that's not a rule across the board. <br><br>Black people aren't ""just naturally fatter,"" and the insistance that that's the case and therefore fatphobia is racis IS what's actually racist."
"That’s not a dude though, that’s a chick right? I can’t tell who is who in the story with the nonsense pronoun use<br>But if that chick is the “Dr.” then why would it shock anyone someone confused by a mirror would reject the reality of health?"
"I work in public health so I know lots of homeless people and drug users and the sheer amount of negligence and abuse they experience from <b>doctors</b> and <b>nurses</b> - really just any hospital staff is horrific. From refusing to treat patients, to denying them any medication, not letting a person even rest in the waiting room despite bleeding profusely from the head. The worst was a client who had no legs and was carried out and abandoned in the snow with no wheelchair and only wearing a t-shirt. <b>That</b> is true medical trauma and abuse, not being told that you need to lose a little weight."
I can't believe the trenchpool got her  doctorate after matilda
I’ve kept 50 lbs off for forty years. My back hasn’t gone “out” since.
💩
I'm a busy mom and while I clean the kitchen I listen to your videos and it truly does save me from scrolling and reading haha. I get all my drama in my earpiece while I clean haha
Came here cos of the algorithm.... Stayed for the biceps lol
The barbie version of you was well done
I get how an average person with no medical knowledge could be tricked into believing that obesity is ok. But for a doctor this requires an extra special level of delusion. I feel embarrased to be from the UK.
"I'm type 2 diabetic, after losing 50lbs my body was able to reverse the diabetes."
"(I am a physician assistant) This person should lose their license, and probably get sued to hell. There's just about a billion meta-studies and systemic reviews (the highest levels of studies possible), showing that obesity is the No 1 preventable cause of premature loss of life closely followed by nicotine abuse, in the first world. A doctor actively harming patients is like, the biggest no-no possible xD"
He?
Denying sex and claiming to be trans counts me out. I wouldn’t trust anything else this person says.
How in the world could she get a medicine degree????<br>That's just impossible in my mind.
This is my preworkout. LMAOOO. 💀
Lol he just wants to be fat😂🤣. I don't ugh. Im going to try to loose my 50 pounds.
I have been a type 2 since I was a little kid. I wasn't overweight when I was younger but then I start gaining weight around 10. Now I have to get rid of these 50 pounds😅 at 35.
The fat is affecting this unDoctor Brain
"So this person went through four years of undergrad, took the bitch of a test that is the MCAT and went through the arduous medical school admissions process, got in and did 4 years of med school, did a residency, all to peddle this nonsense and lose their license? Talk about a massive waste of time and money"
"When I go for my annual checkup, the first thing my doctor’s assistant does is take my blood pressure and weigh me.  That’s SOP for a visit.  If these women are so in love with their fat bodies, why are they so triggered by having to step on a scale?"
🤔 if this person is so convinced fat people are healthy. Then they should lose weight and document how they start feeling. Just watch their mood be like I feel better about myself.
"We really need to stop promoting self love and start promoting self-respect. Self love allows you to treat yourself go on vacations pamper yourself get that extra donut or hot Cheetos or whatever because you love yourself and you should spoil who you are. Self-respect is greater than self-love because you respect yourself enough to go to the gym you respect yourself enough to eat healthy and that is actually real love. Self-respect sometimes requires us to do things we don’t wanna do, but we respect ourselves enough to do those things where our self love allows us to stay in a level of comfort and disillusioned."
💩
How much money is that person making from the food industry?<br>I have lost 60-90 pounds 3 times in my life. I know I feel a lot better at 220 than I do at 290 and have a hard time wiping my butt.<br>If that person lost weight they would be happier. 🤠
"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 No cure for being obese! They how did I loose 50lbs when i changed my diet and exercised then. Must have been the imaculate deletion! Ahhh, fat doctors are just not smart. If there is no such thing as being a fat so* o* a bit** then I am going to enter the Ms. USA pageant. Im 7 months pregnant but since there is not such thing as fat. Well ima gonna go eat some serious shi*. Now that i cant gain weight. Thanks doc i have never been given such a Fuc*** awsome excuse to eat! Worst comes to worse and you are bat shi* craz* then i got ozempic🎉🎉🎉. So im good yall!!!! Yea Yah!!!!"
"Not gonna lie, you calling that woman 'he' confused me quite a bit. This is clearly why this whole pronouns bullshit is bullshit cuz now we are all confused."
💩
"Holy shit, good for Tammy! I'm so happy for her!❤"
Anyone notice how everytime the Fat doctor says anything he never explains his point he just says something isn't true and moves on. ie Zero Evidence
"They will not be missed, as they say good riddance to bad rubbish."
I love Dr Idz...a voice of sanity on TikTok.
Its like Homer when they tried to make him exercise at work. Imagine being that afraid of losing some weight holy shit!
that doctor is too old irrelevant for her to bother.... but then she did then bother by commenting on his post.  This is the same lack of logic she applies to her medical practice.
“Listen to what your body tells you” <br><br>Alcoholic: I’m sober for 2 yrs now<br><br>Body: Let’s go get a drink <br><br>Alcoholic: But we don’t have self control <br><br>Body:yeah but you need to listen to me I know what’s best
I can ask a nearby company to use their pallet scale 🙂 and a forklift truck. But for an American 🤔 there is a truck weighing 'bridge' down the road and a railcar scale over there <points>
"i don't understand these people. trying to forbid words won't stop you from tilting an yacht when you walk around, or breaking chairs, or clogging the entrance to a bus. no matter what you call it, fat is fat."
"I understand hating the term ""obesity"" as far as there's a lot of shit Doctors used to say that are common insults now. Retard is a prime example. I genuinely wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the medical terms today are blacklisted from our vocabulary in 100 years. It's not the words that are bad, it's just how we use them, and no word is safe from being used as a pejorative."
This mini-verse is the thing we never knew we needed. Love.
"Jesus, I'm on ozempic, but if people think you don't have to do anything... what a waste. A waste of money, and time. You should change your diet, regardless. And exercise as much as you can. Like start slow, go for walks.... man, people who think its a freaking cheat code... so sadly mistaken."
💩
The simplest counter to anyone who says being fat is healthy: “where are all the fat old people?”
Fat people in denial to this extreme is almost kind of funny.
"Im currently prediabetic at 26. Weight is around 160-170 at 5""5. Im no obese ore considered overweight but still im prediabetic. Ive been going through alot the last 2 years and im also on antidepressants. I dont understand how obese people live like this and dont feel any guilt or shame. Im currently trying to shrink my stomach so i stop over eating by having smaller portions of food and eating less meals every day. And taking long walks so my body gets used to being on the move before i go back to the gym."
He my arse! She’s insane!
"Looks like the fat doctor was a failing doctor anyway and was not making any considerable amount of money, and that's why they decided to hop on the fat acceptance trend and did not giva a f**k about loosing their medical licence."
"You're so funny. 😂 I love your silly but REALLY searious videos.<br>People should stop eat so much  processed food, seems to really damage their brains and make them stupid. I'm in shock of all the stupidity nowdays...."
"""I don't have a brain, I'm plastic."" lmao"
"Between March and September of 2023 I lost about 30 pounds. So far I've kept most of it off, and am starting again, hoping for another 15 to 20 down by the end of this year. The final kick for me to do it was my idiot (now ex-) ortho telling me that the only problem with my knee was that I'm fat and lazy. So I lost the weight, started walking and doing exercise classes, lost almost half the weight I'd ideally like to lose, feel better in a lot of ways, but the knee? It hurts worse. So I've got a new guy, and we're trying to decide if it's bad enough yet to get it replaced. Spite is a powerful motivator, and I was determined to prove that first doc wrong, that I could lose the weight, and the exercise or lack therof wasn't the primary problem my knee was having. I feel good having proved both. <br><br>The next goal is to fit into a favorite dress I haven't been able to wear in about 15 years. <br><br>The worst part is knowing that in spite of the fact that I should lose at least another 40 pounds, I'm still pretty slender compared to a significant portion of the general population. At 5'5.5"" and 185 pounds I shouldn't be able to walk down a street or go through a mall and see so many people who make me feel svelte."
My final question of the day remains: Why does Lizzo think slapping herself across the belly means loving yourself? It's literally what I started doing when I was trying to find an alternative to c*tting myself. Slapping myself all over until my whole body stung.<br>Does she not have the power to bitch slap or is she simply masochistic? That's what I'd like to know.
"I’m not a doctor, but I am in school to be a surgical tech. I’ve seen the insides of people in the shadow and clinical work I’ve done. There’s totally fat around the organs lol. To deny that so proudly is insane."
"Also, I doubt many people would be bragging online that their wife lost weight after taking Ozempic, considering that means you are leaving evidence online of having acquired medication with likely illegal means as it sounds like she wasn't prescribed them. Who would ever be stupid enough to confess to something illegal when you don't know who can trace those comments back to you? Considering some employers even go as far as checking their employees TikTok account, someone you know might see it and get you in trouble for it if they held a strong stance on illegal drugs/medication."
"They are so irresponsible, I have to wonder if they even went to a medical school, because their rhetoric puts <i>human lives</i> at risk. And they don't care."
"Showing a mini version of Goosebumps is legends behavior. As a 26 year old, I loved how I got to be in the final years of that era. Like in The Netherlands this era includes a horror society of children literature writers and some of the writers like the late Eddie C Bertin eventually stopped printing their children's horror works so kids even a few years younger then me missed out. To this day I want to petition to his relatives if I can translate the Valentina series along with a copy of the final book because its such a rare gem in second-hand stores. He was primarily an adult horror author and it showed in the maturity levels as well as the fact it goes against children's commercial writing as spoiler alert but the heroine, Valentina, dies at the end of the series (which is supposed to be a huge no-no in children's books) and the story ends with her best friend visiting her grave and context: he messed around with magic in book 5 as he's looking for a love spell to cast on Valentina and it ends up going apocalyptically wrong. And the biggest tragedy of it all was that Valentina was beginning to return his feelings because he always had her back when fighting the occult even after they killed her mom and he would have gotten together with her if he hadn't made that stupid and toxic decision typical of an impatient 14 year old. It low-key ages so well precisely because as an adult you can see how well horror 'movie'  logic and the many stupid actions of the characters go well with the gripes of being an annoying or insecure teenager and how dark forces are preying on those and their naivety to get what they want. Like, its a whole lot less dumb and contrived to have 14 year olds fall into the trap of a monster then a grown adult who should have seen the red flags. If I could, I'd honestly recommend it to anyone who still loves their old Goosebumps novels and people who like horror centering children precisely because of their young mindset like the It movies did (the book shall not be named. I will forever be cautious around Stephen King after THAT scene)"
"After two decades of feels before reals, we need to bring back personal accountability and shame for wilful ignorance."
Cigarette smokers have to deal with these doctors too. There's no way smoking might make me have medical conditions.
Fat doctor uses he/they pronouns for all those making comments that want to use the correct pronouns.
"im supposed to call this obvious woman with a side ponytale breasts and make up on and a womans voice ""he""?.....k"
Your first mistake is taking any health advice from a fat person.That's a big red flag.
I was confused at first because you said man and I thought you was on about the asian guy but this video is about the woman pretending to be a man pretending that fat is not harmful. Ok I get it now.
It's really a f**ked up world we live in.
"Omfg you pulled a Thanos on the fat doctor and was like ok ima 1up you......""Now Reality can be whatever I want!"" Lmao Rofl"
Just because you're fat doesn't mean you're unhealthy and lazy!!!  <br>Well I'm slim 79 and walking several miles every day I meet many others out walking too and none of them are fat but I see fat people struggling to breathe after the slightest exertion like boarding a bus or train then they collapse into a seat usually in a ball of sweat. Fat people are lazy and unhealthy
Why are so many fat people in denial
I’m not trying to be offensive but I’m noticing a trend. A lot of these fat positive influencers end up transitioning? I wonder why?
"Can you stop calling her, he? Pretending to be a woman when you are a man is the same thing of saying you’re it’s not your fault when you’re 500 pounds. We need to stop with all of this delusion."
Not a he
"Good health begins with being honest with yourself. Health is not just another ""social construct""."
plastic Michelle is so cute 😍😍😍
I’m the average weight for my height (~45kg) and the doctor still makes me step on the scale. It’s not anything phobic. Just procedure. What are these people thinking ???
When these fat people yell about fat acceptance its the most cardio they’ll get all day.
💩
"I think the very first point about doctors telling people to go on a diet for anything is a real issue that happens to people. Im not saying they dont need to lose weight im not saying the doctor doesnt know what theyre talking about but the doctors that are being criticised in such videos are the ones that completely overlook someones symptoms and ignore their pain because of their weight. Fat people go in for anything and get told to lose weight. Its wrong, its unethical it SHOULD be criticised.<br><br>Secondly diabetes type 2 isnt always someones fault thats sort of an insensitive thing to say. There can be many causes and factors that put someone at a risk of getting t2d without it being their fault. The doctor telling the commentor that they shouldnt do anything to prevent diabetes despite being pre diabetic is wrong but you too shouldnt spread misinformation, considering the entire video is about the fact that the doctor is spreading misinformation"
He?
"I am technically obese as my BMI is above 30, and I can confirm I am lazy as I don't want to diet and exercise."
"Being fat isn't unhealthy, right up to the moment your arteries seize up."
"How do adipose cells (fat cells) get fat?   Excess glucose in the blood triggers an insulin response.  Insulin drives glucose out of the blood and into adipose cells through pores on the surface.  Inside the adipose cell, the glucose is combined with glycogen and become triglycerides.  Triglycerides are too large to pass through the pores of the adipose cells and are trapped or ""stored"" inside.  The adipose cells can expand to accommodate an almost unlimited number of triglycerides.  The ""craving"" experienced after eating too many carbohydrates that become glucose in the blood, is caused by the drop in glucose levels due to the insulin response. This sets up a continuous cycle of craving, eating, spiking, insulin release, crashing.  If left unchecked the result is obesity.  The problem is not fatty foods, not inactivity nor calories,  it is a carbohydrate rich diet.  This is why diets like the carnivore diet work so well.  There are no carbohydrates at all.  Without glucose in the blood, another reaction takes place.  Your body breaks down triglycerides into ketones and your body functions perfectly well using up all that energy stored inside your adipose cells.  This is biology, folks!"
Love the Michelleverse ❤
Why do you keep referring to it as he?
"That's a woman, pretending to be a man."
💩
oh no (she/he) is mentally ill >.> as soon as that email with the emoji's came out that just somsone who is mentally ill
Bureaucrats doing good for a change?! Color me impressed. I’m buying a lottery ticket tonight.
Let Darwin do its thing......
"This ""doctor"" quitting is what I refer to as a, ""Self-solving problem."""
looks like someone discovered the power of playing victim
"Well, rapid weight loss can be harmful, but she lies about there being no long term benefits with losing excess weight."
I’m fat
StillFatFormerDoctor
The claims of racism stifle the recognition of genetic differences both between populations and individuals that lead to different risk of various conditions. And the unfortunate thing is many of the people who would benefit the most are the most vocal in whining about racism
"I was obese, and type II diabetic. I am now only slightly overweight. I'm still diabetic. The tendency is genetic. I was able to get off insulin and some oral meds, but am still on others. My BMI has gone from 39 to 25. I am also pretty active and walk around 10 mile over the course of each week."
"Here is the problem, the body positivity movement went from the benevolent concept of ""you don't have to feel bad about yourself, or accept bad treatment, because you're big"" to the outright ridiculous concept of ""if you give me objectively factual medical advice that would suggest that my weight is going to cause health problems, you're fatphobic."" It's insane!"
"Did y’all know when she says subscribe, the button flashes"
As a brit i would like to apologise for this...erm.... thing. Not all brits are this f*cking stupid
I see you're also confused about fat doctor's gender.
"Why do you keep calling this strange woman ""him"""
The Barbie thing is so cute lol. Obsessed.
this video is better without the inconsistency in gendered language
"I can't wait for ozempic stuff to have its patent expired so it can go generic, thats like 15 years or so from now though I believe"
The Barbie with Hot Cheetos is everything.
Very funny!
"Of course, the Fat Doctor UK is now a  transman.  Who could have guessed this new development?<br> But they need to stay «relevant», especially as they can no longer practice medicine.<br><br>If I told my patients with Type I diabetes to just stop using their insulin, I would lose my license, too."
What less is only dangerous when it's take me to an extreme like starving yourself or anorexia and bulimia but weight loss done right it's not dangerous
lol the doll world :)
Rule #1 for a narcisist: Lies become the truth if you repeat them loud enough and often enough.<br>Sound familiar?
"The largest causal factor in gaining weight? Say it with me folks, O V E R I N D U L G E N C E.<br>I do it too. Everyone does it occassionally. Impulse ice cream is sometimes the most tasty. But i dont eat it every month. My mealtime kryptonite is pizza. I love pizza. I eat far too much pizza. And i am too fat. Do i want to have a smaller body though? Quite the opposite.<br><br>I WANT A LARGER BODY THAT WOULD MAKE STATUES IN ROME WEEP OPENLY AT MY PASSING FOR WITNESSING THE MAJESTY OF MY MUSCLES! I WANT TO WALK INTO A GYM AND HEAR GRAVITY ITSELF SIGH THAT A DUEL IS ONCE AGAIN UPON THEM! Its just... starting feels like such a chore..."
The reason people like FatnolongerDrUK exist is because now everyone with enough followers has a platform and it gives you more money and views to sprrad misinformation than to be a doctor.
It's also scientifically proven that obesity shrinks your brain.  Ops...
Any Dr who prompts an  agenda should have his or her  license revoked
"I had an issue. It wasn't around food, it was around soda. I drank way too much. Developed type 2 diabetes, and only knew after one of my toes got infected.<br><br>I'm no longer type 2 diabetic and I feel way better. I'm not tired all the time, I have way more energy, and I look better. All in my own opinion, if course. <br><br>I still have my toe, and I've cut all sugary drinks from my diet. That was 90% of my sugar intake. Now I'll have like half a Twix a week to curb any craving for sugar. I replaced the soda with flavored sparkling water and water.<br><br>I didn't accept my weight, but I didn't want to stop. That's something that's easy to acknowledge  especially after I examined my eating habits. A second shifter, where it was just easier to get McDonald's right before work and on the way home. That's two large sodas. Add in at least one 20 oz at work from the vending machine. <br><br>What made it worse was when I got my own house. I kicked it into overdrive. It was a bad craving, and I couldn't stop. Stopped real fast in the hospital, but a week before when I first found out, I dumped all the sugary drinks down the sink. It sucked, but I had to remove the temptation to go back.<br><br>I'm now 60 pounds lighter and feel fantastic. I take two walks a day to touch some grass. I'm looking into getting some weights, so that I can alternate. Walk one day, so arm exercises the next."
"You can't reverse it, once you have type 2 diabetes you will always have type 2 diabetes, excess sugar will always be a threat to you. The good news is that excess sugar is under your control. You can get addicted to sugar, no sorry, you can get addicted to the taste of sweet so artificial sweeteners can contribute to your addiction. If you are addicted your mind will insist you are hungry which can turn the difficult task of losing weight into an impossible task. The good news is that once you get your addiction under control you can now satisfy your body with a healthier diet and exercise and weight loss now becomes easy. The sad news is that while new damage from excess sugar can be stopped much of the damage already done may be irreversible. This takes not a diet but a drastic change in your diet every day. The real secret is not to go hungry and not to eat foods you don't like but to eat the healthiest foods you find acceptable. The sooner you get your type 2 diabetes under control the better the outlook. I was borderline morbidly obese and suffering from many of the health issues that come with type 2 diabetes. I am in my 8th year of having my blood sugar under control. Life is better."
"Omg i just noticed, I've never had an big doctor lol. All my doctors have never been like, unhealthy looking."
😅😅😅😅😅
I see a regular GP and my 28 BMI ass needs to get on a scale
How many FAT 70 - 80 year olds do you see??
Thats a dude? lol
"If I listened to my body's internal cues, I'd be bent out of shape on drugs all day every day."
Fat Doctor UK: I am leaving the medical profession!!!  Medical Committee:  Byyyye Felicia!
"Any social  media influencer using their platform to promote obesity need to be banned. They are threwat to public health.  Obesity is everyday becoming a global problem. Obesity,  is  a far bigger issue than influencers, but we need to tackle everything  , influencers, irresponsible food industry and the current work culture."
"This makes me beyond angry!!! Having this former “health care” professional is everything wrong with “body positivity”. As a former fat person, I made out in the effort and hard work decades ago and continue to lead a healthy lifestyle. As all of us age, it is how YOU make the decision to maintain proper diet and exercise for a quality of life. Exercise can be going for a walk, light weight training, swimming, yoga…..I’m not saying spend hours in the gym but do something!!! Trust me you will be better for it."
"Dr Natasha Larmie chose not to attend the General Medical Council hearing, which was for publicly saying she hates White men—not trying to accelerate people’s demise.<br>They gave her a formal warning for deviating from professional standards. They said her conduct didn’t “justify her patients’ trust in her and the public’s trust in the profession,” but doesn’t “pose a risk to public protection.”"
Modern Left: You must accept the science about COVID and climate change or you are a racist sexist homophobe! Also Modern Left: You are a racist sexist homophobe if you accept the science of biology and medicine!
"I do think environments contribute to obesity. Obesogenic environments where fruit and veg are hard to come buy, jink food is in abundance, there aren't footpaths to go walking, it's the social norm go out and eat all the time, working hours are.long, jobs are sedentary and sports clubs are expensive or hard to come by make healthy choices harder. Obesity is more prevalent amongst poorer people in developed countries and wealthy people in developing countries"
When did she become he? 😂
He??🤦
Wait…. He?
I never knew I needs a sassy doll spitting such hot fire and shit talk in my life. Then I remembered Team America was a thing and subscribed.
"If doctors stop using the medical term “obese”, what are they supposed to call it, and how long until they need to stop using that term too?"
This episode reminds me of MyFroggyStuff. 😂
"Don’t let the doctors say you are sick, it’s not appropriate to say that. You just have broken leg, it’s an abuse to say it is broken, say “you are perfect the way you are” 😅"
"That song at the end was nice, great video but the song was my favorite part 😂"
Not her talking to the comitee like they are her toxic ex 😭
"Why is this person being referred to as They, she and he🤔<br>Please pick one🤨"
"To be fair, American food isnt all that healthy, and mountains of it every week isnt going to help...<br>But that assumes that one does not in fact exercise."
"I wouldn’t even be able to take ozempic , I’d eat all the way through it , “appetite suppressant “ nah that won’t work and I know it 😭"
I’ve always know fat around organs are real cause of biology and being taught that but I also recently had a placement in theatres where I saw a lap appendix in a teen and a lap orchidopexy in a few months old there was noticeable difference in the fat around the organs depending on how old they are and how much fat they would have consumed by that time. It was such a weird thing to see cause I’d now it was real but obviously had never actually seen it around organs and now I just wish I could see what mine look like cause I’ve obviously consumed fat in my life and now I’m just curious to what my organs look like.
I dare any obese person who claims theyre just as healthy and fit at that size to come for a run with me.
Go to the doctor as a future diabetic is the right term.
This doctor probably thinks humans can become the opposite sex as well.
He is a she right?
Her sarcastic Barbie reminds me of Most Popular Girls School lmao. 😂<br>Solid vid as usual!
What is this thing apart from confused? She he they? What? Confused.
"i don´t like being fat.... lets get rid of the word ""fat""... very powerful Logic ^^"
Omg Michelleverse is so cool!
He or she?
I'd rather listen to an old doctor than an obese doctor.
"i'm so confused, is the fat doctor a girl, a man or a they? you called her all 3 throughout the whole video. i was so lost who you was talking about the entire video because you also showed other faces/videos. 😅"
all that work down the drain.
"honestly it took my gyno to realize that i needed to see a specialist while my primary doctor pushed aside my test results, my severe weight loss (i had lost over 80lbs in almost 6 months making me underweight but it also had to do with the meds i was on at the time) and then my very fast weight gain. by very fast i mean i put on almost 100lbs in less than 6 months due to a thyroid issue (which was only found out after i got a referral from my gyno as my primary just kept looking at my chart and didnt care about the very sudden weight gain) <br>i barely trust them now and dont want to go back but have no other choice."
💩 🍦 💩 🍦 💩 🍦 💩
Awesome 👍🤣
"Type 2, former fat man. diagnosed at 30! 13 years later, other than diabetes, I'm in the best shape of my life.  I've lost 120lbs, quit smoking, I have a full range of dumbbells, barbell plates, benches, racks, exercise bike (all of which I actually use).  I follow a structured diet (gotta cheat sometimes) and I've never felt better or looked better in my life.  It was the biggest wakeup call of my life and I have zero doubt if I hadn't changed my lifestyle completely I'd be dead by now."
Sure I hate having to get on the scale at the doctor office I hate being considered obese even tho I'm 165 pounds but guess what thats how things are. I lost 35 pounds last year did I gain 10 pounds back sure but a bitch is on vacation 😅 this whole boycotting these words is insane and ridiculous.
"That's a woman, man!"
"800 calories a day, with at least two hours of hard exercise. Or you can just go ahead and die. Which is your choice?"
He is a truly a very big quack
I could break down with the email that he got basically is stating that they do not find him mentally fit and they are requiring him to provide evaluation proof that you are mentally sound and fit. That’s what they’re asking that email.
"I do not know the UK board, but I could tell you this if he wasn’t in the United States I know for sure to Texas board definitely revoke his license here because he breaks every medical code"
"I wish I found this individual long time and if he said that I’m going to spend the rest of my life fighting it, I would reply back. I’m very proud of you that you are not a quitter you’re out for a long fight, but you’re gonna do that without your license"
"Oh God, yeah he deserved to get his license revoked pre-diabetes is not diabetes. Yeah it is the early stages of it. What I like to call it the warning signs basically you’re at the point of no return, but you can turn back."
"Oh God, yeah he deserved to get his license revoked pre-diabetes is not diabetes. Yeah it is the early stages of it. What I like to call it the warning signs basically you’re at the point of no return, but you can turn back."
Being fat is true it’s not a disease. It’s a disorder and what’s a disorder a disease.
I agree I seen two doctors that went to school with what’s funny is this I graduated second in my class. They graduate first year and a lost there license within 10 years. from the board I’m still successful. I cannot to School by legal issues. Why they lost her license just really bad how they lost it.
"Being told you’re obese hurts yeah. But instead of leading a parade to criminalize the word as a derogatory term (it’s literally a medical term), use it as a push to better yourself and your body. Jeezus the human race is fucked if people like this win"
"Until I had my first child I was 119lbs and never moved from this by more than a lb or 2, no matter what I ate. By the time I'd had my 3rd I had ballooned to 245lbs, it took about 18months of hard work and I got back down to 154lbs. I'm relatively happy with that we I won't ever get back to 119lbs not that I'd want to, that's just to skinny."
"Them: my knees hurt, I should go to the doctor.<br>Doctor: your knees hurt because you're overweight.  Lose weight.<br>Them: hOw DaRe YoU!!"
being over weight can cause health problems
"well my fat belly was caused of me eating too fucking much and at the wrong time. I cut that out, lost weight, start lifting some weights, and puff... I am back in shape. Sure now need new pants and T-shirts, and It is really annoying, but look at that my genetic had nothing to do with. I was making fun of fat losers when i was in shape, continued when I was fat, and I am not going to stop when I got in shape again,"
"We call it morbid obesity. If theres no medical reason, lose weight. Otherwise there are consequences."
As an L in the LGBT... I'm ashamed people like this are associated w us. The reality denial is too real.
"Okay, let's stop using the word obese. I agree. Let's revert back to how we called it in the good old days: FAT."
How did this person even become a doctor dear lord…
This GUY is delusional
"There seems to be some confusion about this (former) doctor. She is a transman and weighty human. I wonder if her weight has anything to do with her gender confusion?<br><br>""Dr Asher Larmie (he/they) is a Transmasculine weight-inclusive GP and leading expert in weight stigma. He is a fat activist and the founder of the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23noweigh"">#NOWeigh</a> campaign. With over two decades of medical experience and a lifelong journey as a Fat person, Asher is combatting weight stigma and promoting weight-inclusive care as the self-styled Fat Doctor."""
">There is no evidence that intentional weight loss has any longterm benefits.<br><br>I mean, fat people who live beyond 50 are a rarity, while fit people at that age are a common sight."
"Wow. Before my rny gastric bypass I remember feeling like I couldn't expand my lungs very far. Lost 70kg in a year, doubled my lung capacity. I think organ fat - massively documented - is a thing ma'am. Sorry."
"See, these terms can also just be thrown around. Im in Canada, so I'm not sure how different here than elsewhere. However, Im all muscle from gym and a physical job. Yet im technically ""overweight."" I should be 120lbs im 140lbs of pure muscle. So it really depends on body types. Muscle weighs more than fat. You would also need weight for meds..... so yes, a scale is needed!"
"There’s nothing wrong with being a little overweight but if you are so obese that moving around is difficult, it’s time for a change<br><br>This whole thing gives off Whitney Thore and Amberlynn Reid vibes"
"Michelle, your barbie editing is flawless 😂"
"You know that medical board was throwing a party after that response of many laughing emojis, because now they don't have to go through a bs trial about how they fired someone for wrongful discrimination, now they can wash their hands completely of the windbag and move on with life, done them a favor."
They really be putting any o'l random thang in important job positions aren't they? Just identify as something special and boom you're an expert (or an activist pretending to be an expert). It's no wonder the gaming and movie industries are falling harder than a 50lb 2 year old who haven't learned how to walk yet.... At least the medical field don't allow their crackpots to flourish turning their industry into a regressive cultish joke. Gaming corporations and Hollyweird could learn a thing or 2 from the medical industry.
That shorter haircut makes her head look like a big toe.
Ok then.....
"if you're scared to see your own weight on a scale, you're the one who has a problem with your own weight. doctors record weight at each visit so that they can track unusual weight loss or gain. if you go to your doctor one week and then the hospital the next, and they weigh you at both visits and you've lost 10 pounds in between visits - something is not right, for most people. weight loss is one of the first signs of cancer that people may notice in their daily lives. sudden weight loss is also a sign of untreated diabetes, which is deadly. this is the reason your doctor weighs you at appointments, and during hospital visits. it has nothing to do with your feelings."
"Well congratulations sinking all that money you paid for medical school, down the toilet! Also, for someone who’s apparently so “passionate about changing an oppressive field” you sure buckled like a Jenga tower at being investigated. They even gave you a chance to fight for your license! But whatever, at least he’s not a licensed doctor anymore 🤣"
idk intentional weight loss improved my health significantly so
I think she needs a 5150 (or whatever it is in the UK).
"There use of phobia needs to stop being used for everything people didn't agree with, I'm not scared of fat people i just it kind of sad that they're too lazy to workout or lack the self discipline to eat healthy"
"There's something heinous about getting being a licensed doctor just to lie to people about health and not losing weight. What is there to even gain from that? You're knowingly encouraging the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands of people! Absolutely sick"
Never trust a doctor who looks like that.
"If being overweight has nothing to do with diet like these “Fat Acceptance Advocates” claim, why do they get mad when someone goes on a diet?"
I’ve seen the new Southpark movies lmao they threw so much shade 😂😂
I’m in the uk -ozempic is near on impossible to get - only type 2 diabetics can access via nhs - everyone else has to pay them selves by passing the GP - they (this doctor) is wrong

"What doll is that? Seriously. I need to know. BTW, they made a chubby doll... Yeah... Not plus size yet, but... we're getting there. :/"
I need to gain weight i am 5:4 and 97 pounds
Imagine spending a decade in school + residency to get your MD only to lose your license because you chose to die on the social justice hill that none of its supporters can even climb 😂
"I was a mid-level and learned that there are 2 types of clinicians: one type, who understands that their license allows them the duty of practicing medicine, and the other who believes their license is actually a license to dictate reality and make things up. <br><br>The latter is far more common than most would like."
just by looking at her i can tell she is in the woke cult
"Just use the term ""fatty"" instead of obese"
Theres no such thing as fat around the organs?<br><br>U ever hear of foie gras ?
Dieting doesn't work!!! Lifestyle choices do work. Want to be healthy make the right choices
Imagine having spent thousands of pounds/lbs and years of time for ur doctorate only to have it revoked because u have very stupid and unhealthy ideas that could literally kill ur patients...
"Just how did this freak gain a medical license in the first place? One thing’s for certain.  she could only ever practice, practice, practice ~ because she certainly wasn’t getting anything right. Of course, there’s the old saying, ‘practice makes perfect’ but she seems to have totally failed in that regard. <br>I wonder if any of her victims ~ whoops, sorry I meant patients ~ are in a position to sue for malpractice, having followed the clearly demented advice and suffered a bad outcome because of it? After all, she was charging £200 ($253 USD) per 60-90 minute virtual consultation as a ‘weight inclusive’ health coach(!) so I bet the ‘advice’ given was anything but healthy. That’s on top of her regular salary. An average NHS GP salary in the U.K. is £87,884 ($111,300 USD) There’s no set pay scale for GPs in the UK, the salary reflecting the individual’s years of experience, level of responsibility (irresponsibility in her case), qualifications, and which UK nation they are working in. <br>At least now her license has been pulled, the level of medical competence in the U.K. has increased. Do I think she’ll ever get her license returned? <br>Fat chance….."
"Absolutely agree, I Iive in Thailand and the food temptations are everywhere. Anything you can imagine and much more is here and it's all really good. But I've managed to lose 25 lbs over a couple years by sacrificing, pain (jogging) and will power. I love Thai fried chicken (10x better than KFC) but I dont touch it or any fried food. It hurts not to be able to scarf at will but it feels worse having a gut hanging over my pants. Other give-ups: Indian food, Mex food, Pasta. Maybe occassionally, but staying out of the hospital is higher priority than binging munch-gasms. BTW, hilarious dialogue and brilliant concept--10/10 for you. Comedy gold right here"
"I will say that there are genetic factors to type 2 diabetes as well, but they can be mitigated with a healthy lifestyle, and once you are pre- or diabetic, you <b>have to</b> maintain a healthy lifestyle to have good quality of life in the long-term"

Losing weight causes problems?
Fat acceptance is literally the dumbest things iver ever come across.
"Listen, medication, genetics and underlying conditions will absolutely play a role in weight management. But stating that diet wont impact your weight is just wrong. How can anyone claim otherwise? And i say this as a obese person. Im obese because of medication and underlying conditions. But hey, I also didnt eat right during that time where i gained weight. If i had, my weight gain wohldnt have been so drastic"
"I'm just saying, I had some friends who I grew up with who were obese, and none of them lived to even reach 45."
"someone PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me what the background song is at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=95"">1:35</a> !!"
"I dont think i will ever understand this 'fat positive' movement. There is nothing 'positive' about being overweight. It sucks. It's expensive. It's painful. It is not something to be proud of, and it is not 'beautiful'. These people are absolutely delusional to think being fat is healthy, and i genuinely feel sorry for them. The doctors that dont encourage better behaviors to lose weight/ prevent weight gain are just enablers that dont deserve their license."
"Best way to make sure you let someone know they're fat is have them go on a hike with you. Then tell them ..... Now, imagine something bad happens where you need to flee, who's gonna be victim number one? Usually fat people. I mean even someone healthy with a broken leg can move faster. If you're fat, go hit the gym, eat healthy, and lose weight. I've never heard anyone ever say they regret choosing fitness ever."
Trans doctor.... enough said
Colonist? The nhs was created after world war 2..
"It's not calories itself that causes weight gain. There is a lot more that goes into food that can affect your diet. Greasy foods and sugar are so much worse for you than other healthy alternatives. But they could have the same amount of calories.  And they're not wrong by saying that there are other ways to cause weight gain because medication, underlying conditions, and orher factors do that. What people need is a healthy balance in their life."
"""Spending the rest of my life"" well....about that"
I am obese.  I was 326 pounds.  I am now down to 275.  I plan on continuing to lose weight.  I like being a normal weight better.  I will never accept being fat.
I like your channel. Please do a video on all the fat acceptance fatties that have died from being fat.
Yeah fat around the organs nearly killed me I lost a 100 pounds over 2 years healthy weight now I’m convinced that if I didn’t do what I did when I did I would probably be on disability ( I have rare genetic disorder that effects my organs so weight gain is dangerous)
"Yeah, because obesity doesn’t hurt your joints, among other things 🙄<br>After I began losing weight, my knees felt better and I actually improved my sleep."

Are we sure that dr is a dude?
"Did you say ""He""!?"
I have a distrust for any medicine that helps you lose weight .
Your amazing 👐💐❣
Since I am smoker next time I go to the doctor I’ll say don’t you dare bring cancer that offensive to me 😂😂
"I know this is just anecdotal evidence I have to add my 2cents to that ""dr's"" comments. In Oct '23 my GP was worried about some of my health markers, advised me to make some lifestyle changes and put me on Wegovy. Feb '24 I had my followup visit and ACROSS the board, my health markers had improved DRASTICALLY! I've never seen a Dr giggle at my chart before, but he was so excited at the progress I had made."
When Malcom X warned us about how the liberal agenda was the main enemy to civil rights is this crap right here. Using racism for something u did to urself is disrespectful.
"I just don't get it.  ""Just cause you're fat doesn't mean you're lazy and unhealthy!""  That's literally, exactly what that means.  Now, I'm not going to ask ""Why don't they just stop eating so much?"" because that's like asking a drug addict ""Why don't they just stop shooting up?"" but admitting you have a problem is obviously step one, and if you're so fat you can't wipe your own ass, that should be throwing a red flag or two."
I kinda wish a psychiatrist could Analyze this person and see what’s going on in their brain.
Can she explain to me why once I list 100lbs my blood pressure dropped and I no longer needed to be on medication for it.  I also have a ton more energy and am more active now in my 40’s than I was in the last two decades.   But wait when does all this become harmful to me?
He?
mollycuddled
Thank god this piece of s*** so called doctor has his license revoked. He is a shameful excuse for a doctor and human being.
"I mean, technically they are a doctor because they have a PHD, but they ain't a medical doctor no more lmao.<br>Yeah, lots of things can cause weight gain, but a lack of self-control and motivation is indeed one of them!"
"It is not healthy to be fat. If you’re fat, what should you do? Well first of all stop gaining more. And than maybe speak to a doctor (who hasn’t gotten their license revoked)."
"If I walked into the doctor's office and he was the one who called out my name for my appointment, I would literally walk right out the door.<br>I'd rather take a doctor who was sitting there having a Jim Beam on the rocks and a cigarette than an overweight one. Especially to that level of overweight, where the chins are successive speedbumps, the arms look like they have stalactite, and the belly has a bigger apron than my cooking one.<br><br>He has bigger fat bracelets then my toddler who's supposed to be slightly chubby because he's two. His arms could literally stop him sinking, they are like floaters, so much fat"
and this is why a lot of doctors want to start refusing certain people. my idea of who to start refusing. if as soon as the person uses the word fatphobic that is the cue to tell the person in question. yeah OK i can no longer have you as my patient. you are a lawsuit against either me or the client waiting to happen. you are not going to listen to what i have to say about why you have these problems.
Are they fatfrauduk now?
Why are they so afraid of scales if theyre body positive? 🤔
I think the issue is with common sense. Becoming healthy and mindful of what you put in your body gives you a better quality of life. And your body’s response time to situations increase. To me it seems like they want people to accept their bad habits more than accepting them.

"So I was a long distance cyclist (did the trans Canada ride more than once), but I had to get some pretty serious knee surgeries done. I couldn’t cycle for two years and I went from needing like 7000 calories a day to like 3000 and over night. That coupled with medication that I had started to treat my Bipolar disorder that causes significant weight gain as a side effect I gained over 80lbs during those two years. <br><br>I was like, “it’s not my fault almost everyone would have gained weight if put in the same situation.” But after around a year post recovery from my knee surgeries I came to the conclusion that how I got to this point (and whether it was my fault or not) was kind of irrelevant. When I was trying to plan on how to improve the quality of my life and manage my various medical issues the answer was pretty clear that I had to reduce my weight, particularly for my joint issues. <br><br>Gaining the excess weight may not have been my fault but I would have been responsible for maintaining that excess weight after recovery. Now I am back on my previous weight and I am cycling again. In my opinion, and at least this was the case for myself, saying being overweight weight wasn’t my fault only accomplished making me feel like I didn’t have agency and autonomy over my life and my health. That isn’t true and we can make changes in how we live. It may not be easy and it won’t happen overnight but we absolutely can change our lifestyle and habits."
Just like psychiatrists. Claiming natural emotions to be a disease. Just to sell pills and get dangerous  people out of jail.
Okay I love the doll stop-motion stuff
My lil ham hock 😂😂😂
"Wait, is this doctor trans? You keep saying he, but they look nothing like a he. Like I want to be respectful, but its so confusing when they put no attempt into transitioning but expect people to know their pronouns. I'll call you what you want to be called, But you have to give me something to work with here, or I'm gonna make an assumption based on how you look and act. And you don't look nor act the part."
"the fact that you said ""he"" makes you respect you more."

"Hi Michelle, my name is Jade I'm 15 and I'm trying to start my fitness journey. I am 5'0 and currently weigh 160 and know that I am not at a healthy weight. But I don't know what would be a healthy weight at the same time. I've been told 100, 120, or 130, but I'm not really sure. Plz help (p.s. I really love your videos and look up to you a lot :)"
"Holup, that’s a him??"
The editing on this channel is  bloody amazing 🎉😂
She can still call herself a doctor as she has a Doctor's Degree.
I want to live in the Michelle verse.
"If they are trans, are they trans male or trans female? I’m so confused"
"How about you sign a waver, if you weigh 400 lbs and are convinced you are as healthy as a 180 lbs man, than you refuse Medicare/Medicaid when you develop cancer or diabetes and require tax dollars for healthcare. <br>Are you willing to bet your healthcare on it?"
When I go into my doctor after not going for a long long time. They retake my weight/measurements. It’s just standard practice so they can prescribe the right medication dose for you.
"Why are you calling this person who is obviously a woman he? Come on Michelle, don't pander to these crazies who are obviously using transgenderism for attention. Real transgender people make an effort pass as the opposite gender."
"Getting type two diabetes is not the person‘s fault many times people can get type two diabetes for other reasons other than being lazy and eating shitty for example I developed it because I had gestational diabetes. I’ve never been more than 20 pounds overweight and I didn’t eat any worse than anyone else, so you’re wrong when you say that it’s everyone who gets type 2 diabetes own fault."
"You made me gotta defend fat dummy. <br>Diet means 'what you eat'. It doesn't mean a special type of food, it isn't what you do to lose weight, it's just the food you eat regularly. When people 'go on a diet', they're 'going onto a new dietary plan' and changing the things they eat. So yes, your 'Diet' is exactly what causes you to gain weight, if it's a bad diet. <br>And, biggest benefit of the doubt possible, Exercise might mean 'a lack thereof' in the specific context of that tweet."
"I can't believe they said visceral fat is made up.<br>I study veterinary medicine and literally yesterday I saw the intestines of a horse and they had visceral fat on it's sides.<br>A HORSE, which eats grass all day.

This seems like a psychotic break
The delusion is absolutely insane
I love the Michelleverse!!!!
Not a he
She.
maybe it's because I'm a type1 diabetic but when my BG is high the last thing I want to do is eat it just makes me feel nauseous I just assumed it was the same for everyone I guess not tho
"Wow... That must have been a lot of work, editing the Barbie Michelle. Well done! Great video 😂❤"
"My right knee joint hurts constantly and as soon as I'm over 60 kg, it gets much much worse. I'm bounded to keep my weight under 60 kg if I want to be active. <br><br>How can people trust the judgement of someone that denies its own biological reality? I don't get it."
"Type two diabetes and pre-diabetes are often ""not your fault."" My whole family has insulin intolerance, and we fight every day to do all the things right. Weight training, clean whole foods, no sugar, low carb, lean meats, healthy fats, well balanced, and yet it's still a problem. Some people just won the genetic lottery of crap. However, we all feel 100% better doing all this hard work. It's still like swimming through molasses, so many of us end up on diabetes medication to help maintain all that hard work. If I look at a fast food restaurant, I bloat up, so yeah.....context matters, but you're right about most of it."

"I just had my first apt with a weightloss dr, and it went great😂 it ended up taking an hour and 20min, and i left feeling so good about myself and the future🤷‍♀️ ive never had a dr tell me to lose weight when it wouldnt positively impact my situation. Drs just want to help usually.<br>Also, my weightloss dr actually didnt prescribe me any medication. I brought up my options, but i lost 16lbs between my referral to the weightloss dr, and seeing her the first time, so she thought i was doing a really good job already, and i dont need meds. We talked about my exercise routines and whats best for me, we talked about my diet, and we talked about my physical and mental hurdles. She spent MAYBE 2 minutes talking about my medicine options."
the pronoun changes on that doctor are confusing me. you went through all of them

"Doctors just don't weigh you to make you feel bad, they have to measure how much of a dosage to prescribe according to your body weight. (Please correct me if i am wrong)"
"I understand you're probably scared of getting cancelled, but it's so jarring hearing you refer to this awful woman as He."
"Ive been a type 1 diabetic for almost 18 years. I know a lot about it, but also about type 2. Just cause someine has type 2 diabetes does not always mean they inherently caused it. Excess weight does impact the likelihood of developing it, but its not even a main factor. The biggest factor is genetics. Ive met type 2 diabetics who were very healthy and fat people who werent diabetic. If someone is genetically predisposed to develope it, being overweight doesnt help. But please do not claim any diabetic brought it on themselves. Its medically inaccurate, spreads stigma about an already stigmatized disease, and shames those suffering with it. Also, Michelle for the rate that you talk about diabetes people might start assuming your an endocrinologist. I can barely watch your content because half your videos are just spreading misinformation about diabetes"

"Topics like this are difficult to unpack. It’s true that a good chunk of, at least the US healthcare system, that is outdated and a majority of doctors tend to blame most women’s issues on their weight. It can be extremely frustrating trying to get a diagnosis when doctors aren’t even taking the time to run proper tests. Just like with toxic diet culture, a good thing, like body positivity, can turn sour when people start using it to justify their personal opinions and vices."
These videos are very helpful in helping me to stick to my diet.

Of course this person is trans.....

"Obviously if you have chronic pain losing weight is going to help, because your body will be under less stress. These people are extremely dumb"
If they truly believe that their ideology was correct then they would have never left. They would've stood 10 toes in their shit even at the threat of being investigated 😂
The michelleverse segment is hilarious. Im a semi new carnivore and i love this channel. We need to figure out how to bolster dietary health in our community whether vegan or carnivore.
"Facts over feelings buttercup, real life is hard and yes it can sometimes suck you don't like the truth. That's why you bury your head in the sand. <br><br>These doctors promoting body positivity even on the obese side should have their license taken away for misinformation that can leave others to think they're okay by continuing on with seriously bad choices which will lead to death."
"I understand the issues larger people have with the medical establishment (I myself am very slender but most of my family is heavier)<br>there is a genuine issue with people like that going to the doctor (especially while in the process of getting their weight under control) and having obvious health concerns overlooked because ""just lose weight"" (my partner's aunt has serious thyroid problems that have led to her excessive weight gain far beyond her control, yet when she goes to have it looked at to potentially help the problem and help her LOSE weight shes ignored or disregarded, its honestly quite angering)<br><br>but theres a huge difference between the actual problems larger people face in getting medical treatment, and disregarding genuine health advice and research because it hurts your feelings"
"my best friend is a type 2 diabetic (technically not yet cause my man has kept the diabetese in check!!)<br>hes on the larger side naturally like his parents and hasnt been on any weight loss regimen or anything, but he IS on a diet to watch how much sugar and carbs he eats (hes still alowed to have sugary things just less and watches how much he has)<br>using type 2 diabetese as a gatcha just makes you look lazy, like wow susan, you cant even put down the starbucks coffee for one day? no wonder you've got diabetese"
Choose your suffering: <br>Either diet and exercise <br>OR<br>Listen to lizzo.<br>Choose wisely. Suffering is a part of life. There's no avoiding it.
As someone whose ancestors were colonized… I don’t think feel comfortable with this person looping loosing their license into the plight of post-colonial peoples. I’m not sure they know what colonization means beyond use as a buzzword.

"Commenting on the stepping on scale each doctor appointment thing mentioned at the beginning: even I feel uncomfortable having to see the numbers despite being fairly toned person. I know I'm not in any way overweight, but seeing I am 51kg and not 45kg like kpop idols makes me dysmorphic. I complitely understand the thread of knowing you have to witness the numbers again. Weight fluctuates for everyone and god forbid if it fluctuates upward do you feel shitty."
How did this person get a license to practice medicine????
Drop some pounds…and the T. The delulu is STRONK here.
is that doctor a man or a woman??

"Wait , is this doctor ur talking about a man or a women? U keep calling it, a him and a her....im confused"
He ?????????🇬🇧
"According to that email he has been ""struck off"" it means he can no longer legally practice, i assume you also use that term in the States?"
"The word ""Obese"" it too polite. The term ""grossly fat"" is a much better fit."
Very cute video.  Great concept.  You're amazing.
"Darn it, now I want Cheetos and a good Goosebumps. Also are you sometimes saying she and other times he, or is my hearing bad?"
"like, it is true that the medical system can be unfair to people who are overweight, however, visceral fat does exist, overweight and obese people are more prone to health issues, and it is healthier to be active and to eat healthy."
I just want the BMI scale to be updated.
"I know diabetics who have had feet/legs amputated, gone blind, and died. <br><br>So maybe it’s actually a thing?  😂"
thank you for using his correct pronouns even though she’s.. something!
"I saw in an ObesetoBeast video that this person had tried to lose weight in the past but was, obviously, unsuccessful. They're basically throwing a giant temper tantrum because they couldn't do it. What a baby, if you fail once, just try again!"
💩 just following instructions
"What the absolute—I’m sitting here watching this instead of studying for the mcat. And all I can think is it’s not at all vague what unsaturated fats or triglycerides are or what visceral fat around organs does to you. I’m studying it right now. I literally don’t understand how anyone who studied for the mcat, let alone WENT THROUGH MED SCHOOL, could still think this."
A delusional fat acceptance “doctor” is also trans? Color me surprised
I met someone who was diabetic. They ended up in a wheel chair because of amputations due to being diabetic. Eventually they died not sure if it was because of being diabetic.
You couldnt care less. If you could care less then you do care some.
"LMAO.... This 'doctor'  told me years ago, that  it was no use losing weight, because I would gain it all back anyway within 3 years or so...  And just look at where we are now 3 years later... I haven't gained back and their license was revoked???  🤣😂"
💩
"Dude I'm skinny, and have these same fears as the obese chickies do. I hate going on the scale, I hate the doctors preaching diet culture at me. Over 230 at 4ft, 10in is considered obese. I once had a BMI of 28 at the most, and was called obese.<br>What makes them so special that medical advice is discrimination?"
"The truth is, we just plain didn't have ultra processed foods, fats and sugars in near-infinite abundance until about a century ago. For all of human history, NO ONE ATE LIKE THAT. They literally COULDN'T. Industrial food-like products didn't exist. We're just now REALLY seeing the results of this new way of eating and the results are BAD. I didn't get fat. I just ruined my back teeth, got arthritis in my 20s, and had the WORST case of depression and anxiety that pills could not solve. Guess what fixed ALL of that? Cutting added sugar and ultra processed foods. Sunshine. 🌞 Drinking enough water. Limiting caffeine. And getting enough exercise. Seriously. That was it. The entire time, my diet was killing me. Chances are if you're reading this, it's killing you too. You got this. It IS worth it 💖🕊️✌️"
Is MyFroggyStuff a channel you like? I swear you have that vibe and I love it.
"""you gotta stop using the word obese""<br><br>ok what do you want me to say? Big back blubber built?"
"I see crazy in this ""doctor's"" eyes 👀"
"""Lose your right foot"" eek! cracked me up. Also the doll was a great match as your stand-in."
Omg I love Michelle Verse!! I hope this will be a regular thing! 💕
"Obligatory comment to appease the algorithm! By the way, is it considered proper to call you ""doll"" or ""dollface"" when you're in the Michelle-verse? I don't want to be a plasticist."
"What i dokt understand is why go to medical school for years, suffer through it, go into tens of thousands of dollars of debt just to talk shit like this and lose your licence"
Yeah and telling somebody they have cancer is not exactly great either but do you want the doctor just to not tell you the truth ?
"As of today (20th June) Natasha Larmie is still on the GMC register, with a note that s/he has been given a warning. So either she hasn't formally requested de-registration or it hasn't taken effect yet."
"I love the fact that medical fatphobia is a real problem and grifters are using it to scam people! Truly my favourite thing in the world, nothing says ""I care about fat people"" like taking advantage of them."
"It's about time that dr. Death, had her licence taken!! Who are that trying to convince they are happy.. themselves or us?"
"The ""doctor"" gave some good advice for obesity:<br>""Before you think of opening your mouth..don't..."""
"I had bariatric surgery…and my life has HONESTLY never been the same since! I’m the healthiest I’ve been in 20 years! I feel amazing, I can breath, I can walk, I’m not in pain 24/7, I can shop in normal stores and express myself through fashion now! Yeah it sucks that fashion for fat people just all round sucks. But I don’t have to worry about it now!!"
She looks and sounds like Hannah Gadsby. Well that's a good sign...
The doll is so cute lol
"Maybe the fat  ""doctor"" had a PHD in English or gender studies and pretends to be an real medical professional cause a real doctor would never tell you being obese is fine & dandy."
"As a former morbidly obese person I can confirm that stepping on a scale and being talked down to because your fat does not feel good, makes you more insecure and depressed and leads to some weird eating escalations (at least for me). But what bothered me the most, was the fact that non of those medical professionals ever offered any real help or had suggestions how to lose weight, as I clearly was struggling to help myself. And if the weight gain stems from mental health issues and addiction, those need to be recognized, diagnosed and treated, then weightloss is actually possible. So yeah I wished doctors were less judgmental and more helpful. But that former doctor was just delusional, harmful and outright dangerous. Fat people fear the scale and those lectures, because deep down we know they are right about us. If there were not even a tiny spark of understanding in us we would not feel so afraid and offended. I was fat for decades and know many big people, so this comes from experience. In the end I started losing weight out of a weird coincidence and kept going, slowly but with a strong will. Now after years of struggling I finally got help for my mental stuff and it turns out I have ADHD, which was the reason for some of my food related problems. I am on medication, sober and I can manage my ""snacksidents"". If a doctor actually listend 20 years ago, my life would have turned out differently."
“The fat doctor UK is a TRANS doctor…” why was I not surprised she’d be the “progressive” types
"As a type 1 diabetic for 20 years, it amazes me that a doctor would say that you don’t have to deny your sweet tooth because it doesn’t matter. You can VERY clearly see that diet is THE MOST IMPORTANT THING to controlling your blood sugar, and thus reducing the risk of complications in the future."
Hey a little confused is fat doctor he or she? Because both ger thrown around or do they use them all?
💩
"I literally just finished watch a short on YT where they showed real internal organs of a body and all the visceral fat that was on it. They wear touching it, picking it up and moving all the organs around and everything was covered with fat. You couldn’t even see the heart because it was incased in fat. How is this person a doctor?"
This fake doctor knows exactly what she is doing. She’s a grifter. She knows she can make more money in tiktok pretending to be trans and spewing out misinformation for profit.
Im just saying... all my medical issues have happened since i gained 60 lbs after my mom died. I have to sleep with a CPAP machine at only 28 and have a vitamin D deficiency now so🤷🏽‍♀️
"Yeah, if you cannot stand to weigh yourself you actually do not have body positivity. You actually are not practicing self acceptance. You are in denial about yourself and don't want to know. <br>I'm not condemning having a hard time weighing one's self or just not wanting to fixate on the number, but running away from the reality of yourself hardly seems like personal acceptance."
Oh thank God! It's about time the medical field started fighting back against this maddness. This stupid movement is killing people.
I never truly knew how bad visceral fat is until I saw it irl. It's terrifying what subcutaneous fat and visceral fat actually look like. It's honestly really gross to think about what someone had to do to look like that on the inside.
The barbie chihuahuas are so cute :3
“Fat isn’t real” ah yes my body just magically gets jiggly after wolfing down a caniac combo
"As someone with insulin resistance - amongst a bunch of other congenital shenanigans - I don’t understand how anyone could willingly make themselves ill.  I also don’t understand how that “doctor” managed to get a licence to practice, but I am <b>really</b> glad that they had it revoked.  I’m sure the NHS is truly mourning their loss though… it’s not like it isn’t currently drowning in issues or anything.  😑"
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Anyone else reminded of Miss Trunchbull from Matilda? <br><br>Geez what a con artist. I wouldn't be surprised if he was getting paid off by pharmaceutical companies that obviously make millions of $$ selling diabetes and cholesterol medication to obese patients. These meds cause all kinds of hormonal changes that increase appetite. Her list of cause and effect of weight gain is top tier delulu
"Doesn’t UK have free health care? I know I sound ignorant saying this, but as a US citizen, you think that a country that has free healthcare wouldn’t have anything bad to say about their healthcare system because it’s free. So why would you complain about your healthcare system if it’s free?"
"Wait ✋️  The Fat Dr is a male? I've watched a few of their videos and never for a moment questioned ""her"" gender. I was very confused for most of this, thinking the other Dr was struck off the board. I don't care about who identifies as what, so don't come at me, but I'm shook. I honestly have no idea anymore 🤯"
Omg!!!! The tiny doggos in the Michelleverse!!!!!!❤❤❤
"I'm disturbed it took them so long to strike her off, I can only guess they were trying to treat the obvious mental breakdown this person has had, But they are obviously unresponsive to treatment. It doesn't help me keep faith with UK doctors that they let this person remain a doctor for so long."
Mini-verse is Hilarious. Oh. Love it.
"An unpopular opinion: lean people are actually discriminated against by the doctors. So, I am pretty lean and healthy looking and for that reason my GP never does anything when I come for either a pill check up, or I am ill. I almost died 2 years ago because the doctor was too lazy to listen to me, so I asked for bloodwork, which they consented to me. As soon as my bloodwork reached the laboratory I had numerous calls on my phone that I needed to come to the hospital asap. If I wasn't this insistent I would not be here today, I'd die at only 35 years old because my situation was critical."
Is anyone surprised they're denying visceral fat exists when they don't even believe their own gender?
The michelle miniverse 😂
“He” haha😂
Doc chose ideology over science which she studied and practice for years
I finally found this channel. I've been looking for years.
I'm in the medical field (not to be a doctor) but I've dissected cadavers with students who will be and there is indeed fat around the organs so idk how she just denies that when I'm assuming she had to have the same experience/training to be a doctor
"I was never fat but I lost a few pounds and honestly it’s been helping my anxiety so much!! So yes, weight loss does help. I don’t need statistics, I am my own proof. So it’s mind boggling and sad that these people aren’t listening to their bodies :("
Dude the mini goosebumps?! Can I join your universe? I miss my goosebumps!
"as a bigger woman, ive always believed that health comes first before body. ive struggled with binge eating all my life and half of my body issues with myself were because of things i couldnt do because i was big. running, being out of breath easily, physically being uncomfortable, etc. Im trying to eat healthy, stop binging, exersise more but its hard. in the mean time, im learning to love my body since i cant change it overnight while still being aware that i can be healthier :)"
Why do I just get the sense that Ashmir said all these overly wild statements because deep down he's insecure that he's only a Small Fat and he's trying to compensate? He's like that person that's not really from the hood but when they get around hood people their entire personality becomes a quest to prove that they are Really From The Hood Like Really From The Hood 🤦🏻‍♀️ Lord we pray.
A doctor can not claim that there are more than 2 genders or a male can become a woman or vice versa and seriously hold a licence to practice medicine
Please stop calling this woman he/him. SHE is a woman who is married with children. Her delusions about weight and health are only the tip of the iceberg of her problems.
💩
Imagine being so addicted to food that you like about how unhealthy it is and put your professional license at risk.
great video! cant wait to see more of the michelleverse!
"😂 New subscriber here I have one question, First of all, how dare you? The dolls, the Disney, the absurd, cackling, the DOLLS, the cosplay, the mask, the sarcasm? Are we literally twin sisters? Why did you run away from home? How are we somehow blood related and we’ve never met! You are my spirit animal. Where have you been my entire life? With my entire chest, I love you.❤"
"If it’s not something that needs to be cured, fixed or repaired, why is it labeled as disability in my state?"
I love the Michelle verse!!
"Is this person a ""he"" in the same way obesity is ""healthy""?"
"I do not want a doctor that won’t accept medical evidence to practice, at all."
"I'm just learning about this person. This is like health care people against vaccines! Maybe worse? No, maybe the same. How did they make it through school?!<br><br>I am saying this as a fat person whose dog now is fat😭 Do to me being sick over the winter (the dog part). I'm working on both of us! It is ok to be yourself. But it's important to improve yourself when it's something you can do. What's next? Glorifying poorness? It's terrible people are poor, and it's not always their fault. If said person was offered a job and help being homed and fed, is it wrong for them to take that improvement? <br><br>""They are fine the way they are, no reason to be people phobic! Who needs money? Is it better to be poor and happy, or rich and miserable?"" That's how I see these people. Person tries to improve. Other crazy person gets jealous or something. Crazy person demeans the person who is trying to improve, causing said person to stay in a bad place....🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️"
💩💩The Fat Doctor uk deserves to lose her license. She doesn't realise how dangerous she is. Spreading misinformation by telling people to practically ignore the fat around the heart? I hope she never practices again! Love from London ❤
"""wishing your body was smaller"" Well I started losing the weight again (yoyoed a bit but never got back up to highest) so I ain't gotta wish lol"
Trans and fat activists are the most insufferable people.
"They are shoving their insecurities down  our throats, so they want the world to baby them. Its madness 😒"
It is very dangerous for someone with authority ( like her) to make claims like that. I've seen ppl secondguess themselves over her claims (as ridiculous as they r) solely because she is a doctor and theyre supposed to be trusted. Im glad they got rid of her license.
Ma’am you are hilariousy funny. You got my follow but then again I’m cheap lol
Imagine CaseOh reacting to fat acceptance
"something, something, just letting the Youtube recommender know this is interesting"
OMG I  love the Michelleverse! The tiny chihuahuas! Aaaaa
"We all go on a scale at the dr office. Fat or no. I'm so tired of all of this, but also grateful because I love your videos 😂"
"I empathize (a little) with anxiety over stepping on the scale at the doctor’s, but it can be the literal difference between life-death. <br><br>Anesthesiologists need precise weight to gauge how much to give you so you don’t OD or feel every single cut and stitch during surgery. <br><br>Secondly, I used to take weekly weights for some of my long term patients because their fluids were so out of whack they could experience a difference of 5~ pounds in that time span, which is indicative of underlying issues that needs urgent care."
"I do agree with the sexism. I went to ER the other day after weeks of pain that kept getting worse. The doctor was dismissive and told me it sounds like menopause. I had to raise my voice and demand testing (like really loudly so others heard me) and said NOT everything is menopausal (which Ive gotten from 3 doctors in 2 years)...anyway after testing, turns out Ive had a kidney infection for over a month...so all the menopausal symptoms  'hot flashes"", ""chills"" , ""abdominal discomfort"" and ""fatigue"" were NOT menopause, . Doctors SUUUUUUUCCCKKKK"
I get on a scale at the doctor's office. Everyone does that. They also take you temperature and check your height!!Gosh!
"WHAT SUCKS IS THAT THERE ARE ACTUAL PROBLEMS IN THE UK HEALTHCARE SYSTEM! There ARE racism and gender problems, both cis and especially trans, but the way he goes about it is so anti-science and ridiculous."
"Lolcows make being trans and autistic embarrassing, at least for myself."
"I only know that I, as 180cm male in his late forties,  have less to no problems with my knees with 73 kg instead of 90 kg of weight..... Just wondering, could this be related? Mmmh, just wondering, coincidance? Don't think so😂"
"I love the outro song!!!! Horray it's back!!!! I missed it even tho I also like the ""pick it up pick it up pick it up"" lol"
"If it was discovered today that smoking was harmful, and that it gives you cancer, I can imagine smokers would be like, ""this is all a tobacco phobia"", ""don't ban smoking from public spaces, this is my human right"", ""I don't believe this is harmful, it's all a conspiracy and discrimination and white supremacy"", ""don't call me a smoker, because it hurts my feelings"", ""I was born to be addicted and I love myself the way I am"", etc. blablabla. Just think how ridiculous fat acceptance movement is."
💩
💩
"what is the point of going through medical school if you don't learn something new, or something that challenges your preconceived notions about the body?!"
I'm fat and i don't react as badly as them while in the hospital 😂😂
*she not he
Hearing they r finally losing their license is one of the best parts of 2024 ps please keep the Michelle Barbie as a thing!!!!!!
My husband asked me why I watch a video of a talking Barbie.. i said well this is my weekly source of very important Informations 🤣💁‍♀♥
Lmao love the Barbie insert 😂 your humor and sarcasm is lowkey inspirational.
Discipline with diet (carnivore) and moderate exercise is the key to obtaining your freedom from obesity
💩🎉
I love the Michelle-verse! And the outrosong! Good choice.  An underlying part of it!
"Being obese is healthy,being bulemig is healthy. Everybody knows that. 😂😂"
"“There’s no cure for fatness.”<br><br>Me (who just lost 60 lbs):  “God must just like me more, then. Because I feel much better and my back doesn’t hurt anymore.”"
I am pregnant and my body tells me to eat a cigarette and those juicy pease of a wall...
The fat doctor must of been trained by the same people who trained Christopher Duntsch. If You Know You Know
Still funny girl🎉 diet and exercise is why you're fat. That one floored me
See your doctor as a heavy smoker ....
This delusional person should have never been allowed to have a medical license.
This trans doc making my country look back! 😅I think we should all dismiss information from trans people in general they obviously don't even understand fundamental biology let alone anything else.
Loving THE MICHELLE VERSE! ❤
"Is that person (""doctor"") transgender??? I thought it was a female."
"Omg the doll accessories!!! The cheetos, a goosebumps book!!! And your cute lil dogs! I loveee it! Where do you find these treasures?!"
ah... his? That's not a man... I have eyes.
as a hunter who has been elbow deep in animal organs... I can attest that fat attached to organs is very very true
💩
"How is he supposed to sell his services online if he doesn't hold a license anymore? He's acting as if he can rage quit and continue as normal and because he doesn't recognize the GMC they will leave him to do whatever he wants. If you want to practice in the uk you need a GMC license whether you like it or not, he's gonna get charged with practicing without a license very soon 😂"
"I'm a doctor and I cringe like I've never before listening to this person, maybe because its cringe + anger. The way he just blatantly says there's TON of evidence that being fat doesn't cause any type of harm to the body but losing weight does makes my blood boil, literally every doctor knows how much bs this is and you know why its such common knowledge? Because it's simply true, we see evidence of it every day, his narrative relies on people not doing any type of research because as soon as you look for studies trying to corroborate what he says you'll see everything he says is a lie.<br>The balls on this person to fight other doctors online is astounding"
I'm imagining Michelle changing the dolls possition after every sentence and that makes me laugh for some reason 😂
"Omg the barbie doll holding the mini hot cheetos laughing at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=137"">2:17</a> was amazing lol. the comedy always gets me in these vids. Amazing work as always."
"Mans took a big ol' swig of that sweet, sweet HAES Kool-Aid, and this is where it got him 😂 really, though, of all the people to fall for fat acceptance, the last I'd expect would be someone in the medical field, let alone an actual medical doctor. As someone absolutely in a position to know better, Larmie's peddling of HAES is definitely reckless, at the very least. The UK's doctor shortage must be bad indeed if the GMC was willing to let Larmie continue practising after all this."
He looks like Gypsy roses husband er Ex husband
i LOVE the doll skits lol <3
"My favorite response ever to someone going into long, wordy reasons for why weight gain is caused by everything else except poor diet and lifestyle, is: Ok so if I locked you in a closet for a week and didn’t feed you, you think you’d come out at the end of the week having gained weight?"
Yeah Pre-diabetes doesn't mean you'll get diabetes ... But that's only if you fight to lower your A1C. I had type 2 diabetes. Mine was from the mass amounts of beer I was putting in my system. Once I got sober and tried more healthy forms of eating and watching blood sugar ... I lost it all. My A1C is at 6.0 right now but I still watch it like a hawk. It's the only way to prevent it from coming back.
I LOVE the Michelle Barbie Doll
Lmao did she really said that visceral fat isn't real? There's a whole-ass video on youtube of the autopsy of an obese woman that shows that visceral fat is very much real
"Uh, yes it is. It’s called visceral fat. Where did this chick get her medical degree? Why is the Q community so weird? Also, it isn’t just the medical community, telling them to embrace their fatness. There are a lot of bleeding, heart liberal’s out there, whining about fat shaming and shaming people who shame, preaching acceptance, diversity and inclusion and that includes obese people there’s far too much coddling going on in this world today."
So when I was going in for my gallbladder surgery my blood sugar was high and I was like yea… it has been. The nurse then let me know that a lot of people on kidney dialysis are there for complications due to diabetes. I didn’t even realize I could ruin my kidneys. Terrified me
Ya definitely way out there. Would not listen to anything they say. <br><br>I do agree to an extent there is some prejudice against obese patients as soon as they walk in. I have been brushed off many times and told to just lose weight. (really I had no clue😂) <br> Had a doctor prescribe me blood pressures meds and diabetes meds without blood work results and only said you are fat w. Dark arm hair. I passed out at work bc the meds crashed my system bc I didn't need them.<br><br>But as a doctor you should definitely bring up losing weight for extremely overweight patients. I just don't agree with pushing fad diets and not doing testing first before prescribing meds.
This person would rather spread misinformation and harm other people than admit that there's something wrong with themselves
"as a disabled person ableism isn't mentioned also? that has to be top 3, and fatphobia is not top 3. <br><br>I gained 5 pounds in like a week and I asked my doctor about it and she wasn't concerned at all. There wasn't a bit of phobia of my body and I am a size 14 and my doctor is tiny. Because I am a healthy weight +/- 5 pounds. I went on lexapro and dropped the 5 pounds just as easily. I was concerned I would gain weight but it turns out I eat a lot gummy ropes and sleep a lot poorly when I'm sad.<br><br>Also, weight is obviously related to health and the concerns you are being seen for, it increases your risk for all kinds of things and the doctor has to do more to rule out that you haven't had a clot or cancer when something is wrong because no matter your age obesity makes that much more likely.<br><br> I struggle enough in a healthy size body. You cannot get migraines under control when overweight. I know what having a migraine you can't stop is like, even getting it treated is miserable. I could not bathe myself, I was like a big baby. If my body gave me more migraines I would be knocking on the door of insanity."
Your birthday cupcake is THE BEST!!! So worth the wait.
I was skinny until I got hit by a drunk driver I am 200lbs the heaviest I have ever been I have diabetes fatty liver and other weight issues I am now trying to lose it’s difficult but will be worth it
Omg I love the Michelle verse😂💜
"Sorry is this person a man or a woman, everyone in the comments is calling them a her but in the video she is calling them a he and i am very confused"
People like that seriously make me believe we are in a simulation... like this shit cannot be real..
"Does anyone know the song used in the background at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=100"">1:40</a> ?  She's used it in some of her other videos the circus sounding music"
I'm surprised that being confronted with their fatness is the issue they have with doctors. I'd be more concerned with the fact that some doctors write your complaints off because you're fat when there are actual issues that need to be addressed.
I've never had binge eating issues (except when there's THC involved lol). I tend to eat when I'm hungry but because I'm also on the autism spectrum that means I frequently forget to eat until I realize that I hate everything and everyone to an abnormal degree. I can literally eat just one Dorito or five cheetos and then put the bag away. I dunno if it's good genes or what.
💩
This is just America's problem. No one is this delusional here in Europe
"I'm sorry, I had to pause literally 76 seconds into this video. I have done thousands of autopsies on many, many different species (mammalian and non-mammalian). Fat around the organs is ABSOLUTELY real."
"Ok obese is out too damn fat is in now, engage! I was 340 pounds about 23 years ago, was at 235 a year and a half ago and am at 180 pounds now. Thanks to channels like this that care about health and give good advice I feel better at 59 than I did at 36!"
<i>Finally. I have been waiting for this lunatic to get reviewed by a medical board and that her license would get restrictions OR revoked.</i>  <br>Thank God that the board took it seriously.
Michelle are you misgendering?
we just going to ignore that iStock watermark?
"This person already denies the reality that she is a woman, denying obvious medical truths about being fat, losing weight, etc., is not that far of a stretch. Using ""they"" as a sigular pronoun (when sex is known) is already 🚩🚩🚩"
It took me so very long to figure out who you were talking about because you kept saying he when there was that fat woman doctor on the screen 🤨
"As a person recovering, but still struggling, with an ED I do actually sympathize with people who have horrible anxiety about having to step on the scale at the doctor's office. I always tell them beforehand that I'm an ED survivor and if the number on the scale is even slightly too high for my liking it can send me spiraling back into a full blown dangerous crash diet, like 200 calories a day or less, that can last days or even weeks, so either don't weigh me or keep the number a secret. So I do feel the girl who does not want to get on the scale. Maybe for slightly different reasons, but the fear is valid."
💩
My doctor is fat and she is talking to me that I have an Ed and im anorexic just because I workout and eat healthy 🤦🏻‍♀️
💩
That’s a woman. She’s a wacko. Clearly.
Can you imagine if we applied this same logic to Bulimia or anorexia?
The Hippocratic Oath is a nasty word to this “doctor.”
💩💩💩
"I work in the medical field in the US. I’m NOT a Dr, but the main reason you step on a scale at the doctors office is….wait for it…medication. Most medications that your doctor prescribes you have a kg/mg dosage scale. This means in order for them to correctly prescribe your medication and how much you should take, they need to know your weight. Getting bent out of shape saying you don’t need to get weighed is the same as saying I don’t need my meds. Everything from Tylenol to mental health meds has a kg/mg dose scale. It’s not that deep."
😂😂😂😂 this world is full of cwacks 😂😂😂
"All these people spewing ""fat acceptance"" are just people that lack acountability, it´s easier to blame all your problems on external/internal factors that had nothing to do with you and your choices in life. They just want to live their lives indulging in their addiction and never be taken accountable for what they did to their bodies"
"Their message at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=470"">7:50</a> bothers me because medical misogyny is a HUGE issue, but coming out of the mouth of someone like this along with a bunch of nonsense it invalidates everyone working on resolving this longstanding problem. Also for the life of me I can't figure out what pronouns that thing is supposed to use and I'm getting mixed messages. Apparently trans people will just pass with flying colors once they get to be a human-sized chicken nugget, because obesity lets men and women look exactly the same--a blubberloaf. Why bother with feminizing surgery and test when you can just change your gender with mcdonalds."
"With that acceptance movement It's just a movement to try to make yourself feel better for not having control over your health. When I went from 200 lb to $40 I felt freaking fantastic. I had more energy and stanma and motivation. I felt healthy and I felt strong. I gained weight back and now I feel miserable and as if I can't even jog a mile. Being fat is torturous to your body. I don't want to be crazy skinny and I'll probably never have abs. But I want a healthy weight again and I'm trying hard to get to that. Because being healthy is being good to yourself❤<br><br>Edit: Also just because this doctor's a moron doesn't mean people in the comments can be transphobic. They use the pronouns he/him. It's not that hard to use it. The doctor isn't a she, they are he. Even if I think this doctor is ridiculous and needs to be stopped with their false information. We don't need to be transphobic."
I lost 220lbs from my biggest weight. Back when i was in the 380s i couldnt see my feet. I couldnt tie my shoes without losing my breath. I couldn't walk 2 blocks... I couldn't fit into some chairs desks and whole ass cars. Do i feel better now? Is this body easier to LIVE in?! DUH! HELL YEAH IT DOES. People just want to eat. So eat. Why lie about it being unhealthy?
"funny how diet and exercise brought my dangerously high blood pressure down to normal levels and improved my sleep.  it's almost like losing weight made me healthier, but that can't be true"
Every other video with that format where they zoom in their front facing camera to put emphasis on specific words has subjected me to the most mind-numbingly stupid opinions I’ve heard in my life 💀
Idk why but I'm enjoying the barbie. Makes my inner child happy.❤😅
Just desserts!  😂😂
If they can become a doctor then so can I
I love the “prescribing Lizzo” reference! I laughed so hard when it wound up giving Sharon diabetes 😂
"Diabetic injectables are for the most part still being approved for weight loss use in the UK and would only be available for those meeting a specific criteria, the NHS cannot afford to prescribe them to any and all so...?"
"The addition of the ""Michelle-verse"" makes this channel even more 🤌🏻❤️‍🔥"
"My 10 year old son watched this video with me this morning (yay summer break lol) but he was like ""that was good I can see why you like her"" I was like right I feel like we could be friends if it were real life and he was like ""I could see that, I could definitely see that"" and then off he left to go watch his comfort anime Ranma 1/2"
Where's the pug?  The mini verse needs the pug!😊
sadly there are problems with this but it’s really due to the quality of doctors and a sign you should see a better one if your condition is being dismissed due to weight. this predatory doctor in this video is just as awful. i used to be about 300 pounds (now 125) and i went in with pain in both knees and was told to lose weight and no scans were ordered. years later an MRI revealed i had inflammatory arthritis as part of my crohns and had lost most of my knee cartilage. i’m 27 😒 so i was frustrated with those doctors and sad in retrospect and this is the kind of shit that results in people seeing a “fat doctor”
"So we have to stop the use the word obese and obesity. Those are medical terms. Should we stop using diabetic or cancer? Obesity is proven, note the word proven, to be harmful to the health. That's why it was given a medical term."
"Visceral fat amount is VERY important. I lost 86 lbs and was able to get my visceral fat rating to a 9 :) and is it not worrisome to have an overwhelming amount of fat around organs you need to eat, drink, breathe, and stay alive? <br>I do understand the annoyance of going to the doctor and being told to lose weight when what you have going on has nothing to do with your weight. BUT this isn’t your world and when you don’t fit into the norm you kind of have to suck it up or lose the weight. There are many ways to work around any health things (PCOS) to lose the weight."
"I'm underweight and doctors make me stand on the scale. And then follow up with ""you are underweight, you need to gain weight"".<br><br>That does not mean they are skinny phobic"
💩
💩
SHE! Saying a woman is a man is misinformation too. They are all kinds of delusional.  Saying the truth may get me banned from making comments again bc somehow the truth is hate speech.
"Why are you calling the doctor he and she, is this also a non- binary doc?"
Don't trust any provider who doesn't believe in obesity or vaccinating. 😊
"We need weights in medical not just to track obesity and BMIs, but we also need them to work out medication doses. It's literally part of the math our providers use to calculate that"
"Listening to your videos helps motivate me to keep fighting my obesity. Fat dr demotivates people  and honestly,  him taking hope away from people is likely worse than him just misinforming people."
💩
"That unDoctor is a narcissist, it's so obvious!"
"I work in a doctors office. When I bring patients back I always try and joke when putting them on the scale. I'll say something like ""Ok we're going to start off by stepping on the liar"" or ""Hey, I won't look, just tell me what you want it say"". Had a guy recently try to get out of stepping on the scale saying he was 307 lbs. I told him nope not going to get away with it....he was about 50 lbs heavier. His history showed others putting in 307 lbs on previous visits. That doesn't help him! I get it sucks being obese, but let's not lie about it. It doesn't help you to not be honest."
"Political correctness has nurtured mentali illness into society. Complete detachment from reality. It's socialist politics, penetrating everything and pretending that truth is malleable, adjustable to whatever you want it to be.<br>Clown world. 🤡"
Just for you ❤ 💩
[insert poop-emoji here]
Ofc they are trans
im so confused is it a he or a she
Enjoying a birthday cake doughnut while watching this. These are so delicious now please 🙏 get the lemon back in stock. My husband and I are hooked and now any other doughnut tastes like garbage. Thanks Michelle for ruining any other kind of  doughnuts for us lol yours are so delicious. We’re customers for life ❤️ keep them coming 🙌
"""He"" doesn't believe in obesity... let me guess, she also believes in flat earth, global warming being a hoax, p*rn is good, and vaccines bad? Oh wait, as dumb as all the other shit I listed also is, it's not trendy for pretend leftists (at this point in time...). God these people are a trip and a half. That said, I wish these other doctors who are happy to talk about how anti-science she is about fatness, diabetes, etc, would have the balls/ovaries to talk about how trans ideology is likewise totally anti-science (amongst many other things). I know more and more judgments are happening in europe to try and curb said ideology, but the average doctor is still too scared to speak up even when they know it's bs<br><br>Also... ""fix your racism, sexism, ..."" LOL. Sis, you need to fix your internalized misogyny first before pointing the fingers at others. Actually... you know what guys, you can have ""him"""
"People are desperate to cling to the idea that weight loss doesn't solve anything, but there are so many scientific studies that show the precise opposite. The reason for that is simple: even where an individual has a condition that is not weight-related (e.g. something they were born with) being overweight <b>in addition</b> to that condition is an exacerbating factor 9/10 times, because being overweight is an extra stress on the body. And PSA: many drug treatments have been demonstrated to be far less effective on overweight and obese people, or to have much worse side-effects. This is because the increased dosage required to achieve the same results leads to higher toxicity and/or worse side effects. When doctors suggest weight loss, it's because there's a lot of evidence that it will help with the treatment of most conditions, even if that's only by allowing regular-sized doses of medication to be used."
"Ok since this does bug me. Type 2 is genetic and isn't only linked to weight. I say this because my 90 lbs grandmother had it for about the last 10 years of her life. This is because she became less active when she lost her eyesight. My mother and her siblings are all pre or type 2. My aunt who is as thin as her mom is pre, while my mom is type 2 do to being in a wheelchair."
💩
Oy. The unreality. He this and he that. Nah.
💩
Being obese isn’t real? So… is it my eyesight?
Fat around the organ are not bad...<br>It just keeps them warm n toasty during the winter!
"Just to add, sometimes type two diabetes has a genetic component. For example, my mother was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes while being less than 90 lbs at 5’0” — same with some of her sisters and all of them are size 0’s and 00’s…. But not in the case of the people in the videos you reacted to… that’s def their fault lol"
Omg! I'm loving your doll skits!!!  Keep up the great work!
"Im confused....is this doctor trans? Keep being referred to as ""he"""
💩💩💩💩💩
Lying to someone about what’s dangerous for your health is pure evil honestly
love you michelle you always make me cackle💩🎉🎉
Okay go back to calling us fat since we can't handle the term obese anymore.
I mean the scale this is for everyone……….. not just fat people.Everyone has to do it. So I have no idea why they think it’s exclusive to them lol
She's rejecting biological reality in every way. Delusional.
Ok Mini Michelle laughing while running with hot Cheetos took me out 😂
💩🙈🙉🙊🧑‍⚕️ Went to the doctor in February. He told me I needed to lose weight. Told me to keep my carbs to about 150g a day. Did as instructed. It's June. I'm done more than 30 lbs. I'm turning 60 years of age next week. Quit the excuses. Eat less and move. ❤
It’s a woman. Calling her a “he” is as delusional as denying the existence of visceral fat
I’m currently doing a research project about how aerobic exercise can reduce the inflammatory markers that are associated with type 2 diabetes. A certain amount of weekly aerobic exercise can literally reverse type 2 diabetes….. sooooooooooooo yeah. People like them just use big words to manipulate the narrative and still sound credible….
"Khepri be damned, this “doctor’s” attitude is shittier than Shrek’s stankass outhouse-"
Funny how it's only woman whos on ozempic and men om the mear only that seems a little sexist
💩 I loved that new South Park special!
Call me a bad person but I will have no sympathy when reality of obesity hits “the Fat Acceptance Doctor” in the face Karma will one day come and they will realize how ridiculous their claims were I will laugh and shrug my shoulders as I say “we tried to tell you “
Lost it when the Michelle Doll started cackling
Please take a shower if if your skin is sooty and dark
Thank god they removed her (his? Idk and idc. This is so confusing) license to practice. Now they need to take her our the platform for spewing bs
My boyfriend goes to medical uni and I just... let him decide what I should do and what I should eat and I've never been healthier. So people from medical field are pretty useful. Be nice to them.
"While I don’t agree with the fat doctor UK, I exercised and got a permanent injury.  I did gain weight after it, but it was because I binged out of depression."
💩💩
Fat acceptance movement? More like fat acceptance “roll”ment
"Doctors make everyone,  every visit, step on the scale. Why? Because a change in weight,  in either direction,  can be a clear symptom of something else going on. I had 2 appointments the same week with the same Dr, I was weighed both times, and it's a good thing because it managed to catch something that otherwise would have gone unnoticed until it was potentially life threatening.  They don't weigh people just for the sake of it or to shame anyone.  These people need to get over themselves and actually experience something that they haven't created or imagined for themselves. Must be nice to live in a world where your only problems are the imaginary ones you complain about on the internet."
"I do not understand how anyone falls for this stuff. I am obese and I do not want to be. I am trying to work on my eating habits because they are terrible and long engrained from childhood. But I if lose weight, I can do so much more. I went out kayaking to a beautiful spring with friends today and it was fun, but I can only handle short runs. I hope to do longer runs eventually!"
The Michelle verse is so cute! 🥰
Guess what everyone I had high blood pressure and was about to go on pills until I lost 20lbs and guess what all of a sudden I don’t have high blood pressure! Sure the fat had NOTHING to do with it. 😂😂😂😂
I love the Michelle - verse 😂
"Don't call her a ""he"". Stop with all the delusion..."
💩💩💩💩💩💩
All that work for that license just for you to come out doing stupid shit to lose it🤣😭
He?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=63"">1:03</a> theres litteraly an uncensored autopsy of a fat woman on youtube. Just search for it and you'll see the fat. It's not made up  😅"
💩
Any Video featuring the Mini-Michelle-verse is Best Video !!
I'm so confused. Do you purposely use tons of different pronouns when you talk about trans people? I noticed you did this in another video but I can't tell if it's a schtick or you are honestly getting mixed up lololol. Either way is hilarious.
"the diabetes propaganda in the FA movement is soooo horrifying. i've taken care of numerous patients as young as in their thirties who have many missing fingers and toes already. a lot of them also fight doctor/hospital diets. to add onto that, these obese patients tend to develop COPD and it is AWFUL. we had a ""frequent flyer"" patient (basically means they come in and out A LOT to where the hospital staff instantly recognizes their name when they're in the ER and are being transferred to us). we had a patient who came in weekly-biweekly- and monthly at the absolute most with horrible COPD. he never ONCE followed his diet except for 2 nurses who refused to tolerate his BS lol. he would scream and complain until the kitchen staff literally doubled his portions until they were spilling off of the plate. and yes, all of these people are bitter and miserable, especially the ones with diabetes. if you don't want to prickle your fingertips daily to monitor your blood sugar until they're extremely hard from all of the pricks, diet."
Lol omg i loved thw lottle Michelle doll with two doggies!
"Is there a doctor for this doctor, because this person is delulu."
💩
Why is this person claiming racism? He's Caucasian
❤❤❤
💩
"As a person who has a fatty liver due to other health issues fat around organs is very real, and dangerous."
💩
"I want to lose weight but my life has been as miserable as long as i could remember; I hardly have the incentive to live anymore. I already have pre existing conditions like type 2 diabetes and my mental health nonexistent. I don't have a reason to get out of bed each day. My mother is financially abusive so I never had a job before and she makes it impossible to get one. I had narcolepsy since 15 years of age so I can't drive because of that and she won't allow me to have wifi at home even if I get someone else to pay for it.<br><br>I guess my fear of losing weight is more of if I don't lose a certain amount within a certain period of time, my family especially the ones that ""provide for me financially"" (and I used the word provide very loosely) give me a ton of grief. Also I have been on the same weight-loss journey since childhood and I'm 29. The amount of weight I have to lose overwhelms me into more grief and sorrow. I wished I had better coping skills than eating my sorrows away even now it doesn't give me that warm, comforting feeling anymore. Since I have no income and lost my food stamps back in November; I practically starve myself because I can't afford anything to eat and I might have ADHD or my narcolepsy is mimicking those symptoms and I literally forget to eat.<br><br>I know it sounds like I'm making up a bunch of excuses and I'm acknowledging that I'm completely useless in life. How do I not be so dependent on people who don't give a damn about me? I tried everything I could think of. I tried leaving, therapy, a life coach, seeking employment without my mother's input but nothing worked. It's like the only thing I know how to do is to be a failure at life. I feel like whatever life that was inside me has been beaten and sucked out dry. I feel like my only options I have left is to either end my own life (I can't bring myself to do it so I end up thinking about it all the time) or wait for my abusers to die. Either way sounds god awful. That I have to wait for someone to die just so I can live sounds really crummy. I honestly don't know how I haven't gone off the deep end yet.<br><br>Sorry for the rant but thank you for listening."
💩
I had no idea the fat doctor was a man.
"I loved the barbie dolls, please do a video like this again, it was so entertaining!"
💩
this mentality these people have is so alarming 😭 like there’s so many people like this in the world and they’re having children …
"Appreciate you using correct pronouns/not jumping to misgendering/transphobia when criticizing these people, many other commentary channels do that and it's disgusting. Michelle stay the queen, she know she don't need to stoop down to that shit 👑"
Im L💚ING  Mini Michelle!!!!
Telling people to eat what there craving is like telling an addict to take all the drugs they want. We crave more junk food the more we eat them.
I like the dolls that you've been adding to your skits. I'm glad to see you coming up.  1mil soon!
I love how they always mesh together the whole 👉🏼 insert verb + phobic  mob.
Welp now i know who exactly the ACOLYTE was made for.
"""Fat organs are fake!""<br>Babes, if she actually had a doctor license, she HAD to see cadavers. She wasn't delulu, she was lying for clout and money. Let it sink in."
💩 wink
Fat around the organs is made up?!?! I just had my hysterectomy and the surgery and photos showed it!!!
"Im not happy at my size and I hope to fix that. I almost hit 400 lbs. Im down 60 and hoping I can be under 300 by Oct. I will tell you this, all these fat positive people are out of their minds. It's NOT NORMAL to be winded by ten steps of stairs. It's NOT Normal to sit in a chair and your fat covers your knees. It's Not Normal to constantly be hungry. Its Not Normal to have to ""roll"" out of bed or need help getting to your feet."
"The tiny food is amazing, great work"
A mentally ill person dispensing a mentally ill world view... 😢
Ugh and at all of my prenatal checkups they make me step on the scale… so rude!!! 🙄😆
Y do I like the Michelle-verse so much 😂
"""fat is not real"" bruh, there is so much fat around organs. The fact that we dont pick overweight people for anatomical autopsy is bcs nobody has the time to deal with so much fat."
"Of course the “doctor” who claims that fat is not real is trans, they love denying reality and biology 😂"
"Trauma doesn't cause weight gain, trauma can cause OVEREATING and that LEADS to weight gain. Same with environment and other factors people like to blame. Sometimes people who go through bullying or abusive parents or other stresses and traumas eat their feelings because they can't afford mental health care of there's none available to them."
These people are insufferable.
"Three years from now, instead of having Michelle herself or the Michelle from Michellverse narrating information for us, we'll have Animated Michelle from The Michelling Show narrate for us 😂 Loved the video with the inclusion of the Doll, a nice twist to the usual channels."
i’m loving the michelleverse
💩
💩💩💩💩💩💩
Is this actually real?
He is pathetic really
"""There's no benefit to losing weight"" <br><br>Yeah I'm down 28 pounds, 239 from 267 and I've ALREADY seen a big difference I can walk across a store without being out of breath and tasting metal now. But of course that makes me fatphobic according to them 🙄"
"In other words: ""You can't fire me! I quit!"" With a healthy side of, ""I don't like you so you're bigoted in every possible way!"""
"The outrage from most people who are overweight comes from the fact they haven't been able to find the discipline needed to get to a healthy weight. Yes, some medical conditions can make it harder to lose weight but it's never impossible. I don't judge people if they are happy being overweight, but at the same time you don't get to be bitter toward people who aren't."
“There’s no cure for fatness”<br><br>Exercise. I know that and I’m not a doctor. Even if I was a doctor I’m not going to spread harmful rhetoric as a form of agenda
"TheFatUK, now."
💩
"It’s people like this that say such just brain-dead shit that makes other people not take the LGBT+ community seriously (coming from somebody from the LGBT+, please stop grouping ((ashir not michelle)) us together with these delusions)."

"""Are you a healthcare professional?"" <br>""Nope, and neither are you."" <br><br>😂😂😂😂"

"I think getting angry on camera is the only exercise these people do, I say let then do more of it, it also gives more content for us to laugh at, its a win win 🤷‍♂"
I’m in pain because of a medical condition I was born with. It is a FACT that obesity makes it worse.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=146"">2:26</a> Um, mini-Michele seems markedly less buff and cosplayey; but we don’t body shame her for that."
The first moment I heard this person speak I knew they were not mentally stable. Everything that comes out of their mouth is delusion.
as a fellow brit we do not claim this person
"""fat around the organs is not real."" Ah, a huge X to doubt. I have seen it when I watched an autopsy with my own eyes. I am glad she had her licence revoked."
hit you with that du du du dud duu
"This “he” is killing me. Lol That is a woman. There, I said it. lol"

She literally said you can’t fire me I quit
"I never understand why people say weightloss is bad for you or harmful, im not obese but i am a bit overweight and stuggle with a binge eating disorder so i decided to go into a calorie deficit, and its helped me so much with prevented my binging and the weightloss has made me such a more confident person, i feel healthier and its the best ive ever been mentally. Demonising weight loss is seems so harmful especially since vulnerable obese people will see these posts and think its healthy to be morbidly obese"
"Hey when I heard I was overweight  for my height, I didn’t get pissy and be like stop that, I worked out changed my food habits to lose weight, and I did I took 6 months but I did it."
They weigh everyone at the doctor... It's just a thing they do!!!
You mean she?
Why are these people so hard-headed to understand truth? Being delusion is also very common. Also being very hypocritical towards people in the same statement.
"You can’t be a healthcare professional while ignoring evidence and science of health. At that point, you’re a poser. You’re just larping. You’re playing dress-up."
"As a <b>gasp</b> THIN I have gone through the first clip. I have Blau syndrome and that can (and probably already is) cause neuropathy, cataracts, uveitis, and glaucoma. All of those are usually caused by type 2 diabetes. I don’t eat perfectly or anything and constant joint and muscle pain make it hard to exercise when I run out of advil but I definitely don’t have diabetes. So to hear a doctor say “all we can do for now is have you eat less and lose weight.” Is pretty infuriating because I know, and the doctors know, that I don’t have type 2 diabetes but that’s all they can do because it usually works."
💩💩💩
"Dysgenic, m entally i ll, J troon is telling people to be degenerate. Imagine my surprise."
How did she graduate. Medicin School.
People are waking Up
I think this “doctor” used google and chat gbt to pass the classes.
"Type 2 diabetes isn’t 100% your own fault, that is not a fair narrative ‼️ Sadly there’s a huge rise in “normal weight” people developing type 2 diabetes due to either genetics, stress or environmental factors but we’re not sure why yet. Yes, the majority of type 2 diabetes patients are still obese and need to change their diet! ☝🏻 But it’s not as simple as just saying “everyone with type 2 diabetes caused their own demise”. Sincerely, a clinical dietitian working in the research field of diabetes unlike the clown “doctor” in the video 😭"
"""FAT AROUND THE ORGANS IS A LIE""<br><br>Autopsy of obese woman: <b>clearly shows fat around the organs (which are also enlarged)</b>"
"Ah yes,<br>   My favorite source of second hand brainrot has posted"
Didn’t know about the pronoun change. I appreciate you. <br><br>The doll edits and skits are great but I missed how expressive you are in this video. <br><br>Ty for the great content
I’m not obese and I’ve stepped on the scale every time I stepped into a medical facility even if it’s just a clinic
glad she lost her license
Omg the tiny plastic puppiessss!🥹😂
"I was one of the (presumably many) people who filed an official complaint to the GMC regarding this doctor around two years ago. So yeah, I'm pretty happy they quit lol."
You can be born with a condition that causes you pain and carrying excess weight would exasperate it so yes lose weight to help ease that pain. It’s not an attack it’s common sense.
"When I crave a cigarette I don’t deny myself and don’t ever tell me that it cause cancer and if I get it, it’s all my fault.<br>Stupid doctors."
"Oh FFS.  I never realized how crappy I felt until I lost weight.  Now, I would never look back.  My doctor waited for me to be ready and then sent me to the right people.  They are there to help.  This doctor would not help, because they are clearly insecure about their own struggles.  Imagine losing your career for this?  What a shame."
Being fat isn't made up.  Race is though.
"I have to go on a scale whenever I see my neurologist here in Ireland along with taking my blood pressure. They’ve caught other underlying issues just by doing that. I have a very unhealthy relationship with weighing scales so I just look up and they take down my weight. It’s normal and happens at every doctors appointment! My mother had diabetes but she kept eating so much sugar to the point it developed into type 2 diabetes which was completely her fault. Buying a giant cake at the shop and hiding it from my dad and eating it in secret. They never want to take accountability! I actually have muscles in my legs now from working out and it makes me feel so good. I’ve never been obese, only slightly overweight when I was younger and I think life is too short to not have that cookie but at the same time, don’t have fifty cookies 😂 love you Michelle!"
I can't believe anyone would be involved with this toxic movement us health and fitness freaks need to come back big time and get rid of this toxic movement once and for all
"""Obese, mid 17th century: from Latin obesus ‘having eaten until fat’, from ob- ‘away, completely’ + esus (past participle of edere ‘eat’).""<br><br>Real word with its own Etymology.  So we will use it whether you like or not."

Mental health...
Im busting my butt to drop 5 lbs in a week after a single cheat day ruined 2 weeks. 400 calories a day for a week and I... WILL... WIN.
They're really letting these crazy people be doctors?..
I thought my fatness was hormonal. Turns out i wasn't drinking enough water. I am able to lose the weight now and because of the water i look a lot better
That doctor used to post content trying to lose weight 😂😂 but then switched her tune and screwed up her career!<br><br>Loving the Michelle Barbie ❤
Nothing like the delusions of other people on the internet helping you feel better about your own sanity.
I love your Barbie story times ❤
💩
"The fat doctor is a woman, “trans” just doesn’t exist"
This is beyond parody 😂 bloody hell.
"Who’s “them”? How many of them are there? I thought there was one doctor with revoked licence.<br>Who is he? The revoked doctor is a woman, is there another doctor with revoked licence?<br>Is this why “them”?<br>I’m confused. 💩"
This woman is seriously unwell. She needs therapy!!
Dr lunatic has lost the plot 😂 we don’t want her representing the UK 🇬🇧 🤦‍♀️😂
"No, Not all diabetes 2 is someone's fault. There is diabetes 2 LADA, which has to do with an immume reaction. My mum has it and she got D2 when she wasn't even overweight."
❤❤❤
I mean I get acid reflux as a somatic symptom of anxiety. But I definitely feel better physically at 160lbs than i did at 210lbs.
I'm loving the Michelleverse 🥹
I want to move to the Michelleverse. It sounds like the best place to be!
To be honest I really hope Michelle does a video of the South Park episode because that special is right up her alley of commentary. Plus it was one of my fav specials.
In defence of people going to doctors.   i had a gastric sleeve because i was so big @ age 19  because the dr who performed surgury to remove MRSA and cellulitis told me i should.     turns out my body was storing fat to save itself because of the MRSA and cellulitis  and now im in a world of health issues.
"Michelle: ”we need to protect your precious brain""<br><br>Me: <b>suspicion that Michelle is a zombie who wants to eat brains 📈</b>"
Ive never been weighed at the doctors. (Uk here)
This planet ..... i swear...
it's not a he. It's a deluded sad and very toxic woman.
"Fat around organs is very real. Fat deposition is a way to store energy not immediately needed in regions like the cheeks, breasts, thighs, abdomen, some organs like the kidneys, liver and so on. Women do have fat pads in regions like the back too, to serve as cushioning for carrying a child(supposedly). Its a normal physiological process. But when the body keeps recieving more of it and the levels of activity drop, the body has to store it because it doesnt need that and can't let it circulate. Uncontrolled, this can lead to pressure on different organs like joints and internal organs, deposit in regions like the forehead and when everything fails, fat accumulates in the blood vessels (causing CAD or PAD) or increase risk for a fat embolism as a result of conditions like fatty liver or an orthopaedic injury. Uncommon but fatal. I can list many more complications of being obese but these are the main ones off the top of my head."
I went from 193 pounds to 150. I think weight-loss is possible.
"The unfortunate part is that this isn't gonna wake anyone up to reality. He's a martyr now. ""They're trying to suppress and oppress!"" and all that 🙄"
There are literally videos on YouTube of cadavers with visceral fat.
She is basically unethical ; Doctor being a noble profession shouldn’t be made personal and should be strictly stick to studies and researches.
From where she has done her medical degree😮Doctor seriously🤮
love the dolls 😂❤ please make it a reoccurring thing

"So the fat doctor got the title revoked....is she now just...""the fat""? i think thats hilarious"
"Hi Michelle, just wanted to let you know I started working out daily. I started skateboarding a week ago and although it's a work out it's a lot of fun."

"Was fat doctor Uk always trans? I don’t remember, is this new knowledge? Just wondering"
is it a he or a she?
"Ok, I totally love the barbie set!! 😂💕<br>I hope you're healing well, Michelle!! Love your content, you make me laugh AND you inspire me 💕"
A woman who thiks she can change into being a man also thinks weight loss is harmful and adipose tissue doesn't form around the organs. AND she's American AND she's a doctor. Yep. That checks out.
"Love that Michelle called the doctor ""he"" half the time 😂"
"Personal question... does your butt burn when you've eaten some flaming hot cheetos? I swear I hear my butt yelling ""no more cheetos"" whilst on the toilet."
💩 for the algorithm & a sh*tty doctor.
💩
"Michael, love the channel. Doctors will even sometimes prescribe very specific diets that are not related to diabetes or weight loss. Look into Interstitial Cystitis & urinary incontinence. <br>If somebody on the body positive community had these conditions and went and saw a doctor they would be horrified at the diet!"
10 years of education and a great wage scrapped for mad rambling courses that will make them around £50 a month if there lucky .<br><br>They went from being an actual doctor to doing basically the fat white girl version of QAnon just random conspiracy theories and wild opinions.
lol thefatdoctor making sure doctors always have clients .....obese is like healthcare's main client
fune
I'm 55kg and my routined Rheumatologist visit includes blood tests and checking vitals such as  my blood pressure oxygen and my weight is checked as well and monitored whether I've gained or lost weight especially being on medication to treat my autoimmune illnesses. I've never been to any doctor and my weight isn't checked and I'm not overweight and on the smaller side.. The doctors telling these fat people to step on the scale isn't targeting them. Ya'll ain't special and that's done to most if not all people. I even went to do an ecg the other and the lab tech checked my vitals and weight to add those info to my report.
I enjoyed your doll stop-action. I can’t believe you found mini dogs like yours. That was the cherry on top.
Haha! Love these videos
That’s a woman. They/them/hfournwbfkaduwowje is the thing that doesn’t exist
You played The Song at the end!<br>THANK YOU!
"these kind of people in TT should be avoided at all cost! using delusions and personal propaganda for the group on medical facts are highly concerning and dangerous!<br><br>btw, I love your presentation and style there 😁👍🏽"

The Michelleverse is popping
He?
"There's 2 Ytuber that I'm watching. Both were obese and unhealthy: Dashie went to the  they told him that he had fat on his organ. After his checkup, he throw all his fat food in the garbage and started going to the gym. From 3 years ago, look at him know! Health and have more energy.<br>The other Ytuber Jasmine is doing gym video. She lost 150 lb and more. She's healthy and happier. Big difference for those delulu Tiktoker!!!"
I miss seeing your face and expressions. 😭😭 Barbie is cute but your reactions makes it the best
"I'm all for fat acceptance, but not for fat enabling. Meaning, you're not suddenly become special just because you're fat, you're just accepted as part of society. If you do something harmful for society, that means you're also can be punished."
"You know, I ain't even mad that I just watched a Barbie doll of Michelle save me from rotting my brain...lol."
There’s a point where your too mentally ill to prescribe.
"What do they mean ""visceral fat isn't real""? Have they ever attended an autopsy? Or a surgery?"
The EHEHE while running off with the hot cheetos ended me 😭
"There IS a God!  She never should've had a license in the first place with all the harmful, deadly information she spewed!  This is what happens when you get your ""license"" from the back of a cereal box."
Why does this medication work? Because you lose your appetite.
love the miniverse!!!
"Your Barbie makeover is awesome! Love the media approach. <br>Now, let all of us sit back and wait for fat doc to be hospitalized for complications of obesity."
Ozempic is for diabetics not for fat arses to lose weight do it the old fashioned way I was 120kg my doctor said I would die before 30 if I didn’t  change I had fatty liver a enlarged spleen and pancreas and also a massive stone in my gallbladder I’m now 68kg I went on a strict diet of only salad vegetables and chicken I had Greek yogurt in the morning lunch I had a cup of soup and dinner was the chicken and salad I lost 60kg within a year I got lose skin since I lost it to fast but if I didn’t lose it fast I probably wouldn’t be here typing I do an hour a day each day on the exercise bike and rower machine if you need help to lose weight don’t take ozempic take( SAXENDA ) a medication that is for weight loss and not taking it out of the diabetics hands ❤
What the fuck how many people has she told all this to????
"I don't  like, that the Barbie is talking. I like videos there is the Michelle  Talking.<br><br>I saw these body slices in the ""Body"" science fair. It's  so shocking.  Everyone should  see that, viceral fat is real and it helped me to stick to my diet. I don't  want viceral fat crushing my preciuos organs."
💩
I was pre-diabetic at 14. It absolutely was my fault.
"""At least you're still fat, you have that going for you"" that was art"
when you called them he my brain malfunctioned... they straight up sound like a woman.
"Shes saying to eat what your MIND wants, not what your body needs or wants. Sugar/food addiction is soooooo hard to over come because my brain begs me to indulge and consume all that it’s craving, it’s hard to deny those cravings. It’s easier fkr these people to build a delusional world where their addiction to food isn’t life threatening, dangerous or even real. It’s easier to live in denial than to face the ugly truth that they’re eating themselves into an early death and change their life style. They’re so aggressive and hateful because the delusion is fragile and they depend on it in order to not spiral. Its a mess of mental health issues and I feel bad for these people to be honest."
My doctor prescribed me trulicity to help me lose weight. I don't eat a lot and I have been exercising. Hopefully it helps.
You deserve 1mil Michelle! Let's goo! 🔥🔥
No cure for fatness 😂. The most ridiculous statement I’ve heard. I’m glad they got their license revoked. Makes me want to attempt medical school to work towards disproving these nutters.
"Well now that her license has been revoked, she could likely make a killing hiring herself out to right wing media outlets as the poster child of what the left does to you when you actually internalize all of their ideas."
"Whenever people talk like this doctor, discouraging self-improvement, the only thing I hear is ""misery loves company"". 🤷‍♀"
💩
While Type 2 diabetes can be your fault it is not always your fault.  You can eat your way to Diabets Type 2.  But not everyone who gets it has done that.  It is not always sugar that causes it.  I don't eat alot of sugar nor have I really ever.  I was born with Hypoglycemia and not being diagonsed as a child and having a mother who starved me caused me to have sugar imbalances and insulin resistance. It took a very long time to get to prediabetes and I have been batteling predaibetes for 15yrs now.  I am doing everything I can to keep from getting full blown Type 2 Diabetes.  I keep my blood sugar in as much check as I can.  And correct my sugar as soon as it drops too low so that my body insulin resistance does not get worse.  And you can actually get Type 1 at any time.  You do not have to be born with it.  It is just more common to be born with it or get it at a very young age.  It has to do with your pancreas and liver.
"Has that dimwit never seen and xray, CT, or MRI ever??????  It will show the fat around the organs."
"I dont get what these people dont understand. I lost 50 lbs, and my knees do not hurt the way they used to, but the fat caused issues that I have to live with. My left knee keeps almost giving out, dont get me wrong, HS sports didnt help my knees, but the weight made it so much worse"
Its trans people like this that make all of our community look bad
You should call it minichelle verse lol
you know what else isn’t real? being trans/nonbinary…
💩
First time I saw someone cover something on the “fat doctor” I thought it was some bullshit comedy stunt. When I realized this was a real thing and this person was serious I took 100 pegs down for humanity 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️
🟤
Here's my 💩 emoji lol
Why do they care about stepping on a scale if they accept themselves just the way they are?
"I want to hate her, but.....she's so confused, guarded and angry. She's to be pitied."
Doctors can’t stop using medical terminology because it is a universal language that doctors speak all around the world. One doctor on one side of the world can communicate with a doctor in another part of the world even if they don’t speak the same tongue.
"I'm diabetic (type 1.5). My cravings are so severe I will eat until I vomit and then eat more. My body tells me to eat constantly because I don't absorb the energy into my cells and so I always feel hungry. If I ate ""intuitively"" and ""listen to my body"" , I would eat myself into a literal coma (I've been in a coma from ketoacidosis before). It's a shame this person calls themselves a physician, they're going to kill somebody. And yes visceral fat is a real thing."
"I have high cholesterol and i think this guy is an IDIOT. I may have no self control about food, but am I gonna complain and ask for accommodations if i gain weight? No. I’m gonna suck it up or work out 😭"
Can't wait to check my weight on Monday.  I worked out a schedule walking a mile uphill every day and eating normal meals. Most of the ladies here in butte Montana have amazing legs cuz the town is basically one big steep hill.  I have only seen two people here over three hundred lbs.  Most women here have muscles.  I'm so happy!!
"I lost 20 pounds in three months this year, in a conscious and intentional act of fatphobia.<br>Cut out meat, dairy and alcohol, tracked my calories. Moderate exercise.<br><br>It felt good to disprove so much of their nonsense"
Michelle getting into dolls is one of the best things 😆
"I cant w the argument these ppl use that the doctors only reason for wanting their clients to loose weight is a general hatered for fat people and not due to health reasons. Honey. Doctors dont give a fuq about how you look or how you are precived by the general public.Their only job is to keep u physically healthy, be professional and to not loose their job. 😭😭"
I'd love to visit the Doll Universe 😗
"Nothing to see here, just an obese Dr. telling his obese patients that they are not obese."
❤❤❤
The new medical term is adiposity based chronic disease.  No one should be using the word obesity anymore.
I've been WAITING for this!
"I came here to hear about some dumdum getting some consequences, but I got my world rocked with that pic of Tammy. I know I don't keep up with much, but DAMN I had no idea she'd lost so much weight!!! She looks like a whole different person, and I'm so happy for her!!!"
💩
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩 nine poop emojis for her nine laughing emojis
She! She! She!
"Fatphobic is the dumbest, most ridiculous term Ive ever heard and the funny thing is its not even being used correctly  by those throwing it around. People arent ""afraid"" of fat people or even of being fat themselves- people are sick of obese peoole demanding special status as a ""marganalized group"" with all the specual treatment that entails based on a condition you brought on yourself and one that could be addressed with nothing more than EFFORT.  We wont be gaslit."
There's a mortician that I follow and he's shown cadavers with fat around and in the organs. Ive also watched an autopsy of an obese person that died of a heart attack. Fat around the organs is a real thing that will kill you. I don't understand why these BP people worry about being weighed if they're comfortable with their body.  The number on the scale shouldn't matter.
What a crazy woman. SMH
Ngl I like the Michelle ‘verse
"Great video except one thing. There are people that get type to diabetes and it is not their fault. I am a type two diabetic and have been since I was 15. For years, we didn’t know if I was a type one or type two of how young I became diabetic. Only when I was 41 did they figure out that it’s two but it acts more like type one and it’s genetic."
You had fun with the barbies huh
"I’m glad I just found this channel, wish I found it sooner. Love your content, your delivery. It’s honest and humorous. Looking forward to more content!!🎉"
"I am not overweight—right in the middle range of “normal” (whatever that is)—and I always, 100% of the time, decline weighing at the doctor. I only do it if it is relevant to amount of medication (like anesthesia). No doctor has ever said anything about it. I just don’t like to be weighed!"
I LOVED THE MICHELLE-VERSE
Lmaooo I like the Barbie with her Cheetos
"In a time where everyone us screaming about freedom of speech, we sure aren't allowed to say a lot. Taking words from the english language isn't making the issues disappear"
"Ok, this has been bugging me for a while. In the outro song, is that Michelle singing???"
Reminds me of the woman who went in front of Congress insisting the covid vaccine made people magnetic.
"I don't understand, if they embrace their body then why do they get butthurt when doctors point out what could happen with their large bodies? It's like everything they say is only projection! And that they don't actually love their body, because if you loved it you wouldn't feel the need to say it and just be comfortable and confident. But they embrace their fat bodies but if anyone reminds them that they are fat, they get upset. Does anyone understand that?"
The michelle universe is great. with the doll.
FatDoctorUK literally said they'd rather be <b>diabetic and happy</b> than losing weight and lowering chances of diabetes. Do you actually know <b>anyone</b> who's diabetic and happy about it???
"My boyfriend that’s a doctor said the fat acceptance movement has been trying to change how they work and their entire argument is you won’t die immediately because of obesity, but they are ignoring their quality of life and the struggles that come with obesity. These people need to focus on real issues"
"Do you know it’s really fat phobic? Telling someone they can’t work out and that it’s not worth it just because they’re fat. That’s literally the statement they’re putting out. The statement that most of these types of people put out. “ it’s not your fault you’re fat but it’s not like you can lose it. I mean look at you you’re fat so no point in trying I mean it’s not like we’re lazy but why even try “ or “ food doesn’t make you fat but we’re gonna eat more food because food does make you fat and we gotta show it to the haters” it’s literally clawing their insecurity. All these people are insecure because confident people don’t speak this way all they do is complain all day about every aspect of their life. and people who are“ proud” of themselves, don’t act like this. They can never recognize any type of issues that come with it because they’re not proud because if they were proud wouldn’t they have no problems with that & embrace it with open arms but no, it’s immediately like shut all down because they’re not happy. happy people don’t have eating disorders"
💩 ❤
"I don't disagree that all those stuff CAUSE the weight gain.  Like trauma & stress can cause eating.  Depression can cause laziness. But it's not moving & eating too much either way.  That is the MEDICAL & physical cause. & the treatment is eating healthy & exercising & go to therapy if those are your issues.  If you're genetically stocky like me, YOU CAN STILL LOSE WEIGHT."
"I am clinically obese (according to BMI) and definitely overweight (I'm a 32 y/o female, 205lbs at 5'8"" -- with my lean muscle mass I should be around 165lbs - 170lbs to be out of the risky weight range). I have had health issues for a long time, even when I was a healthy weight. HOWEVER. My weight makes them a LOT harder to manage and certainly makes my life more challenging, particularly being in pain all the time. So yeah, my weight RIGHT NOW isn't why I'm sick, but it is not helping. I started at 213lbs and I am down to 205 😊 and still going."
"Not me screaming  when u said ""little hammocks ""☠️☠️☠️"
They realise doctors aren't weighing them to tell them they're overweight. But that's usually a side effect of nearly breaking the scales... it's for prescriptions.
Dark chocolate Milano's.....YUM! I haven't eaten one of those in years!
"<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/b8IfY7zOK9iVkNAP_I2A-AY""></a>💩"
Oh my gosh I love the doll inclusion. It’s so funny 😂😂🤍🤍
If they believe being fat is healthy and beautiful why are they so scared of stepping on a scale?
"Instead of FatDoctorUK, how about FAFOUK - as in eff around and find out?"
It’s crazy to me that this person has a job in the medical field to begin with 😀
She originally wanted to become a  well-known as a great weightloss doctor! There's a video on the internet
I'm British and this makes me SO happy.
She went absolutely insane.  It's sad.
Ok I just wanna say something why do people say diets don’t work because I can’t eat fat since I was born because my illness and I don’t eat healthy all I eat is sugar and I’m 115 pounds at 16 and never been fat because I can’t eat fat so fat free diets do work I just don’t think it’s healthy because I have to take this stuff and there’s a bunch of worries because your body needs fat but can people stop lying and admit if u stick to a diet it will work
"Mfers out here trying to make ""obese"" a slur, like, what!? Get offline"
Screw it I'm going to start calling businesses short phobic.
"Can obese white people please stop comparing ""fat phobia"" to racism please? It's overdone and exhausting."
That doctor hates herself. She claims she’s trans but clearly still presents as a woman. She’s a bitter person who clearly has a personality disorder.
I love the miniverse☺️
Do these people know that doctors weigh us so that if they prescribe a medication they can give us the proper dose??
"I love the mini Yoshi, Butters and Rigby toys!"
"Willingly giving up her medical license so she can continue to give ""health* advice with no repercussions from Hippocrates. Now that's what I call avoiding ethical dilemmas."
I work at a hospital and we do a depressing amount of amputations. Most of the patience getting the amputations are about 400+ pounds and usually diabetic related. The ones that are not it’s usually an ATV accident.
I'm still confused.  Is this a he or she?  A man or a woman? What is it?
Intuitive eating only works if you are eating foods that are whole foods. It's really hard to over eat healthy foods like baked chicken vegetables and fruit.
so did they transition to she or he?
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=128"">2:08</a>  The Mini-Verse!  🤣🤣🤣<br><br>All-you-can-eat Cheetos & no need for a bra = Heaven!"
Why do these fat influencers always film their tik tok s so damn uncomfortably close to their face😭😭😭😭
"She is dispicable! She has found a vulnerable target audience, feeding them lies which she as a medical professional does very much know to be wrong using her medical degree as proof that she is right! Who ever is questioning that is racist/sexist and all the other -isms and -phobias just to diminish their expertise and to attack their characters. But what she actually does is capitalizing on these people who need real medical help because she is selling masterclasses, courses, seminars etc. to them. She has no morals or ethics and they absolutely should take her license away!"
More Michelleverse 📢📢📢
"You absolutely have fat around your organs, unless you are seriously underweight.  It's very important to have that fat layer to protect your organs and to help you stay warm.  Even slender people have it.  You just shouldn't have a lot of it.  I'm glad they no longer have a medical license."
"Omg, I loved this video! ❤"
"The only made up thing is her entire personality, contrived!"

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtDOIfELaAo&t=19"">0:19</a>... I'm about 145 pounds at 5'10"".<br><br>Every time I go to the doctor I have to step on a scale. It's just part of going to the doctor. Just like your pulse and blood pressure."
She has to be getting off on this. You can see proof of visceral fat on cadavers in an entry level anatomy class.
"I was waiting for a ""and it's fantastic"" when she said ""because I'm plastic"" 😭😭😭"
"The opening thing. Like, yes, there are issues that can be with you your whole life regardless of your weight, but being bigger sure as shit ain't going to help those issues."
Are they a he or she because you can’t seem to make up your mind constantly switching throughout the video 🤦🏼‍♀️
did he geld himself?
"Triple-positive ductal carcinoma is definitely linked with obesity. Both of which I have. Been obese for most of my adult life. I was doing well weight-wise when I was dx with the cancer at age 40 in October  2023. Gained a lot of weight during treatment because fat brain be fat brain. But I'll be damned if I don't buckle down and manage the one thing that IS within my control to try and prevent it from coming back: getting my weight back under control. I may be fat and sick, but I'm not stupid...like this former doctor."
"Not only is that thing a fat POS and a disgrace to the medical community, but is also one of those transmission things? Fucking lulz"
Yeah they make everyone get on the scale because when they prescribe medication it's often dosed based on weight
She.

I’m loving the mini-Michelle-verse! Sooo cute and creative! ❤
slay for still respecting their pronouns/gender identity
‘he’? are her pronouns he/him?😂😂😂😂
I love the miniverse.
I went from a bmi of 46 to a bmi of 32 I’m so happy I finally listened to the doctor
Love the michelleverse! ❤
I missed the real Michelle 😢
You can't fire me i quit
Her delusions run thick
I want to live in the Michelle-verse
That's one beady eyed creepy creeper. 💩<br>Love the outro song ❤
We're using he/him for women that don't even bother to transition now?
"Is the whole idea of been fat doesn't effect health<br>is the new smoke is healthy ?<br>I mean when doctors suggested people to smoke, because it's healthy"
I'm sorry. The use of the doll is hilarious. 😂
"I have a friend that has been obese her whole life telling me some really concerning stuff like that some people have just a natural tendency to be larger, that her body is just that size because is programmed to be that way, other times she also tells me that she feels like she's not supposed to be that way, that it's because of her parent's divorce (mind you also her mom and sister are severly obese and drinking exclusively coke) and I'm actually concerned about her. Don't know how to approach the subject cause she tends to be touchy about it. She has been opening to this since I've gained weight due to pregnancy and ppd. But unlike her I'm aware that it is completely in my control to go back on track. I just know that things will improve on e my boy sleeps a full night and I don't feel like starving at 3am after feeding him. It's a long road ahead but I will not let myself become her, I will stay completely aware"
So sad to see people who work hard to study and achieve a profession just to get so lost in crazy ideologies on the internet and ruin their entire lives and careers just to get likes from others demented people online 🤡
"Aaaaah, mini-Michelle doll, love herrrr ❤❤ 😂"
Extra
love how you shipped back into she pronouns a few times. 😆
💩
"I lost a large amount of weight a few years ago due to chronic illness and now I'm very underweight. Doctors CONSTANTLY lecture me about my weight, say how I need to eat more, gain weight etc.  The weight lecturing is not just done to obese people, it's done to EVERYONE. Get over it."
"Fun fact about diabetes: type 2 diabetes can degenerate in type 1 diabetes if you don’t follow a specific diet made for you and take medication. Also, these are a few of the side effects of having diabetes and not taking care of yourself and your health: blindness, heart disease, brain disease, need for amputation, etc. The moral of the story: if you have diabetes, TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF, regardless of type. Diabetes is diabetes. Also, I am speaking as a person who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at 6."
Michelle is entering her Barbie stop-motion era! 💃🏾<br><br>Here's the 💩 emoji to show I watched till the end.
"Indeed, just because you are fat doesn't mean you are lazy. It means you eat too much calories and unhealthy"
"I just want to say that i love love love the mini Michelle verse! Its so cute, the mini hot cheetos bag and book gave me life!"
I think it is hilarious that they received notice of an investigation into their ability to practice and their response is:<br><br>“lol no! I quit unless you meet my demands!”<br><br>Like that isn’t suspicious at all and it’s not like they’re the only doctor in the country.
💩
💩
Oh my goodness look at tammy slaton! She looks incredible!
Her ideas on health and overweight individuals is pretty 💩
"I have trouble believing this person is a doctor. She claims in the UK that doctors will just give you Ozempic. Firstly, in the UK, Ozempic is not prescribed for weight loss: it’s Wegovy (same thing but diabetics get one, and obese people the other and never the other way round unless they go to a private clinic). Secondly, GPs can’t prescribe Wegovy -you have to be referred to a weight loss service at a hospital. There’s long waiting lists and very stringent criteria and quite often rather than Wegovy you’ll get liraglutide which is a daily injection (if that). <br><br>This person appears at odds with reality."
"It's concerning to hear that a doctor believes obesity is solely a non-individual issue and dismisses the existence of visceral fat. Scientifically, visceral fat is well-documented and recognized as a significant health concern due to its association with increased risk of metabolic diseases. Dismissing its existence seems unprofessional and contradicts established medical knowledge.<br><br>Regarding the factors contributing to obesity, while genetic predispositions and environmental influences play roles, it's essential to recognize that lifestyle choices, including diet and physical activity, are major contributors. Research consistently shows that dietary changes alone can account for 70-80% of weight management efforts, with exercise contributing an additional 20-30%.<br><br>While factors like trauma and environmental conditions may influence weight, individuals can still exert significant control over their health outcomes through informed choices. Encouraging patients to make gradual, sustainable changes in their diet and activity levels can lead to meaningful improvements in weight management and overall health.<br><br>Addressing the concern the doctor raised about hunger and emotional eating (""listening to your body all the time""), it's crucial to differentiate between physiological hunger and emotional triggers for eating. Emotional eating can be a sign of underlying emotional issues or eating disorders that require professional intervention. Suggesting that eating is a solution to emotional distress oversimplifies complex psychological factors that should be addressed by qualified mental health professionals.<br><br>In conclusion, promoting a holistic approach to health involves understanding and addressing all contributing factors to obesity, including genetics, environment, and psychological well-being. Medical professionals must support patients in making informed decisions about their health without disregarding the significant impact of controllable factors like diet and lifestyle."
i really do love the Michelle -verse content!
That is a he? So they are fat positive and transgender? Just doubling up on labels I guess
"I was at doctor's office 2 days ago and she told me to step on the scale too, I'm not obese or even close to being chubby, so maybe they are making everyone to step on the scale? It's useful when they want to calculate the right amount of meds"
My girl who is 265 lbs absolutely hates the whole  fat acceptance and fat positive movement.
Love Dr. Idz.
"There are definitely instances where doctors tell patients to lose weight when weight is not contributing to the issue (like being 5lbs overweight and a doctor saying you have to lose a minimum of 20lbs, which happened to a friend of mine and was kinda weird cuz she was there for migraines?), but downright claiming AS A DOCTOR that obesity, visceral fat, and pre-diabetes isn't real and not your fault is definitely dumb as hell. We have evidence of human cadavers with visceral fat. We have proof pre-diabetes turn into T2 diabetes. We have proof obesity kills people. I hope this person doesn't get to practice ever again cuz they are DANGEROUS"
Well if you were healthy you wouldn’t be fat….
"Lol, as a VET, we weigh animals when they come in. 😂😂😂😂😂"
Bro needs to see an autopsy. That'd change his mind about the existence of visceral fat I'm pretty confident
"This is why it's not always a good idea to ""look at both sides"" some sides are bonkers"

This Dr is putting people in danger by spreading misinformation violating the oath so good riddance.
"If they accept their weight then why are they scared of the scale? Keep a check on ones weight at the doctor is Important. There are drugs that, if administer, they would need to dose according to weight."
"I mean, fat Dr should have had her licence revoked when she started thinking she was a hetheywhatever. Because it's medical biological truth, just like fat around the organs.<br>She can ignore one because she ignores the other 😜"
u r so fucking confusing me<br>do they use she or he pronouns? or both<br>cuz u always say smth else lmao
As much as I love seeing your face I was CAAAAACKLING the entire video and I loved the barbie.
There’s no cure for fatness lol there literally is
"If they really love being fat, they shouldn't have a problem getting on that machine and showing how fat they are. 🤷‍♀️"
Mediocre white women just gotta be mediocre white women
Thank you Michelle  for having the respect to not misgender this person and focusing on the facts that matter to this story. Another fun video!
"I have insulin resistance and it sucks but Im not gonna cry while eating icecream about it, why is it that bad to cut sugars a bit, its not even like completely its just having less of it"
"scales should be a gas stations. walmart,publix ,the restroom, McDonald's ect. everywhere"
"They weigh everyone, not just fat people. It's part of a medical record.  Also, you can refuse any treatment or test, including being weighed. But why do you go to the doctor if you don't want to get an assessment of health?  If you don't want to be assessed for health, don't go to the doctor. It doesn't make your problems go away."
"I mean, I fully agree with all your criticism of their statements and position but there's no need to misgender them."
"I once saw this American cartoon from the 1980s. Really dark humour. A bunch of emaciated concentration camp inmates are angrily scowling at the one fat concentration camp inmate, who declares ""It's not my fault, I have a glandular problem!""<br><br>Really dark and cynical, like I said. But it's a cartoon BECAUSE this is absurd. At no point in any human society have people with a calory deficit ever stayed fat because of their fat-person metabolism. Never. You ingest less calories than you burn, you lose weight. You eat more than you burn, you gain weight. It's not an attack on you personally, any more than the weather or gravity. It's simply a fact. So why is it so hard to accept responsibility for your weight? <br><br>And what's worst: telling people not to take responsibility for their weight is actively discouraging people who want a healthier life. It's just mean."
💩💩💩
Plastic Michelle is almost as pretty as the real Michelle.❤
"Medical diagnoses are offensive. Doctors should not tell anyone if they have cancer, heart disease, liver disease, pulmonary fibrosis or any disease that can result in death. That is offensive. Doctors should just tell people to continue their lifestyle and love the body they have. No treatment necessary. Offending them by telling them they have a serious medical disorder will cause psychological damage. Body positivity is the cure for all illness."
"All I see in their videos is a bitter, angry, awful human being who seems to love being miserable and wants everyone else to be just as bad off."
"I am a Dialysis Nurse. If you listen to this person (fat doctor UK), there’s a huge chance you’ll end up one of my patients!! Especially if the a normal doctor is telling you to lose weight and you have hypertension or Type 2 DM. Please don’t play with your health!!!"
"The fat doctor isn’t even a male.<br><br>I don’t have to respect the pronouns of anybody who doesn’t have my well-being at heart and as a doctor,<br><br>SHAME ON HER for spreading HARM!"
"I misspoke at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=835"">13:55</a> - God tempts no man. Thank you for those who pointed this out to me.
<br>
<br>“Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:” - James 1:13"
"Stop arguing, the truth is God will decide."
"The LGBT Pastor is forgetting the audience of the book of Romans, the Letter is directed towards the Romans.  The whole concept of Christianity is separating the people of the Book and the Christians from the common world and setting them apart for the worship of God."
those demons inside that man were manifesting
Saying Gay preacher is like saying Queers for Palestine. It doesn’t make a lot of sense.
Shame. We can only pray for this man. His love is not from God. Only Holy Spirit can convict him
Can we please stop calling the gay guy pastor. He ain't a pastor.
Imagine thinking you understand the cultural context of scripture better than Paul - a renowned Pharisee. This kid's narcissism is on another level.
"Correction God does not tempt us, the devil tempts us. Now God will test us. <br>James 1:13-15 NKJV
<br>[13] Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone. [14] But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. [15] Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.
<br>
<br><br>I Thessalonians 2:4 NKJV
<br>[4] But as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who tests our hearts."
We all need to pray the lies of the enemy come to light for this man! That the Father opens his eyes to the truth that this is indeed a sin! The enemy has him so blind! He needs prayer!
As always Christians twisting their scriptures to suit their misguided beliefs. Thank GOD FOR ISLAM WHICH MAKES EVERYTHING CLEAR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR TWISTING VERSES. GOD IS ONE WORSHIP HIM ALONE HE IS NOT A MAN NOR CAN HE DIE OR BE BORN ESPECIALLY TO A HUMAN AS A BABY.
I'm glad you took the time to talk to this young man who is not a pastor or Minister.   I don't know why he would call himself that he's reading the books and taking what he wants from it😮 God doesn't change his words cannot be misconstrued we all know what God meant and means and what he teaches we are to live like that and not make judgments against others we can't tell them that for sure they're going to hell but we pretty much know if you're not living by God's word you have to pay the price😊 just be willing to pay that price❤
"“Don’t you realize that those who do wrong will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don’t fool yourselves. Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality,”<br>‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭6‬:‭9‬ ‭NLT‬‬"
The caption in your thumbnail is offensive. Noboby in the video said anything like this
He is going to be very surprised shortly.
"God doesn't tempt, the enemy does!"
Repent or go to hell
"God is not the author of Confusion 1 Corinthians 14:33. I pray this man finds the true and living God and turn away from sin, because the wages of sin is death. Romans 6:33"
The patriarchal view is a modern interpretation that did not exist at the time of Paul.
😂😂😂😂
Hell🔥👹 awaits all gay people!! 💀
He’s literally tryna justify a sin .. how foolish
"I want to make a point. I think Brandan is wrong in what he believes and I agree with his opponents. However, I <b>do</b> think there are a couple of occasions where they're missing each other and he is possibly being picked up wrongly. What with slight breakups and delays in sound on the Zoom platform, I think clarity of the discussion is suffering.<br>He's also either being misunderstood or misrepresented @ 10.26."
"You cannot take the Bible out of content like that. You cannot take what fits youand twist it and leave what does not relate to you. Whether it is in Jesus time or our time, God's word remains the same yesterday, today and tommorrow!!!"
He doesn't want to understand the truth.
Blasphamous
"I feel sorry for Brandon, who is struggling with homosexual temptations and committing a sin condemned by God. It’s not easy, especially when you are young, to deny yourself and embrace a life of celibacy. As a Christian, it would be better for him to humble himself and acknowledge that he is a sinner, just as we all have sinned. His attempts to find excuses and twist the Bible, leading others astray, only deepen his fall."
"“Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. 14 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it."""
It's not just the sex relationship with their friend but they want to spread it to all society. Sodom and Gomorrah didn't just happen that one day. It was a social condition that got worse over time.
Wellcome to Sola Scriptura.
"What homosexuals can't understand is that the word of god condemns ALL perversions. Within those perversions, homosexuality is one of them."
He's a false preacher I hope God opens his eyes to the real truth and turns him away from his homesexual sin. <br><br>I was bisexual until I was 18 and then gave my life to gave and now I have a wife and daughter. God saved my life from destroying that sin from my life. <br><br>It's simple what does man don't lay with man mean it's not that hard to understand. It's common sense
this isn't a debate with a pastor. this is just a debate with some random gay guy
"What this guy said at @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=555"">9:15</a> pisses me off. What do you mean you are not sure how that works? It seems he is saying ""You are a sinner so you studying the scripture must be incorrect."" DUDE YOU'VE BEEN THERE! You started from a faith as small as a mustard seed! That comment was so unnecessary."
This man is not  a pastor. He wants to justify  his lifestyle. He can tell himself this lie and argue with these guys. He will not be allowed to argue with God and if he is convincing others that this his view will save them. He is guilty of leading them to hell.
"God said in revalation not to add or take away , not to change any of the Word of God!"
So if you live under the law of God then you by the word of God you die and not enter in heaven. One way to heaven through Christ and He is not Gay
As a pastor you a held more accountable for leading people astray.
God bottomline is a God of order
It’s not your point of view
So why was Sodom and Gomorrah destroyed?
For what he thinks is not right its written in Bible 3 times that gay is sin so why justify it if it was the plan of God to create homosexuality it would produce babies these are the persons who harden their heart so much that they dont hear or obey the Spirit of Truth. Therefore lust is not love lust is hate but worse. ✝️
I like how when he wasn't winning he tried to cut them off multiple times
"Lots of people have temptations.  It's our duty as Christians to resist and to do what we can to encourage others to resist.  Judge with righteous judgment, but judging alone isn't enough, you must help lead them from their strayed path."
How is the pastor? Gay isn’t homosexuality kind of forbidden in the Christianity world and I can tell the pastors a little bit ego
I have never seen someone try shard to justify their sin. Gay sex is wrong period.
Freakiest pastor ever 💀
"This gay ""pastor"" is leading his congregation to hell   If you go to his church run out of it and find a faithful church  a church pleasing to God"
Homophobics love their sin and will justify their sin. Real christians silence homophobics all the way
🏳️‍🌈🌈🏳️‍🌈🌈🏳️‍🌈🌈 its who i am 🌈🏳️‍🌈🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈 asexual
"I am Catholic, so I don't agree with Dr. White on everything, but I'm so glad he's combatting heresies like this. Glory to Jesus!"
"For his ""interpretation"" to be even close to correct requires accepting that marriage as directed by God in His word, equates to the wife being the chattel slave of the husband."
"😅 so if 2 men are married and have sex to make a baby, how does that work when it comes to actually producing LIFE.... NO life can come from 2 men! therefore death!"
"Well, then you simply don't believe the Bible. Just go, and do what you like. But you know you're wrong so you try to twist the Bible, to approve what you're doing."
"There are no gay christians. You might struggle with some past inclinations, but you can't continue to engage in those activities and be a christian."
"Evil will arways defend itself by claiming the higher moral ground.  Christ was cellibate, not gay."
"He's a Gay pastor 100%,.............. in the Church of Satan."
"""I reject what Paul has to say"".<br>Ooooooh....you getting a letter my guy."
"Needless to say, this gay pastor is being deceived by the spirit of Satan and using him to also deceive his congregation with his false teachings. As GOD destroyed Sodom & Gomorrah because of all the immorality and evilness from their homosexual lifestyles and community of perversion."
He rather serve his flesh and pride versus God
Delusional
"Look at him helicopter around in that seat, he clearly knows he’s wrong but if he admits that then his entire weak foundation from which he has built his wicked empire will be wiped clean and he can’t handle that truth"
"It is funny, the same people try to use the gay guys argument to support women teaching or being a pastor over men, and they fall flat on their face like this guy did.  The scripture says what it says, if you want deeper understanding, meaning you looking up the original words in Hebrew or Greek and you understand just how severe and blunt it can be.  When you defend sin or heresy you are on the wrong side of eternity.  Period."
the young man needs god
If same sex relationships were ”natural” and men only had “sex” with men..then the population wouldn’t exist in 100 years. How is this so hard for homosexuals to grasp? Same sex is NOT natural.
👍EXCELLENT!!!!!!!
"young man are you arrogant? Do you enjoy being what you feel is above every other human who is gay.? Why are you so focused on Gay relationships? ITs not just desires, it is who we are, Do you make money off God here on the internet? Maybe no sin is different than another as the bible says. God is forgiving and loving. He knows us you don't. He knows the reason we are struggling you don't. I wish you could love all people really. God will not send us to hell because everyone would be in HELL. There is not one perfect!"
"1 Timothy 1:10, Leviticus 20:13, Leviticus 18:22"
"acting on gay desires is a sin. but so is lying, or having hateful thoughts or a trillion other things. we all sin practiticlly all day every day. The problem is not doing the sin is denying that it is a sin. which means you aren't repenting."
"Poor soul, he is very lost. I hope God helps him."
You lost me at “gay” pastor.
"It’s an interesting debate, but protestant ism is basically Catholicism light. The true faith is in the eastern ancient church,  the orthodox church. The very centers of Christendom that Paul planted himself."
"Homosexual lifestyle: GRINDR, circuit parties, nightclubs, bathhouses, orgies, PREP, vanity.  <br>I lived that life for nearly two decades.  <br>Jesus said to deny ourselves, pick up our cross and to follow him.  <br>There’s no justification for homosexual physical relationships—period."
We do not know But he did hang out with 12 men
"Be VERY careful with James White. He's a false teacher as well bro, I'd love to show you if you're interested at all."
God and scripture is the standard for truth and morality. The subjective opinions of heretics leads to humiliation.
"2 Peter 3:16<br><br>[16] as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures."
"I see people quoting James 1:13 in response to your misquote. I think I know what you were trying to say,<br><br>""All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not leading to death."" - 1 John 5: 17
<br><br><br>Some sin seems to be an opportunity to refine your faith before non believers in order that god may be glorified in your suffering. <br><br>I pray this comment speaks the truth from god and any error is counted on my part."
Ok Mr Gay “Pastor” aka Satan
"SODOM, Lust Saturated going in the name of love THE LIE incidentally the Strong Delusion from God off the prophecy,  so all that believe the Lie should be condemned CAUSE THEY HAVE NOT THE LOVE OF THE TRUTH <br>The Strong Delusion from God revealed through the SODOMIC PRIDE LIGHTING of the White House by Caesar the RIDER OF THE WHITE HORSE OF THE APOCLAPSE <br>For the reason warned Jesus "" Remember Lots wife "" not just to Sodom but COMPLACENCY towards it, that caused Lots wife to turn into a pillar of salt,  the state that Protestant America is in today <br>Though Lots daughters had husbands in Sodom but could not reproduce while in it and their desperation became manifested when they reproduced though through incest, Reveals Sodom to be Anti Reproduction so Anti Family against the basic order & truth of Creation <br>Render unto God what is to God FAITH,  without which it is not possible to please God but surely not a Leavened/Corrupted Faith as in Protestantism's Faith Only <br>Render unto Caesar what is to Caesar  SCIENCE <br>So Faith & Science compliment each other <br>But when Caesar demands/pushes/Legalizes Sodom & its Unions that has no Scientific (Genetic) evidence other than Circumstancial (not admissible in a court of law) it amounts to a clear rebellion against God <br>The Result :: THE STRONG DELUSION FROM GOD <br>Bible : Fear not the ones who harm the body rather fear the one (God) who can both kill the body & destroy the soul in hell"""
America is worse than Sodom and Gomorrah
Gays were norn with a reprobate mind ...... If people really read the bible they wouldn't be gay
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=175"">2:55</a> gay goblin looking ahh why they all who say lgbt is not bad are like goblins"
"Wait, is he arguing an “exploitative relationship” with a woman is just fine?"
"Not sure why these guys would even humor this fool.....Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. There was a point in the beginning creating a woman and man. Pretty cut and dry, even IF you didn't believe in the Bible. He has a mental issue and needs therapy, not to mention the obvious.......Jesus."
No such thing as a gay pastor
I would not like to be in the place of this guy at the Last Judgement
"Genesis 3 with the serpent, “Did God actually say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree in the garden’?” <br><br>From the beginning the father of lies has been twisting scripture to fit lies. To say scripture is only significant with its time period means  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=790"">13:10</a> Brandon can’t be a pastor of a church, and a body of Christ(granted, he isn’t a pastor nor is his congregation a church). <br><br>When Jesus said love your neighbor in the synoptic gospels he only meant that in the first century not in the 21st century. Therefore the Bible is inadequate, the logical fallacy of irrelevance or irrelevant reasoning. <br><br>Though clearly in Hebrews 4 the author says “For the word of God is LIVING AND ACTIVE, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.” <br><br>The word convicts us of sin, we are exposed before God as fallen because of his word in verse 13. So, to make it less convicting and the weight of sin, less “weighty”, we discredit it and use fallacies to support our false pretenses. Or I’ve seen people say abortion is ok because God killed his own Son 😞. <br><br>“The heart is most deceitful above things and desperately wicked, who can understand it?”<br><br>“Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks.” <br><br>When your mouth speaks lies and twists scripture, you’re no better than the demons who have a greater level of faith than a false professing Christian( James 2:14-26)."
The gay pastor is just looking for an excuse to continue living in sin.
"When i see the gay pastor. I see satan laughing behind his back, so very sad"
This alphabet soup person is a heretic! I am sick that YouTube  allows this offensive offal on the channel.
"God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. End of story. Any more arguments on this topic is easy foolishness"
"We can acknowledge a gay “false” pastor … but there’s no such thing as a “gay” pastor.   Just saying, that’s anti biblical."
"Gay pastor, that's an oxymoronic statement. He is just twisting God's Word to suit his demonic lifestyle. He needs Christ and the true knowledge of Christ."
"With all respect,  the real problem here, and overall in the American church,  is that Jaiden, Brandan, Dr White, and Jeff have one thing in common....None of them ever succeeded in the world, as a believer, before becoming famous.  It is almost 100 per cent of all popular Christians.  No actual experience in the world as a believer, and now they are ""telling"" us the way things are.   Sounds good, Bible accurate,  very passionate history teachers all of them.   This is why Christianity is dying in America,  people have seen the foolishness of the system, the theoretical Christians.    How mature we say Jaiden is.  Mature at what??  Knowing Bible words,  Bible history,  and virtually ZERO experience at application.     Sorry everyone.  There are a few exceptions,  but remember....Did the speaker live as a believer in the world and SUCCEED, before becoming a leader??"
That “pastor” looks so sick. His soul is ded and he looks ded. It’s fascinating.
"Wow , corrupting the word of God to suit his life choices , not sure it works like that"
You can’t change God’s word to fit your own agenda. I pray he and others realize this before it’s too late. Pray for them.
God isn’t gonna anoint somebody that’s gay to preach satan disguise himself as an angel of light this so called pastor is lost and is heading straight to the lake of fire but he believes he’s heading towards heaven he needs to repent and stop twisting the scripture to make himself and all other gays comfortable we need to pray for him I ain’t writing this post to condemn that’s not mine or anybody’s job online God is the judge but the guy is wide open on the wide path
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=646"">10:46</a> this argument is an interesting one to take up. Homosexuals can’t procreate, therefore they don’t bring life. Neither does remaining single or being infertile, yet this is not condemned as sin or criticized by the church. I think they make a lot of points that are hard to argue with in the Bible, but I don’t love seeing this argument being made"
You guys interrupt too much. Not a good look homies
Homosexuality produces something Gods wrath
One man one woman
It’s disgusting 🤮 gay is wrong
Gay marriage is wrong
"Theologians, aren't they part of Catholics? So then their both wrong in their beliefs, and is infact hypocritical when he said to not bring outside sources of the bible, when Catholics openly admit that the seventh day is the sabbath but they changed it to sunday without any scripture, and only based on their own power, power they dont have."
Any sex outside of marriage is sin. Marriage is between a man and a woman under God. Case closed
yk what the problem here is? he's GAY
Itching ears
The homosexual man finds himself in a morality trap when he gets in a discussion about the word of God and knows it this come through when he won't answer the question straight up but is forced to  and then trys to give an in material explanation to a in morrow act it's this behavior that gives him away and shows he knows it is wrong but now he is trapped into satisfying his flesh the carnality of this world inorder words he is addicted just the kind of thing the devil wonts to see from person now he can drag him down to hell unless this yong man can find  salvation
"I'm kind of relieved that this is a Protestant issue, a ""priest"" arguing in favor of same-sex marriage in a Catholic Church would not be taken seriously and would be excommunicated. I'm Brazilian, and to us it's insane that you Americans have gotten used to seeing pride flags in churches and let them say all sorts of heresies at the altar."
People forget that you do have control over your desires and what you like or don't like
The gay pastor is living in sin and an imposter.
Wow that false prophet looks like an undead being.
"I feel sorry for the young guy because he is sincerely deceived. He found a couple of arguments to justify sexual perversion. Sex is a gift and has a purpose. Same sex perversion is clearly spelled out in the Scriptures. Pray that this young man gets set free and repents of his sins, and that he gets emotional healing."
All I’m hearing is “ I don’t identify as an idolater “ like sir just cuz u reject it doesn’t mean it’s false … when u are an idolater u cannot WORSHIP God which invalidates his credibility hence why it’s so easy to reject it . He knows what he is doing . Wolf and sheep clothing for sure .
Homosexual relationships do bring death. The bible doesn’t talk about your life it talks about all life and for life to continue that requires a man and a woman to create generational life. Two men or two women can not create generational life. Even if you consider adoption they aren’t bringing generational life they are advancing a bloodline that is not and can not be their own. Adopted children from all families whether they are same sex or not will wonder where they come from and will seek out these answers and if you can introduce the adult adopted child to his or her own parents later in life it will always give them a sense of joy. <br><br>They may have a negative interaction and never look to see thy heir biological parents again but knowing is closure .
When people start saying the “context” you know they are not servants of God.
Blaspheming my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ makes me sick. It's demonic anyone with the holy spirit knows the truth.
"Bull sh-t, what an ass"
"I hope you grow up "" dude"""
Why would people say this? You dude are a fool
Praise God
I love to quote Luke 14:33 to these traditional Christians and see them do exactly the same things they accuse LGBTQ affirming Christians do.
"the alteration of something from its original course, meaning, or state to a distortion or corruption of what was first intended.<br>""a scandalous perversion of the law""<br><br>Anything that does this goes against Gods law. That includes homosexual sex. Gods intention for man in his original state was that Adam and Eve have relations and children. This was perfect love. If you want to know the truth just see what the Jews currently believe about homosexual sex. They are against it and put it in the category of Adultery. Anything outside of a Jewish marriage is adultery. This is very clear. It is a sin. It misses the mark."
what app they use to read the original hebrew words
"Your doing a good work, keep up the faith. And love for Gods children"
The fact a gay man was allowed to be a pastor is blasphemous in itself. God condemned this behavior and said it's punishable by death! False prophet
"It IS within your control. I am expected 1000% to deal with my overwhelming cravings for drugs (when I was first saved).  We are expected to deal with urges to cheat on spouses right? What man doesn’t lust after a woman other than his wife occasionally? But are you going to say he can’t help it, poor guy it’s just who he is! Nope. We do not make excuses for any other sin the way we do homosexuality.  As Voddie Baucham said, he doesn’t believe people ARE homosexuals.  It’s not an immutable characteristic like being white or black. There is the act the Bible calls sodomy.  People choose to commit that act.  Now the perverse desires is something we have to hand to God.  IF you are born again, you are a new person.  New heart and mind. A regenerate person.  Brandon has obviously been deceived into believing he has been saved but how can one be saved when they have never acknowledged their own sin, and obviously not repented of it! On the contrary! He says scripture isn’t infallible, and God loves homosexual relationships and teaches countless others this heresy without conviction! He may be reprobate at this point.  You can not give passes on certain sins and condemn for others! Will the church now accept child predators? They will say they can’t help how they feel as well! So do men who beat their wives who just feel angry all the time! Who commits sin without FIRST “feeling” that need to? The heart is deceitful above ALL things and desperately wicked! Who can know it?  Our hearts lie to us! We have to trust and rely on scripture! NOT what we feel! That’s why we are told we must die to self daily and pick up our cross and follow Jesus ! These people aren’t willing to sacrifice anything for Jesus! It’s their way or no way.   We should pray he has the truth revealed to him."
"He said if ya read it like you do sure! It sounds like a broad condemnation of ALL gay sex. Insinuating that some gay sex is not a sin, correct? Well since marriage was defined BY God as between one man, one woman, that means two men or two women could NEVER be married. Right? And that means ANY sex between two men would ALWAYS be sexual immorality! It will always be a sin because same sex marriage is not a thing! It doesn’t exist to God! We could allow a man to marry a tree or squirrel (by our standard of marriage, give them a certificate of marriage etc) but that doesn’t mean they ARE married in the sight of God! There is not one example where two men (or women) can have sexual relations and it NOT be sinful! In short, since marriage isn’t an option, sex isn’t either!"
"I watched the entire video and at no time did I where Brandon was ""humbled"" by anyone. He's a very smart and eloquent man who handled himself very well in this discussion."
"I will speak on myself as a woman who has lust toward women and desires for women, I think it’s easier on me bc I’m not fully attracted to women I am incredibly attracted to men, but I know what the desires and temptation is like. I will say this; the more you give yourself over to it, the easier it becomes to delude yourself into thinking it’s okay and God will forgive. “Well even if I act on it God will forgive”; repentance literally translates to “TURN AWAY FROM”. If you are actively giving yourself over to these temptations, you will fall victim to the mindset that God can move past it. Our God is CREATOR, his law is JUST. Just because we think he’ll forgive, do not convince yourself that his law falls apart bc of it. He only forgives in times of active repentance.<br><br><br>I will also add on, I am now about to turn 23 this month, I got a porn addiction starting from fourth grade. Within all those years I am proud to say that God held me fast and I have never once been physically intimate with a woman. I praise Jesus for it but I will also say to anyone who has, I do not judge you I do not condemn you. I just pray for you and I pray Jesus can give you peace and forgiveness for yourselves."
"Yea, Jesus literally  said, no sex before marriage and marriage is between a man and a woman but Jesus is gay. That is ridiculous."
I think he needs to get more simple. God said be fruitful and multiply and you cannot do that in a same sex union.
This pastor is off his flipping rocker!!!! It’s so twisted!!!
The Old Testament also stained people but we don’t do that anymore
"Doesn't the bible clearly say being homosexual is a abomination of God,why debate with them."
"It's not controversial being gay it's a sin,stop the nonsense."
Bro tell me that gay pastor don’t look like paranorman as an adult
“Paul has a patriarchal world view” … this gaay man is delusional
This is not the right way to carry a debate. You have to let the other person talk too even if you don’t agree with their position.
I'm sorry LGBTQ is not a very controversial... They're just gay. Who cares. They're just trying to make something out of nothing
Why are we watching a 14 year old kid listening to a debate?
"Hi! Gay Christians DO exist :3 they're still saved. Why? Their saving faith in Jesus. Their desire to serve the Lord produces visible fruit in their lives, a Testament to their salvation.<br>They're not going to hell just because they're gay. That idea is simple human judgment."
"Paul strikes me as a total solophobic homo, and voyeur. Physiology is not like temptation, you must be joking. Try putting down the Book, and speaking to Him directly. He is Alive, seeing and listening right now. He will show you, if you only ask, and have patience. He plays a long game, and doesn't do magic tricks. He performs miracles, great and small, for those who allow Him. His great Love knoweth no boundary!"
"Literally the definition of changing God’s word to fit your own agenda.  I mean, at least have some strong facts and reasoning behind such a deviation."
"If God wanted for men sleeping with men and woman sleeping with woman he wouldn't have created ADAM And Eve so shut up with your stupid answers , I wonder if the old your co is a  speaker is the man or the woman in there relationship."
It's plainly unnatural. Even animals knows its wrong<br>Tribes in 3rd world countries agree this is unnatural. <br>An abomination
He is doomed.
I’ve never in my life heard of a “gay pastor” what blasphemy is that?
The only loving committed relationship God approved of is marriage. Which is between a man and a woman. He does not support boyfriends and girlfriends. This is a very simple concept. There’s no argument to be had.
Gay dude completely fails at logic
"I've been struggling with same sex attraction my whole life.  We can argue all we want. But all we need is the Holly spirit dicerment to know the gay pastors is wrong.  Trying to justify your sin with words is just not going to work. I've tried for years, but the truth will set you free"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=648"">10:48</a> after asking the question 4 times and watching this boy squirm and wriggle to avoid it was quite funny. You can see his intellectual dishonesty on display."
What do you mean he has desires he can't control? This is wrong.
"Brandon might have studied the word of God but he is far from living the word of God. “Talk is cheap, like daydreams and other useless activities. Fear God instead.” -Ecclesiastes 5:7"
"you are a true thinker from the Word, you have compassion for the sinner. may we all have the same desire to pray for the lost."
"REJECTION of GOD's Words is a dangerous thing! That may be the reason why they keep trying to twist the Scripture the best they can and becomes worse in their part. ""Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things."" (Romans 1:22-25)."
"Young LBGT pastor  you still have a lot to learn.  You are twisting the Word of God.  Yes, look what happened to Sodom & Gomorrah .....    you are teaching the Word of the Father of Lies (Satan).   Praying for God to open the eyes of your understanding.  You are trying to justify your sinful lifestyle.  You are totally false. The question is:  where do you want to spend eternity.  It s where you want it to be."
"how old is this red head in the smaller window.   mudder flucker, he can't be over 16.   And he's going to tell us what the fluck is going on.   omfa"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=841"">14:01</a> God doesn't give us temptations, it's our sinful nature and free will. James 1: 12-15 ""12 God blesses those who patiently endure testing and temptation. Afterward they will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him. 13 And remember, when you are being tempted, do not say, “God is tempting me.” God is never tempted to do wrong,[a] and he never tempts anyone else. 14 Temptation comes from our own desires, which entice us and drag us away. 15 These desires give birth to sinful actions. And when sin is allowed to grow, it gives birth to death."" It's not in God's character to tempt us, he's not setting up schemes to see if we will give into our sinful nature. He knows we will because of free will, that's why Christ dying on the cross in forgiveness of our sins is so important."
"Sooo… when God created woman, was God thinking their sons should be having sex with sons? Why didn’t he create another man instead of woman if that’s the case"
Is that Jamal Muhammad White?
"He does not worship God. He worships his own god, his own created god based on his twisted understanding of the scriptures. To get anything they want they will twist the true Word of God for a lie. This is classic sin justification. Blind man. I pray that God strikes his heart with the fear of God. I pray he wakes up and opens his eyes to see the Light of Christ. Amen 🙏🏻✝️"
I bet he thinks sex with animals is okay too.
"The Bible speaks about this, and warns that man will attempt to twist the meaning and interpretation of Gods word in order to fit their own agenda. So not only does this sadden me how lost that man is, it excites me how close to the coming of Jesus Christ we are."
"These people can't seem to understand that our Lord only wants whats best for us. Its exactly like when your parents give you rules. No one is trying to take your ""fun"" away, just make sure you're safe."
"The Bible is literal. It is not complicated.  He loves his sin more than God, just my opinion."
"This was excellent but God does not give us temptations.  Satan gives us temptations. Christ allows it because of free will and also hopefully conversion.  Jas <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=73"">1:13</a>  No one, when tempted, should say, 'I am being tempted by God'; for God cannot be tempted by evil and he himself tempts no one."
"The fact that these LGBTQ@TB+2XYZ ""pastors"" disregard Paul's teaching while still holding to anything the Bible says is ridiculous. Either you believe the Word is God-breathed or you don't. If you don't, then you don't know God. <br>This is the same argument I have with non-Creationists who say they're Christians. I'll defer to your ignorance, but after being exposed to the truth if you keep hold of the lie, then you undermine the entirety of the Bible."
His demon is showing. I pray that his eyes are opened before its too late and repents.
"Even if you weren't sure whether or not something was a sin, why would you risk going to Hell for eternity off of that? We all have to deny aspects of ourselves. Gay people aren't special."
Listening to this debate is absolute proof to show why Christianity is doomed
That's why Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed!
"Hanging a Pride flag in a church is comparable to when the Phillistines brought a statue of Dagon, the fish god into the temple. We all know how God responded to that. 🙄"
"If Paul’s teaching was affected by his embracing of the patriarch, is there any scripture where that doesn’t occur?  How do you know anything about the faith, if it is corrupted to the point of rejecting the person who wrote most of the NT."
Everyone is sinful including pastors... The difference between regular pastors and this guy is that they don't base their identity around their sin....<br><br>You are the devil sir
bro called james white a “well seasoned theologian” 😂😂
God himself calls it an abomination..
😊 dude you done for.
"Alright I came across this and am actually saddened but it’s also a strong prayer point for all of us as Christian. The devil is seeing revival in church and making sure to penetrate it as well. Well before we go very far Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because of same sex marriage, now am hearing this like gay Pastor.. like how can you put the two together? He studied the word of God but didn’t allow the word of God to change him. There’s no such thing as gay Christian. But God can change anyone. I pray that that guy encounters God. Same sex marriage is spoken against throughout the Bible! Guys it’s a prayer point for us, let’s pray for that LGBT community that they encounter God."
"If the gay pastor is a practising sodomist, he has  no business being a pastor."
"It’s seems harsh but God will be harser. Some religion’s cut peoples head off😢but the Christian,s go in and tell them the truth and we all know truths hurt ❤ and we all try and justify and make it fit but some things doesn’t matter how hard u try it just doesn’t fit x"
Seems to me the sin of Homosexuality is Pride…sound familiar
"AS a human..... Christians are more focused on SEX being a sin than anything else in the BiBLE or church. They use the scripture to make themselves feel better. You mentioned ... MONEY , Fame and PRIDE as sin but yet you are here on this format trying to become popular and make money. All sin is equal and there is not one worth of the kingdom of heaven but you all think just because you are not HOMOSEXUAL you are automatically going to heaven. NOPE GREED and corruption will send you down the same road as homosexuality. If you believe in the torment of hell and that God would actually send those he loves to Hell. Would you send your child to hell no matter what they did. ? Of course not so then how much more can God love us being GOD! Common sense is what God expects us to use."
Lord give me understanding in Jesus name Amen
"It is simple, a straight man not staying true to his nature is a sin, a gay man going against his true nature is a sin."
"Correction "" God does not give us temptations""."
"I'm not sure Brandon was ""humbled""..."
"This Robertson guy is brilliant, thanks for introducing him!"
Simple example <br><br>God burned the Sodom and Gommorah for their sexual immorality <br><br><br>Man having sex with another man
So gay its disgusting
That’s not a gay preacher! He is a false prophet there are no “REAL” preachers that are gay
These is definitely demonic
Why is a woman so horrible to a gay man? I don’t understand are they repulsed or what? All women are repulsive? I want to understand
This gay pastor will pay an even higher price for his lies and deception
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=542"">9:02</a> Can feel trough screen that he is doing this for himself. No relationship with God or wish to know him."
One is not Christian another one barely is
Crap!
"The gay pastor is not a pastor. He irks me to no end. He is leading people straight to hell, and he will be there!"
Gays think everyone is gay. Wishful thinking.
Christianity is stupid
Edomites are satan's children god hares you romans 9.13 christ died for the children of isreal. John 3.16 cant save you read Isaiah 45.17 thats the world god loves
Edomites are satan's children god hares you romans 9.13 christ died for the children of isreal. John 3.16 cant save you read Isaiah 45.17 thats the world god loves
Why does his head move like that?
that is blasphemy may God forgive that gay pastor
Gay pastor sounds absurd
Both pastor are demonizing each other to prove themselves are right <br>This guys are shaming religion for some YouTube views
"1 Corinthians 6:9-10<br><br>9 Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor HOMOSEXUALS, nor sodomites,<br><br>10 nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God."
Why don’t you try creating your own content instead of playing somebody else’s videos little boy
A gay Christian Minister 🫨<br>that's like trying to stir oil with water it just doesn't mix.
How do you use gay and Pastor in the same sentence there is no such thing
The work of devil those who not love the truth are not from the lord
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=454"">7:34</a> Except more than once Paul elevates women to a position of authority. Like when he had Apollos taught."
"Why are yah listening to this crap, why have a debate with this fool, he wants the bible to accept his sin, your gay and its a sin, ignore him and why make a video with this nonsense"
So we just gonna sit here and act like you’re not carbon copying daily dose of wisdom?
Imagine being in an LGBT church then dying and going to hell thinking that you were living for God sad 😢
“You have no justifications for your ethical claims because you abandoned God”
Satan is promoting homosexuality to decrease the repopulation of humanity. And he will use people who deeply believe that their agenda is the truth. He is the master of deception
✝️
"""Paul is not credible as an apostle""...that eliminates half of the new testament🤦"
It is not just evangelical that believe this you clown even religion believe that
People worship as god which off course it said that Jesus is god. And they also worship Satan and call him god too the bible Cleary states that Jesus and Satan are angels are not to be worshiped basically he worshiping Satan
Why are you given this clown and platform 😅😅😅
Arguing with Sodomites is futile unless God intervenes
What a fool. Defending homosexuality is insanity
Imma sum up how Christ feels about same sex abominations:<br>🤢🤮😱
"Good debate.   I would make one correction though…….God does not give us each different temptations.   Read James 1:13.   The things that we are tempted with is simply the result of original sin.   I have no doubt that there are people who are literally born was unnatural desires towards the same sex.  When people say they are born that way I do not disagree that men and women can be born with a desire to be with the same sex.  However, to give into these desires is still a choice.   The fact of the matter is we are all born sinners.  This is why Jesus says we have to be born again.  Once we are born again he will transform our hearts and minds back to the natural order that he originally intended"
"Gay pastor, haha, is it bad to want to slap a pastor? The church has been infiltrated."
"The Hebrew text is specific to the act itself. It applies to any context you throw against it - ancient or present, exploitative or otherwise. The law condemns the act itself."
Look at what happened to Sodom and Gormarrah.<br>The LGBT have their own bible as well.
“Same-sex relationship do not bring death”<br>….<br>“They don’t bring life” 😮🫨
Galatians 6:7
"Jesus himself was bisexual and some of his best friends were gay, so what is all the fuss about?"
God help us with sexual immorality! Btw I can’t stand someone rejecting the truth like this gay pastor!
"He’s going to face one of the worst punishments in the pit of fire if he doesn’t repent, which I pray he turns around nothing is impossible with God, but dang…… he is so delulu"
So when do you fulfill: Be fruitful and multiply? Is it a command or a suggestion?
If a Pastor is sincerely preaching or teaching this then id 100% be questioning their Salvation 🤔
"And why does Gods Word say be fruitful & multiply, that can only happen with a Man & a Woman.<br>No other union or relationship can bring life or multiply which from the very beginning is how God designed the natural World & i for one am glad❤"
"No Scripture or prophecy is of any private or secret interpretation.<br>God is not a respecter of person's, He will never reveal something to one person without revealing it to other's for confirmations sake & so there's no confusion. <br>God has not given us a Spirit of fear but of power & a sound mind❤<br>The Scripture means exactly what it say's."
"“To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.”<br>‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭8‬:‭20‬ ‭KJV‬‬"
The bible never stated that.
God does not tempt! <br>The false narrative of the guy claiming to be a pastor is evil and unbiblical. He’s leading people to hell because he acts upon the homosexual desire  and justifies the abomination of an act he commits and then teaches people to believe in the nonsense. <br>All that he said made 0 sense.
This is insane twisting of scripture from this self proclaimed “gay pastor.” Wow pray that Brandon comes to the truth and the Lord frees him from this deception.<br><br>I’ve also heard Brandon speak and say that Jesus sinned as well when he was speaking on “The Line of Fire” with Dr. Michael Brown.
"I get the gay pastors point on the context since tattoos are also a debated topic on whether it is sin or not because of the cultural context of the time it was considered a sin. But the thing is, later on, Jesus states that marriage is between a man and a woman. So if sex is supposed to be reserved for marriage, then how could homosexual practices not be sinful if by the word of God they can not marry."
Howdy doody look more like a man in this non-Preacher Satan Jesus any kind of fool to do his bidding
“Be fruitful “
Brandon has numerous demons in him or at the minimum oppressed. The word of GOD is infallible.
Thanks for the video. Keep up the good work 👍
Isn't it funny how there's literally no proof of people being born gay yet they claim they are.<br>Like how? By growing up in a single mother's home? By being sexually abused? By wanting to beat woman in sports?
"The lord is my shepherd, I’ll shall not want"
This is no pastor of the gospel. You can see in his face that he is not well spiritually speaking. He is desperately looking for excuses to justify his perverted way of living and can't stand being told truth.
Paul got his views from the Holy Spirit - the Spirit of Truth‼️
My question is:  What will this “Pastor” say when Jesus returns and states that being gay is not acceptable and is in fact a sin ????
You can’t worship god if you’re making a god that allows sin  that’s a different god that I worship the true god in bible does not exempt a sinful nature
"One chapter earlier in Leviticus 18, God (Jesus, because He was the God of the Old Testament) said it plainly, ""Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind: it is abomination.""<br><br>This so-called pastor comes at the Bible from a purely secular angle with his insistence on looking at the ""context of the world.""<br><br>On the subject of the errancy of the Bible, the gay ""pastor"" is technically correct, as the Bible does contain errors, <i>but</i> the primary cause of those translational errors came from the Catholics editing the original scripts in the medieval period when they sought to rule the spiritual world of Europe with an iron fist. As offensive as that may sound, it's historical. That aside, the Bible itself is the word of God, as far as it is translated correctly."
"What’s worse is my daughters high school had a Pastor who identifies as an ally to the LGBQ and encouraged the students it was ok to be gay. At the same time teachers were making my daughter remove her necklace that had her gold cross on it. They talk about creating safe spaces for these troubled youth while forcing my 14 yo daughter to remove her religious jewellery. After a heated phone call to the school turns out she IS allowed to wear her religious symbols but it must remain out of view under her clothes, even when the school wear and promote rainbows.<br>Sad when people that can’t procreate WANT TO RAISE MY CHILDREN 🤬🤬"
The amish dont even have these problems. lol
"I still don’t see why I should have no respect for someone who is gay, nor should I cast them out for a “sin” they committed, when heart-fully, it’s just love."
"This pastor definitely hasn’t read nor studied the BIBLE! The BIBLE is defensive in both the old and New Testaments. GOD is the same yesterday, today and tomorrow. The BIBLE  is the inerrant word of GOD! This it is definitely a false preacher!!"
It occurred to me a while back that the prophesied forces of darkness when we enter Armageddon are the woke…
just perverts making it up to suit there own needs
If God was against homosexuality as suggested by some Christians you wouldn’t need to nitpick verses from the Bible to prove it. It would be one of the 10 commandments. God does not care who you sleeping with but the context of why you are sleeping with them.
",,I reject that."" 😬 No offense to you bro but you reject the ""worldview"" of Paul...Who was one of the few chosen patriarchs by Jesus."
The Bible says in the end times people will look for someone to tickle the ear and tell them it's ok to sin so that's what he's doing is tickling the ears of man
"The ""community"" conflates homosexuality with regards to the church. It is and always will be a sin because the intended meaning of sex is to procreate. It's not pleasure. It doesn't mean gay are bad people. We all sin. Fact remains, if the world turned completely gay tomorrow, the human race wouldn't last very long. This simple rule applies to every single person, the act of sex is for the singular purpose of creating life. If your intention is to have sex where creation is a physical impossibility, it's sin. This ain't rocket science, folks . If I cheat on my wife, it's a sin. If I cheat on my wife because I love someone else, it's still a sin."
The greek pronunciation here is giving me autism
Can we get this redhead guy out of the corner of the screen? Lol
"Praise the Lord!!!  He has shown us all His Mercy. So much. We could all be in that place where there is no more hope. The people there know why they are there and that there is no hope.I can't tell you how many times I tried suicide. Suicide is the most narcissistic thing a person can do. They don't think how they are hurting others,  And they don't think of the many people in Hell that wish they had another day to make that decision. People in hell are believers. What I think will shock people who go there is no human or demon or Satan himself rules hell."
Sick
"It is written, ""My brethren, let not many of you become teachers, knowing that we shall receive a stricter judgment"" James 3:1"
How can Paul not be credible? Didnt Jesus also appear to Paul after the resurrection.
Amen 🙏 it’s nothing more than a perverted spirit you’ll have to pray against the flesh.
This is ridiculous
"There is no such thing as a homosexual, just people committing the SIN of homosexuality.  Bottomline."
"Just because it was common, doesn't make it right. It's still SIN."
"It is impossible to be saved and gay at the same time. Simply because, if you truly had gotten saved, you will repent and turn from SIN. Including the SIN of homosexuality!  So when someone says they are gay AND saved, it's an abomination to God Almighty."
"This pastor is lost, completely lost the true interpretation of the word of God"
"Jaiden, for a new Christian, you are very wise! Stay in the Word, young man, God is blessing you with wisdom!"
A way to know if something is right or wrong is if everyone did said behavior what would happen to our species and our world. If everyone shot heroin what would happen to our world opposed if heroin didn’t exist?<br>If the world only had 1 man 1 woman for life marriage compare to if everyone was in homosexual relationships….how would that world look after a generation? Pretty simple really
"I think they use God to try and hide their shame, they know deep down its very wrong! I hope he can repent so he he can see the true wirds of God!!"
God isn’t gay
"I don’t necessarily agree with either, but it’s just unproductive to shun a group of people who also believe in Jesus. Am I wrong? It seems like the dogmatic guy is pushing the other guy away. I don’t recall the 10 commandments saying anything about being gay or anything. Unite. Don’t divide."
wow!!!
"@JaidenForrrest , so obv arguing/debating with this guy wont make him change but what do you think the goal of this debate was. to prove him wrong? if Brandon doesnt come to see the err of his theology, what should be our response as Christians? do we condemn him? should we be the first to cast a stone?"
"Gay pastor, is a joke. They do not understand the  word of God. Can not be gay, and be a Christian."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=849"">14:09</a> maybe you just worded it wrong but God NEVER and I mean never tempts anyone <br>James 1:13 <br>“When tempted no one should say “God is tempting me” for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone;”"
You have prevented the Bible is a sin but as a leader of the flock a clergy man being gay opening and putting it forth promoting is a day of you don't leave your position and repent there will be a day with the Lord all sins are sins but how come this is a new thing no early church father's did this the day with the Lord will be a on your head if you don't leave this now gay pastor I'm a sinner maybe i don't suffer with that sin but pastor you need to leave and tremble at you have done
"I don't really understand problem, this ""pastor"" claims he believe in God from Bible and it clearly explain in 1 Cor 6:9-10 , that gay will not inherit God's Kingdom, and more God destroy Sodoma and Gomorah for this sin."
"Something that all three of them are missing, and admittedly I haven't finished the whole thing because I'm at work and I'm watching it in small segments, but I just passed the point to where he was saying that the reason Paul believed that homosexuality was sinful was because of his patriarchal worldview. But the significant issue with this is that Paul's not the one writing in the New Testament. He's putting pen to paper, but they're the words of god. And let's forget about the whole homosexuality debate, if we can't even agree on that, then we need to be having an all-around different conversation."
"""I reject that"" as if you and God are equals, free to disobey His commands at will without facing any consequences. Would you mind rejecting the sun rising each morning? Tell it not to shine on the earth until you've had enough sleep. If not, it is impossible to reject a single Word from the Bible and still hope to have a positive relationship with God. <br><br>""So shall My word be that goeth forth out of My mouth: It shall not return unto Me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it."" Isaiah 51:11. The same God who said ""let there be light"" and there was light, said ""the soul that sinneth shall die."""
"Jaiden, you poor lost recloseted boy.. No amount of church or scripture will ever help you.. Shame.."
"God does not give us temptations. Satan places temptation in our thoughts, in our vision, in our emotions. It is then OUR DECISION to act upon or reject them. This is the confusion Satan has created to cause so much division. GOD did not create us with these temptations. Our enemy, satan,  places it in our thoughts.  That is why we must understand how to use the Armor of GOD.  JESUS did not leave us weaponless against the enemy.  We make ourselves vulnerable the moment we tolerate  other people's sin because we struggle with the same sin."
Sodom&gomora. Does everyone remember that tale? Sulfur&brimstone raining from heaven to destroy the twin cities of debauchery and corruption. As they were fleeing; if they looked back turned to salt. Ye the young goof is a heretic....
"If you really know God and love Jesus, the Holy Spirit would guide you as the what is right and wrong in your life. You would just know, you would just feel it in your heart. Maybe He has shown you before but you were not willing to accept it and instead choose to please your fleshly desires instead.

defining scripture seems like a very important thing to do here. and i believe that one must be very careful in doing so.
"Great video sir! Keep up the good work, continue to speak the truth. You added lots of great points at the end. Have an awesome day!"
"Brandon has to presuppose his own worldview in order to make his interpretation of Scripture consistent, this is the error of Eisegesis that all who willfully sin use to justify their habitual sin."
"As soon as anyone brings up patriarchy, they already lost"
parody of a pastor. why even talk to the guy? dont think Paul would have entered a debate with him. just think about it!
Wow!  This false pastor clearly twists the Word to fit his presuppositions
Of all the sins in the Bible were told to pray against and rebuked lust is the only one that we are told to flee from
"this is not even suppose to be debatable, it's just pure justification for their movement, to hopefully be accepted, fortunately, they won't ever get the acknowledgement they ever seek."
There's no gay pastor 😢
"There is something wrong if this doesn't profoundly grieve your soul - but instead produces hatred in your heart.. you need to rekindle your compassion for the lost... Lord Jesus, if it be Your will: free this man from the grasp of Satan and draw him into your Blessed arms..."
"The very fact that he HAS TO ""justify"" his beliefs.... is all the evidence he should need as proof that what he is doing is SIN.  If he were to stand in front of Jesus and ask Him what He thinks... does he honestly think that Jesus would justify this.  If that were true, he wouldn't have to justify it... God's word would clearly explain it for him.   He KNOWS he's incorrect.  He just doesn't want to see it."
"See...here's the thing, Mr. Gay Pastor.... ""I don't believe that"" is not a relevant argument.  What YOU believe is irrelevant .... the only thing that matters is, THE TRUTH set forth by GOD.  YOUR ""beliefs"" do not trump what GOD'S WORD says.  It's plain as day.... the Bible says that a Man laying with a Man is a SIN.  Period.  You need Jesus my friend.  You need to pray.  Jesus commands us to go forth, be fruitful and multiply.  You can not OBEY God if you can not multiply.   You are spreading Sin.  You are saying that YOUR BELIEFS are more important to you than God's words."
"""God"" must have been gay since he decorated the world so well."
"One hiccup in the video, God doesn’t give you temptations, the devil does. God helps combat temptations. But other than that perfect video bro. i love that you’re spreading the word!"
Its crazy the amount of hoops this guy is trying to jump thru to pervert and distort gods word
Homosexuality destroys life. Men can't get pregnant and you raising kids will not bring life.
"He keeps saying ""it seems, it appears, but the context...."""
And what did he do to the dity of Sodom and Gomorrah? He destroyed it because when you do that God says you pollute the land.
that's right Men lusting after Men is wrong!
Men/Emperors made it a common practice to sleep with 10-11 year olds does not make it right.  They were ordered to do so.
There is evidence of Egyptian men with men DRAWN in the caves of Egypt and I'm sure in CAnaan just as it was prevalent in ROME.
"The problem is that LGBTQ people want to translate/misinterpret Gods word for their own lifestyle. God is not the author of confusing. He is very specific. Do not lie man with man, woman with woman or either with a beast. God is not a man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should repent."
That gay so-called pastor is leading people straight to hell. I hope he knows that God will judge him severely.
"For corrections bro,<br>God doesn't give us temptations, it all comes from our own desires <br>James 1:13-15"
"I'm only 17 but my family are pastors and I will be frank it's not a debate it's a fantasy to believe that you will find fulfillment by a man dating another man it's just disgusting the idea of doing that if god made man and if God created woman so that man would not feel alone then tell me why is it that mam would want man, man would feel alone but if man would want woman than man would not feel alone am i right?"
What i find interesting is gay people turn to the bible for confirmation yet disregard the truth. If the bible does not matter why do they even read it?
Look I get the kid gay pastor is clearly very confused and not fit to be a pastor at all. But the real pastors shouldn't have just interrupted the kid so much. It made them look real bad.<br>And this is coming from an orthodox christian before people pile up on me calling me a heretic.
You waste time  gay go push puty
Sharia Law solves most problems.
God doesn’t give us temptations
James White finally wins a debate but did it with zero grace.
Wolf in sheep's clothing. Be careful out there
Poor interview/debate
"9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,<br><br>10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.<br><br>11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:<br><br>12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.<br>  <br>Unfortunately you are dealing with someone with who has been given to a strong delusion, He has passed the line of repentance"
God doesn't make people gay it's a choice
As a Born Again Christian I don't believe that Gay people are going to automatically be in hell but I do believe that God has grace and is just. God bless to you all ❤
"The part of this debate I don't think was done properly is how the two continue to interrupt Robertson. If someone is giving their explanation, you let them continue to speak without interruption. That is how you not only save time by forcing the other person repeat themselves, but you miss parts of what they say as you interrupt them.<br>In a debate, when you interrupt the other also shows you are not listening to the other debater, you are locking and loading words to hit them with. Therefore, as you interrupt someone you are not hearing what they are saying, you are mentally readying your word. When you do this, you miss words from your opponent you could later use as a foundation to reply to.<br>I agree that Robertson is a false teacher.<br>I have desires for wealth that is stronger than sexual urges. That does not mean I can become a preacher and twist the words in the Bible that deals with monetary riches and wealth. One who has what feels like a natural urge, but that urge is against God's word, then one must fight day and night to resist that urge. It is not to say, ""This is what I find to be natural within my being, so it must come from God, or be a natural part of humanity"", no, if you have a prohibited urge and desire, you must fight it, not give into that temptation.<br>The more you fight and resist that temptation, the easier it is to continue fighting and resisting until the temptation no longer holds power over you."
"Dust off your feet, guys. They know, and they don't care."
Man Jaiden keep going young sir. You remind me of me when I was young.
How far men have fallen from grace the rebirth of Sodom and Gomorrah has started... In the bible LGBTQ people have no place they wont see heaven for heaven is a place where the saved and the righteous will go those who have accepted christ as lord and savior.. as a Christian i feel heartache for the LGBTQ community coz they are lost sheep and the devil is using them to gain more sheep to the damed ..but God is great i believe that one day they will be saved i hope they will be saved coz in the end they will burn in the eternal flame
They where doing that in Solomon and gour that's why God destroyed that city
"Leviticus 18:19 is in the same chapter as <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=1102"">18:22</a>, but Christians ignore the former while condemning the latter. Yet, God calls both abominable.<br>I've also heard Christians speak against drag, but excuse watching Mrs. Doubtfire as entertainment, when Deuteronomy 22:5 doesn't give that kind of caveat. So when it comes to immorality, Christians are making excuses to justify what they do, and we need to repent and agree with God."
"The Bible clearly says 1 man, 1 woman. Cling to your wife. God made them to procreate. 2 men can not create a child. God made our parts to fit together as a puzzle in order to have children. All creation proves that. Gay sex is an abomination. God did NOT create us gay."
Y r u gay! 😂you are gay😂
Sorry obviously living in denial Christ was Never a sinner and obviously never Queer
Dems single handedly pushing the Trans Agenda if you don’t like Men dressed as woman in schools and men competing against women don’t vote Democrat their policies push for the Trans crap.
I truly hope this man repents and knows Jesus does still love him even in his sin. I had a good friend fall completely away from Christ when church told him Jesus hated him for being gay. Instead they should have continued to nourish his relationship with Jesus and let the Holy Spirit do what it does and change his life!

"Nobody is free of sin, not even a priest or pastor, bit I think you should at least know youre sinning. Im sinning as well everyday, like every other human, but I try as far as I can to see it as a sin and in my head I know Im doing wrong"
God has already warned this Cult teacher once with thunder yet he keeps on blaspheming God and His word. His church is of the devil not in The Body of Christ.
All the pastors that are misleading homosexuals and tell them it is ok to be gay will be hold accountable before God.
"These poor fools who try to make agreements for their lustful actions, are blind as they can be.  I hope, and pray God will show them the truth, and they will repent.  Then they will be welcome into the Kingdom of Heaven ."
James 1:14-15 our desires lead us into sin. Thank you for praying for Brandon. He may be our brother someday.
repent is all i can tell you and i will pray for you
"Foolishness….One of the reasons Sodom and Gomorrah was doomed is because of homosexuality. Ask him to read it. Also, Paul would never promote sexual immorality."
God have mercy upon us 🙏 😢 🙌 😪
Gay pastor. 😮😅<br>How is that even possible...
"Some should ask him please..”God created Adam and Eve right, so if God created Adam and another Man, would he be here today?"
He’s just gay not a pastor
He has to be so demon filled that Satan would give him literature to corrupt him.
"God knows about man lusting man that's why the verse there, bcs it happened since hundred years ago! God hate it! And this ""gay pastor"" said it's okay?!! he don't know the words of God 😒🙄 praying for his soul!"
"How can gay becomes a paster in first place when on earth , don't spoil our holy bible don't belongs to LGBTQ at all"
Blatant rejection of God's word 🥲🥲🥲
Go woke go broke Pastor
"He's correct that you have to consider historical context. Hermeneutics are INCREDIBLY important. But not in this case. It applies moreso in cases like when Paul writes to Corinth and directs women to be silent in church. That appears ONLY in that letter, despite him having written to many other churches. The reason is because in that specific church there was a female-only pagan cult that involved screaming and ripping each others clothing off and having orgies. Many young believers in the early corinthian church attempted to do this practice at first, so basically Paul was like: ""No no. That's bad. Don't let them do that, better to be silent than to cause disruption of that kind."" That is hermeneutics, this is just justification."
Do these gay pastors preaching the word of God realise what they are doing in front of God and in His house
So why would Paul have a patriarchal view… when he just said it was normal for same sex partners to practice homosexuality?? So would Paul have a different view??
Roman 1:26-27.
"The Apostle Paul is such a mighty tool in the hand of God all false teachers and false prophets like Muhammad, Allah and Islam hates Paul and tries their best to discredit his apostleship. They go after no other apostle than Paul because he addressed everything pertaining to faith, church and relationships etc."
I honestly did not get the Gay Pastor's Point.
Peter warned in his own time people were misunderstanding Paul and twisting his words to dismiss his teachings. We are now dealing with 2000 more years of those purposeful attacks on Paul’s teachings.
I believe 🤣 paul is a more prominent figure than this gay pastor false teacher
Thank you for posting this! God bless you and your journey in the ministry God has called you to fulfill.
"It's exactly as Apostle Paul says, hence the reason this gay ""pastor"" is a reprobate! Poor guy😮"
Sodom & Gormmorah was destroyed  by  fire with this kind behavior ..... immorality...
Wolf dressed up as sheep
"Wow this Guys didn't even know what he's saying, You can also apply Matthew 19:7 in this issue, God created a Man and Women for the greater purpose, and this guys perverting the OT and NT just to fit with their own prejudice and biases. Even i can fully understand the contents of Romans 1:37, even though my mother tongue isn't English, even if you read it by verse or in context its message is undeniably about the same sex marriage."
A little off topic. But where does the Bible say he'll is a place of weeping and gnashing of teeth?
"Find your identity in Christ alone. Galatians 2:20 NIV - 20 ""I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.""  It is difficult to die to self, but that is our calling. Matthew 16:24 NIV - 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, ""Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me."" When did Christians stop denying self? Can you be a disciple unless you deny yourself? There is no other Gospel than the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus and our identifying with Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection. We need to be free to our self and flesh addiction. This is a growth process and there WILL be stumbles along the way. Hear the Word of God: Galatians 5:16-25 NIV - 16 So I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. 17 For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whatever you want. 18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 19 The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; 20 idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions 21 and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law. 24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 25 Since we live by the Spirit, let us keep in step with the Spirit.

"Wait question!!!?being gay without sex? Is that lustful. I have friends who are gay but never have sex, is that still lustful or sinful?"
Be fruitful and multiply
Is this young gay pastor cherry picking to suit his lifestyle... how much of the truth can you explain away ???
The manipulate the HOLY BIBLE however they want and teach everything on their own ways. I hope they no longer have the voice to even speak at all.
The guy is loving and trying to justify his sin… I think I’ll go back to my porn addiction… not
"Bible says beware of sheep in wolves clothing. <br>He is miss leading people and he will stand before God on that and be judged. <br>Pray his eyes are open to the truth and see how many lives he has destroyed with the lies.<br>The devil comes to kill, steal and destroy."
Did the false teacher just call this guy a false teacher ……..
Gay pastor is like having a vegetarian vampire
GOD DOES NOT ANOINT PERVERT PREACHERS GOD STILL CALLS GAYS IS EVIL IN HIS EYES

Not gonna lie... it seems these non binary people all have a distinct look. 1 glance and i knew he was one of the non binary freaks
God bless you young man of God. May God bless you and your family tremendously and bless you in your ministry!
I don’t really find this interesting because that pastor is making up his own views and picking a choosing what he wants to hear. Any semi intelligent person or even someone with any common sense would see this so called pastor is ignorant. Jesus loves everyone and I pray this pastor really does find Jesus!
"Ok all this gay “ pastor” is doing is trying to hide his sin misinterpreting the Bible to fit his narrative so he doesn’t feel guilty , I did that before when I was in the “lifestyle “ which btw it is exactly that because it’s a choice  we have our own will God doesn’t force nobody to believe in Jesus"
"“The heart is deceitful above all things, And desperately wicked; Who can know it? I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, Even to give every man according to his ways, According to the fruit of his doings. jeremiah 17:9-10<br>'Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my thoughts! ' 'And see if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!' Psalm 139:23-24"
"It literally says in 1 Cor 6:9-11 list out those who will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Romans 1:27 is clearly written. I highly recommend that you don’t “debate” people who claim to be Christians but don’t follow what is written in the bible that’s like a someone who say they are a lawyer but don’t follow the law. In the end, all this have been prophesied before our time and this only confirms again that we are living in the last days"
"That gay pastor don't know an inch abt Jesus !! He is seeing him through a gay lens - that is wishful thinking, not facts."
"This Gay Pastor is blinded by Lucifer. That is why he can not see the truth and start twisting the truth just like his father Lucifer and does not want to be liable to their actions.<br><br>That is the problem when Lucifer wanted to be God, Lucifer started to have his own interpretation and started to tell the whole truth. Lucifer is trying to inrrupt the moral ground by telling the half truth to justify his own agenda."
He doesn't want to give up or admit his sin. He's trying so hard to keep it.

"Gay rights and acceptance turned into a whole different scenario than just wanted to be respected accepted and given the same rights and heterosexual people.

"So if it's only pertaining to demeaning relationships, then why doesn't it say that for women too? This dude is starting to sound like a misogynist 🤣 it specifically says ""as you do with a woman"" for a reason, which is DONT have ANY relations with the same sex 🤦‍♂️ Maybe lesbians can get away with twisting the words, men don't get any wiggle room 🤣🤷‍♂️"
The hubris! These people need to admit they don't follow Jesus and just start their own religion. God would probably have less wrath for them in the end 🤷‍♂️
This gay pastor knows he’s wrong! But the elites have him in they church to confuse and destroy for $$$
"The narrator is right on target!!! You get it!!! FROM A non practicing gay senior man!!! Because I accept the TRUTH( WORD OF GOD) I DO NOT RATIONALIZE IT TO FIT MY FORMER SINFUL BEHAVIOR!!!

IT IS A SPECTACTULAR JOURNEY, BUT WITH GOD ON OUR SIDE  IT BECOMES EVEN MORE INTERESTING  AND CHALLENGING!!!"
May God bring His marvelous light into this young man's life.
Jesus was sinless. He did not give in to temptation.  Jesus became righteousness and sacrificed himself for us so we can be right with God.
🌈🌈🌈🌈👏👏👏👏
"Bruh you just earned my subscription. Btw this gay teacher is evil from another level. How in the world are you gonna defend being gay, when the Bible is clear in MULTIPLE texts that you are not supposed to be gay. Like come on, step down from ur high horse, and continue your sin cause ur not gonna change ur bullcrap, but don’t try to use the Bible to justify ur sin, he is what the Bible would call a fool."
"Gods first commandment to man and one he made a point to elaborate as his most important command. ""Be fruitful go forth and multiply so that you may have dominion of the earth sea and air"
"I wish these supposed pastors would stop leading their followers straight to the gates of hell, evil evil evil"
"God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve!"
Temptations do not come from God
He got himself backed into a corner and started spitting out anything he could think of to claw his way out.
"The Word of God,is from Jehovah God.Not Jesus...."
This young guy is very refreshing
"The answer for this gay apostate/heretic is the CROSS. End of story. He doesn't want it? Move on. Dust off your shoes and move on. I have no time to waste with a closed heart. I will tell him the Gospel, encourage him to embrace the cross, tell him to repent and leave that nasty ""alphabet"" choice, and if he says no and tries to get me to see his lies, I move on. Very simple. It's all spelled out in Romans 1:18-32."
"I feel bad for this old man. We need to pray for him. God is not this hard to figure out. He may need the holy Spiritt to reveal to Him because he clEarly cannot see or hear Gods word that’s for us it seems so crazy he doesn’t even see himself trying so hard to have others understand . He is lost and that’s okay. We were all lost and then we were found. We should pray for this gentlemen. I pray he has a supernatural encounter it is revealed to him. There’s no point in arguing with someone this deep. The fact he is still going on and doesn’t see this as an idol is crazy. If there is anything you wouldn’t give up to include Abraham and even his own son, then it’s an idol. Jesus can ask me for anything to include my life and i would lay it down! ““Don’t waste what is holy on people who are unholy. Don’t throw your pearls to pigs! They will trample the pearls, then turn and attack you.”<br>‭‭Matthew‬ ‭7‬:‭6‬ ‭NLT‬‬<br><br><br>The word of God IS Jesus , he thought he had a pun there! This attack of the devil is real!"
"To be clear, God is not the source of temptation nor our feelings, passions, or desires. God through scripture calls us to confirm our hearts and minds to Him, the principle of which is expressed in Psalm 26: ""Vindicate me, Lord, for I have walked in my integrity, And I have trusted in the Lord without wavering. Examine me, Lord, and put me to the test; Refine my mind and my heart."""
The Bible Says Adultery itself is a sin. In fact its one of the Ten Commandments. No one gets Singled out and condemned for having sex before marriage. I think its wrong to bash people for their sexual orientation.
.
Funny how we don't see many aged homosexual couples. Maybe they're on to themselves by then!
"Problem with his argument...Jesus was working through Paul so discounting his work to further and CORRECT the churches faith, informing and teaching so discrediting Pauls account is discrediting any form of wisdom given and taught."

Gay apostate* not pastor
"No such thing as a gay ""pastor"" minister of satan, yes"
"What do y'all expect? He's the same genius who tried to twist ""Lazarus, Come out"" and use it to make it seem the Lord is encouraging delusional sexuality confused people to  Come out😂"
He looks like an actual talking satanic goat to me
The fact that he reads the bible to twist it's teachings and not even realizing how bad of a path he's going is terrifying. <br>God will hold the sheperds to a different standard than the sheep.
The blind will lead the blind
I am so worried for people. So many people are lost. The world has deemed acceptance as love.

Ok The Gravy Done Boiled Down TO THE ONIONS TO THE GAY WORLD MY PASTOR WAS GAY PASTOR YES SON WHY YALL GAY MEN CHOOSE GAY A GAY BEHIND AND NOT A. WOMANS BEHIND ITS THE SAME THING WHERE THE BOO BOO DOO DOO COME FROM
"Him purely focusing on the context is another logical phallacy. If everything ever said was taken at face value, we would learn nothing. If everything was only focusing on context, we would learn nothing. There has to be a healthy blend of those 2. He only looks at context, and therefore misses the literal meaning of the verse. Also, every other direction in Leviticus specifies the subject of why the action is sin. If it meant that the idolatry was the sin part of homosexual behavior, then it would have said so. It would have said “If in the action of idol worship, a man were to lay with another man in the same way as with a woman, it is detestable” then yes, but it doesn’t, it just says that “If a man lays with another man, it is detestable.” Ignoring basic meanings of words. Sin is bad, God is good, and we need to love those outside of the fold with just as much love as those within."
"I had relations with ""trans women"" which is basically men, and i knew it was evil, wrong, unholy. I lived in sin and enjoyed it, but i will not justify my evil ways. What i did was pure evil, period. There are no if ands or buts. The God of Abraham hates the sin i committed. I spat in the face of God and crucified Christ. No excuses. If i be forgiven, may it be in Christ."
This is how the devil works. Pretending to be of God and perverting the scripture. If it was ok it would be blatantly stated in the Bible. The Bible is crystal clear. It is about tattoos also but everyone makes excuses for them too. It’s so sad that these preachers of false doctrine have no accountability for misleading vulnerable people.
"you know years ago priests and pastors had to go to through rigorous tests like a doctor or a lawyer before they can: teach, preach, Baptise and present Holy Communion. The 12 Disciples were taught for 3 years by JESUS. Before they went out preaching. How much more do we need our pastors to be trained in the word!!! Years if not decades! <br><br>Don't get me wrong I have nothing against young pastors. I myself am 25 (Not a pastor). But 80% of them just want views, money, fame or to sell a book they wrote or merch. Seriously!!!  No! I am sick of pastors telling sheep to read their bibles but never get through a book of the bible just one line per sermon. <br><br>I read a book about a pastor in China who read whole books of the Bible in 3 hour sessions. Book of Matthew! Done! Book of Luke done!!! True teaching! Then the next day they would go into more depth about the notes they gathered. Talk and really chew the words in their minds. It is rare to find a church like this today! Not adding their spin on it but taking it as it is. <br><br>I'm not talking about believers. I'm talking about the people who teach the believers. Jesus said he will judge them more harshly. In the Book of James it also says this. It says not everyone should become a teacher because they will be judged more seriously. We need people who know the Bible inside out and who can quote it word for word. Who tries their hardest to obey it. I know nobody is perfect but there are Good and bad christians. Wise and foolish christians. Jesus said ""not everyone who says,""Lord,Lord"" will enter into the kingdom but those that do the will of my father!"""
"Homosexuality is a sin. Black and white. There is no wiggle room. Just like murder is a sin. Lying is a sin and also being proud. You know many different sins, but virtues are things like chastity, purity, love, marriage (man and woman) Truth, Humility and you know what else is a sin? Corrupting and adding or taking away from God's word."
Yes Brandon is a false teacher just as we were warned of.
No such thing as a “gay pastor”.      That would be a deceiver and a fraud.
"Like Jackie H. Perry said, ""Eve judged the tree by it's effect. It looked good, It's gonna taste good so it isn''t bad"". That was bad descernment and bad wisdom. We judge by what God has said about something through His Word"
"I wish that the LQBTQ community will come to the realisation that God doesn't hate them. He loves them. He only hates the act of same sex.<br>I wish that they will come to realisation that yes all of us is bron out of sin. Some of us is môre broken than others and we dont have control over that. But thats why we need Jesus to set us free from sin , to purify, restore and heal us"
"If Paul the apostle is wrong and the text of him is false , throw your Bible out the window because that means the whole Bible is corrupted. And in fact that’s what the ppl do! The justify themselves to God , which we know hell fire awaits those you want to justify themselves ."
"In the old days they would unalive the gay pastor . Truthfully just based on context and evidence, he would not breathe after they judged him . They would have done this from Leviticus to the time of revelation and prob up until the last 80-100 years"
"The devil also used the word of God against Jesus. Satan twisted the word of God, this man is twisting the word of God. He is no teacher of the word, he cannot even follow the world and he is rejecting these ideas from the Bible, meaning he is rejecting God"
He looks really sick like he’s lacking iron he doesn’t look healthy
Always love hearing the made up dribble he spews
"2 Timothy 4:3-4 “3 For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear. 4 They will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths”."
"God does not give us temptations, he allows it. “When tempted, no one should say, “God is tempting me.” For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each person is tempted when they are dragged away by their own evil desire and enticed.” (James‬ ‭1‬:‭13‬-‭14‬). Those temptations are your cross to bear and leave it at the feet of Jesus. Other than that good video!"
I agree with them but they also continuously interrupted Brandon and were twisting his words. It was disrespectful in my opinion.
"So if either the woman or man is unable to have children, are they forbidden from sexual relations?"
God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah for it and we’ve forever known your sinful abomination as Sodomy ……but but but but
there’s nothing wrong with being gay. we all have temptations. it’s the act of what a gay person participates in. marriage is between a man and woman
You can’t argue with a fool.
A false prophet
What about the physical appearances of lbgt people?  They have Free will and choice but how can they deal with organs of both gender.<br> eg.  Hermaphrodite etc..
There is no such thing as a GAY Pastor. This child is not a real Pastor.
Gay pastor is an oxymoron.
God never said there wouldn’t be temptations( and the temptation is from satan )however we are to resist the temptation and live according to God’s will.
"It's weird how people are afraid of this Lake of fire. I even hear kids call themselves satans and they are all going to the Lake of Fire. <br><br>Our souls are more powerful than the Angels, they become deprived when we enter into this world and sometimes trapped here forever in a never ending sinking into endless simulations. <br><br>When you worship the True God, heaven earth or hell will not be able to harm you, all these things get rid of impurities. Gold gets revealed when it enters into the fire, even Jesus chosen to head into Hell, his whole path and life was to get to Hell as soon as possible. Then, he escaped and walked on the earth for 40 days asking for meat to eat, then ascended and the witnesses said the same way he ascended is the same way he will return. <br><br>He wasn't afraid of Hell, why are all of you afraid of Hell? The children reflect their Father right, if Jesus was not afraid of Hell, and you are, that means your father is someone else, someone fearful of Hell, someone wishing to avoid Hell and run from Hell. I'm more afraid of the True God than anything else, nothing else scares me, because I know the True God can make anything a Hell or Heaven, it's not a destination it's a condition of the soul, imagine being in heaven deprived of anything to enjoy it with, your basically a ghost a hologram. <br><br>The True God is beyond the Bible and all Religions, all Religions are dependent while the True God is not dependent. :)"
It's so sad how this guy is justifying his sin and leading others away from God in his false teaching.
So sad
They're interfering against me to have a heterosexual marriage and did so.<br>They divert and attack with interpretation about context which is false.
"I am a republican Christian and do not support gay marriage, that being said, it gets old hearing everyone hyperfocus on gay marriage and homosexuals far more than any other sinful act because in doing so the church is turning away millions of people from god. We are all sinners and god does not hate their sin anymore than he hates your sin. I believe we should preach the Bible and everything in it, including homosexuality being a sin however I don't think we should emphasize homosexuality more than any other sin. If the church would stop primarily focusing on gay people I believe many more people would be led to God. Christianity isn't meant for just straight people. Side note, the gay pastor is completely wrong in his teachings and is being sacrilegious taking the Bible and twisting it to his own desires. He is dead wrong, but that doesn't mean the gay community deserves god any less that you or I."
These people in our society today are horrible false teachers who don’t worship the true Lord. They do not know Gospel in need to repent and turn away from there sin immediately. He has no clue what he claims. The Bible is anti LGBTQ and it’s horrible these false teachers who the church trusts today. We need to stand our ground and know the truth.
Thanks for sharing. Good job and God bless.
God loves us all as his children and so do I love God and all. Dear God bless us and have mercy on us🙏😘💕
Im so tired of Christians saying homosexuality is a sin. I read the Bible and consider myself a disciple of Jesus but I will never be a Christian just because you segregate perfectly healthy human beings thinking your book said it’s a sin. I agree with the pastor. Exploitative and promiscuous sex is wrong. But two people of the same sex can be in pure love and calling it a sin is just ridiculous. I won’t get baptized because I don’t want to be like Christians. I just want to be like Jesus. You make this beautiful religion divisive with this arguments. I’m so disappointed. Jesus would not allow this judgement against gay people. We need to love them not condemn them. Enough with judgement. Pray for them and leave them alone.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HDXIH8xc6c&t=590"">9:50</a> how does it not bring death when if you can’t produce offspring by the same sex, don’t you think that would lead to a huge problem world wide? 😂 god designed it to be men and women so we can procreate and have life."
This kid is good.  Glad to have you on board brother
The word is the word. Period. There is no mixing of words. It's plain and simple.
Gay Pastor? what a paradox.
strange doctrinal conflicts.  We were warned of this by the apostles that in last days there would be an increase of doctrines of demons.  I see this so-called pastor demon possessed and teaching false doctrine and twisting scripture to permit sex with same sex that is clear is against God's law!
"The church has always re-interpreted the canon to make it more fashionable and acceptable to each generation. For example it was once quite normal to follow the Bible in dealing with slaves (Numbers 31:17-18), witches (Exodus 22:18) and worshiping other gods (Exodus 22:20). Commenting as an atheist, it seems to me that logically you either obey the Bible to the letter, or you ignore it completely."
"It is NOT against God to be homosexual, I know I AM the Holy Spirit the third member of the Holy Trinity. Paul and Moses was against t Homosexuals NOT God. Amen. 🙏"
Calvanist saying he is preaching a false God. And it's true. But Calvanist believe in a False calavanist theology also. So they also are following a false god.
"Amazing, JLP 🤣😅"
"""GOD'S WORD and ""HIS!"" LAW....Are ""NEVER!!"" to be (Contradicted) nor be made (Controversial) by ""ANY!!"" Man ♂️ (nor) ""ANY!! Woman♀️GOD is ""CONTINUOUS!"" WITHOUT END....

Water and oil don’t mix ……………..
This dude must have 2fathers because his talking 💩
"Gay pastor keeps cutting them off mid conversation, getting angry , lmao bro must’ve never read James 1:19-20😂someone get dis man a Bible expeditiously"
"It's odd that they didn't push back against the argument of patriarchy by pointing out that our relationship with Jesus is framed as a bride (us) and groom (Jesus), and the groom goes and builds onto his father's house to make room for us."
I hate channels like this that sit back and watch somebody else do all the hard work in having a conversation and then they pass it off as their own by make a comment every now and then.
It is logic vs feelings.. nowadays feelings are more important... 🤦🤦🤦
"No matter however the LGBTQ affirming Christians or non Christians argue, there is no such thing as same sex marriage, regardless of what the government(s) say/approve! Cos marriage can only be binding/consummated through the act of heterosexual intercourse in the eyes of God. That is why the Bible says let no man break apart what God has brought together, and that is why it says a man shall cleave to a woman and they shall become one flesh. And that is finally why homosexuality is an abomination in the eyes of God."
That kid is so uncomfortable  and his demons are very active <br>Because he keeps interrupting the pastors<br>I don’t consider this young person as a pastor
That's the big error many people make. It IS in your control. The fact that you struggle with a strong desire means you have allowed the flesh such a strong foothold on your life that the strength of your Spirit cant break it. This leaves you open for the devil to use you in the flesh. In the Spirit you Are able to control it. But it costs much prayer and selfdicipline to come back to walking in the Spirit better.
"This is outright blasphemy and a satanic lie.Jesus is holy and will always be holy.This atheistic inundation of vile rhetoric against the Trinity(God the Father,Son snd Holy Ghost) is an evil agenda being promoted by those who despise heterosexuality and godliness."
He is totally blind..
"Jesus also says, If a man LOOKS upon a woman to LUST after her, hes commited adultery in his heart.  Adultry.  I congratulate you all for having this conversation but we all nees to look at our own sins really hard, myself included. Our Eternal Salvation is no joke."
Jesus sat with sinners. He didn't sin with them but called them to repentance
"I honestly can’t even understand how someone can be gay and Christian at the same time and call themselves real. It’s unbelievable. The Bible clearly says not to practice homosexuality and it is a detestable sin. It is mind blowing how they call themselves Christians. DO NOT believe in what these gay “pastors” say. Do not subscribe to the ways of the world, but turn to Jesus. Christ is the only way. 🙏 🙏 🙏"
"No. We did not watch them go head to head. You edited out almost the entire debate.<br><br>That’s dishonest and manipulative, so, I’m sure it’s some sort of sinning"
What can you expect from a corrupted mind
"Kamala is trying to be ""Hip"", smiling and all.<br><br>We tried to be relatable by saying ""Oh, I'm from the middle class!""<br><br>Well the middle class is struggling, me and my grandfather are struggling. We need help."
Clubbing at them diddy parties
"I would say buying $65,000 Tiffany necklace would be a guilty pleasure! lol and expensive one"
"Real Black woman here, not voting for Kamala 😂"
She called young people stupid.

Eldred Walk
Worse than cringe....if that's possible.... Trump ❤️❤️❤️❤️ 2024....🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Skumala Harris is nothing but a lier
Wake up people she is not Black
She's desperately trying to seem normal. She needs more than Doritos for that task.
lol we are not voting for Kamala or Tampon Timmy 😂
Cringe! 🎯
bro they wasn’t starring at her at all n if they did they would quickly look away
"We need to have in all the debates, one conservative and one liberal asking questions,  that's 100% equality"
You people disgust me! The fact that this election is close is a joke for our country. Your all jokes. FKH!
Ha ha ha ops 💩
Nacho flavor Doritos? That’s cultural appropriation!
Lesson to this Gnarls Barkley fits Harris perfectly
Such a FAKE..see how she tries to sound like she has a Southern Accent around black people..<br>Then put her around white people and she's asking for Grey Poupon..😂😂😂
"All she needs to do is to stop drinking so much wine, and stay silent. Because she’s pretty dumb."
Probably the main reason no sane and sober person is voting for her.
Hell who can afford Doritos or clubbing in the fkd up economy
She's lying about the friend. Special K moved to Canada when she was 12.
Clubbing with Diddy
There is only 1 kind of guy that will vote for her🙄
Nothing but how she grew up and no answers to any of the questions she is asked!!
Swapping her for Biden is  🤦‍♂️
Crooked Media
"They are thinking, Answer the Question!!!"
😂😂so much content so many answers on her policies. <br><br>Look she is pretending to be middle.  She is far far left dont be fooled by the Doritos and napkins.
The RACE IS NOT CLOSE. ITS A TRUMP LANDSLIDE. THE NWO WILL USE A CYBER ATTACK ON DIMINION AND BLAME IRAN. THEY WILL ALSO TAKE DOWN THE GRID. DARKWEB GOVERNMENT OPERATIRS ARE ALREADY PLANNING IT. STOCK UP IN EVERYTHING YOU NEED FOR A MONTH. THE DEEP STATE NWO WILL NOT ALLOW TRUMP TO TAKE OFFICE AND WILL TRY AGAIN. TRUMP ISNT A CAT.
Funny how her accent changes according to who she is talking to...
They should arrest and put her in jail. She's a threat and dangerous in AMERICA. Don't TRUST HER!
Yuk yuk yuk yuk
Bangbros
Wow she’s something else
"Well Joe C., how about that ""No Fact Checking""?  Lol, knew it would be a lie!"
"If it and its running mate get into office kiss everything you own, And the bacside you sit on goodbye!"
She is not a leader. We need a strong leader.  Her and walz do a waltz around a question. They don't answer the question? Not my vote....
On the edge of World War three and this is our possible President even right now?!
Lmao
She acts like everything is a f*<b>***</b> joke has to laugh at it
The problem is it plays well with the younger voters because she is being fake trying to act likable. It's just like a parent who doesn't discipline because they want to be your friend. Part of why we are where we are today.
"I don't eat Doritos, I eat Cheetos, and I lick my fingers, I don't need no stinking napkin!"
😂😂😂
"Anyone doing mail-in ballots, take a picture of it before sending it.  PROOF! PROOF! PROOF!"
Thought taco was original flavor.
You can tell democrates bought and paid Social Media News. Just look in Kalama back pocket.
The dogma and poison of male supremacy is very real. Kamala Harris 2024 💙💙💙
Trump will LOSE this election !!!!
Kamela Harris is not the right person for the job of American President. Or any job in government. Apparently she hasn't done well with any job in government that she's had.
She's just confused over which one she should fellate first.
"Forget men, even women find her cringe😅"
Cringe
Trump 2024
This woman’s laugh ( or whatever that is) should be enough to show people that she is not presidential…
GAG!
Walz thinks it's a good idea to have napkins around too. Feminine ones. In the boys room.
She’s trying wayy too hard 😂
"Oh, wow, now she's a cougar 😅 Well she has the looks to be one.  Esther Tryus  loves it when someone is asked a question, and they just laugh.  That's street sense. Your intellectual hypocritical geniuses wouldn't know anything about that.  😅 Cougar! 😊 🕊"
She’s a laughing clown. There is no level playing field.
Fox News is a joke
Ive been alive since 1980. Never have i seen a president run on the premise of being relatable. Its absolutely pathetic and the democratic party should be ashamed of themselves. TRUMP 2024 ❤❤❤❤❤❤
Such a fake!  Joke!
boooooo Kackala and she  suckd at everything being in charge almost 4years😢
"Oh I watched part of this interview!! It was so silly (as usual).... I think the clubbing comment, was so tacky and insulting to the interviewers! You could read their faces.... they were just like ""for real?"" LOL. She tried to be ""extra"" fake black on this interview."
These beautiful men are so much smarter than Kamala! ❤❤❤
Comrade Harris needs to go home! Enough already!
What does Doritos have to do with our election?
I could care less about your doritos. Omg seriously
"She said DOE RITOS 😆 🤣 😂 SHE IS SO F.S."""
She is such a phoney.
She reminds me of the women who treated young guys badly...just because.
"Doritos?! Who is she trying to win over? 13 year old boys? Does she really think ""ordinary people"" absolutely looooove Doritos? How condescending is that?"
Close race ?  the media lying !!! Fake news!!!!!!
Those dudes sold out and look like fools    🤣
Who is the cackler ?
Cringe? She's horrifying!
...FOX needs to be sued out of existence!!! 🙄🙄🙄
Kamala is so fake !
Harris is so  silly and  not funny she is not Presidental material for sure she is unreal the World is laughing about her
Only the dum vote for  this kamala
"She can't answer real questions, only Dorito questions.<br>Very sad. <br>She lost my vote in the first period."
It’s a Hillary playbook - remember hot sauce??
Original was taco flavor
I'm so sick of hearing her laughing. I don't know what to do.
"Harris is a dang fool. Where are Biden and Harris during this war ...Oh on the phone monitoring it. After visiting the border for 20 mins, she's handling that well too."
She is so fake.
Sick😡😡😡
She never answer's the question
Cackling nit wit 😂
The guys she's speaking with reaction says it all.
"Progress insists you hold the line, lest doubt drag past paths back into view. Consistency breeds certain faith that forward lies your due."
Kamala’s best poll work was in Willie Browns private bar.
"Trump 2024❤❤❤forget Harris, waste of time"
Everyone needs to be fact checked. <br>Trump 2024.
"Fake, fake, fake, and fake."
"She is failing miserably.... Yikes, man, them ninjas are getting paid to interview her... Who are they foolin?????"
censors continues with youtube if truth don't fit their narrative.
I just saw a picture of you and Diddy in the tub together sooooo. Yuck
"Russia, China, Iran and North Korea are shaking in their boots."
Watch Candace Owen’s as she proves Scamela is not black
Sorry kamala you haven't appealed to young male voters in at least 13 yrs!
There going to pack you off to war don't think for a second it's not so .
She's such a case!!! All she does is cackle and laugh about everything
💯❤AMERICAN ALL RED FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA = 535 ELECTORAL VOTES FOR PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.
Super cringe  and clueless and incapable to care for America  and serious matters
"💯❤PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE SUPER WIN ELECTION 2024 AT 8:OO O’CLOCK NOVEMBER 5, 2024 WHEN NEW YORK & PENNSYLVANIA IS RED BABE KAMALA."
"Parents, if she wins your kids are going to Iran 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
She is so fake and evil!!
"""May not be the right person for the job""MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT PERSON FOR THE JOB!!!!!  SHE SHOULDN'T BE A KINDER GARDEN TEACHER MUCH LESS PRESIDENT,  STOP BEING SOFT ON HER."
So cringe 🤮
Kamala Harris is SO tiny!  Hahahaha!
Red red red red guys .........too simple ......vote red down the line
Must be nice to be able to afford a bag of doritos. The rest of us starve
So SAD to see this as a prospective president. Frankly it's quite nauseating the way she's on her own bubble laughing like cringe the whole time. To be our president is  NOT FOR YOU HARRIS!!!!  Get a grip Lady!!!! Pay attention!!
the shred continues.  her word salad never has dressing on it.
I’m a 39 year old white guy and I cannot stand her!  I already sent in my mail-in ballot for Trump
Good thing she can afford Doritos on a middle class income.
"Imagine that you saw her résumé without her name, gender, or race.  Imagine that you read a transcript of one of her interviews or speeches.  You would never think for one second that she is a viable candidate for the office of President of the United States."
"It's kind of sad, really. She didn't actually ask for this, she was thrown into it, but isn't qualified..."
"Kamala shredded Trump in the debate. Just like she is going to do on Nov. 5th. Real, true American Patriots don’t vote for insurrectionists."
"kackle, kackel, kackle"
She was raised in the middle again… but that doesn’t answer the question.  Such a fake candidate.  People aren’t stupid.  Wake up America 🇺🇸!!! Vote Trump!!!🔴🔴🇺🇸🇺🇸
No one cares about her upbringing and family... enough!<br>What about american families and the crap her administration put us through these past 3.5 years????
In this video Kamala is wearing a $63 thousand dollar necklace from Tiffany so how hard does she really have it?
Never Comrade Kamala!
"I had never heard of the ""All The Smoke"" podcast before this. In the clips that have been circulating, I see them ask her a serious question and she just wastes their time with a BS non-answer and they just let it stand. They've earned zero respect and guaranteed I'll never visit their channel. They belong in line behind Emhoff and Walz."
"I'm so confused as to how half the country thinks she's the best option, it fries my brain🤯"
Notice how it's always the same handful of trolls defending comrades harris and walz
walz:::::: the coward of the country. sung to the tune of well you know
A boxing match😂
In her friends father's Cadillac Seville ....... gee my parents had a Ford Ltd and a dodge dart swinger. <br>Her eliteness is showing 😂😅
Where are the tough questions???? Kamala Harris is absolutely pathetic!!!!!!!
Imagine her negotiating war & peace with world leaders. Terrifying.
FACT - scientifically proven men listen to a small percentage of what a woman says
Do you think the stories of her chewing on sweaty underarm hair are true ?  Maybe it could explain her crazy laughing.
She answers nothing
She treats this entire nomination.. as a JOKE
Middle income Seville
"<b>“I DON’T CARE ABOUT YOU. I JUST WANT YOUR VOTE!”</b> 
<br>– Donald Trump, MAGA Rally, Las Vegas, June 2024 
<br>
<br>One of the very few true statements Don the Con ever made
<br>
<br><b>""I know a lot about overtime. I hated to give overtime. I hated it. I'd get other people in. I shouldn't say this, but I'd get other people in. I wouldn't pay.""</b> 
<br>
<br>-Donald Trump, MAGA Rally, Erie, Pennsylvania, Sept 2024
<br>
<br>At last, Donald tells us the truth about how he really feels about American working families. Don the Con is a greedy cheapskate. He despises workers and unions. 
<br>He’s using you for your $$$ and your vote. And after he’s through, he’ll betray you and throw you under the bus. Do you think he has your best interests in mind, or his own?"
"It's disgusting how Kamala changes, her voice and her demeanor, depending on who's interviewing her with these guys she did the whole black thing we ""went to the club and her dad Seville"". She makes me sick to my stomach."
Jd vance has my confidence <br>Old tim doesn't have a clue what bathroom 🚽 to use
You can't be everything to everybody.
Cackle like nails on a chalkboard
Kamala Harris has no problems with young men and Paul's show pole dance all night long for a vote from a young man she works hard for her votes
I hate how she changes her voice to attempt assimilation. It's very cringe
Trump for president
These guys got obliterated on their comments section as the name of the podcast is all the smoke and they brought no smoke ! NBA players turned softball
She is a disaster!!!!
Major Cringe! 😖
So she's been unburdened by cool ranch. Too bad everything is still overly expensive.
… and she is supposedly ahead of TRUMP in Ga…😂🤣ok.
The dreams and ambitions and aspirations and work ethic and dreams and aspirations and ambitions and work ethic of the american people.
That laugh makes me cringe
Tampon Tim and looney harris
She a joke a joke wake up people
"In my opinion, Donald Trump is afraid to debate VP Harris because she wiped the floor with him last time. She said he’s a disgrace! One can draw the conclusion that DJT is a coward for being so scared of someone who he says is mentally challenged."
Is anyone gonna ask which McDonalds?
My wife loves Doritos...I'm concerned she may change her vote now...
TRUMP2024 🇺🇲 🇺🇲 🇺🇲 Its that simple....
"How is this news? Where do I find real, substantial newsworthy content?"
"Cool Ranch Doritos, is Black People Main Guilty Pleasure Flavor"
she cant answer because it would show her and Bidens policies are a failure...she can do something if she wanted to...but she wont
"She needs to go to swing states, get a hotel room, and do a ""sleep"" for votes campaign.  It's not beyond her and we all know it."
"They know she will ""sleep"" with anyone if it helps her make it further up the ladder.  Always has, always will - just ask Willie Brown and Montell Williams (and who knows in the democrat party now)."
"She lied about weed, she arrested 2,000 people for marijuana as D.A. in California"
"What's up with Clinton and Harris, both wearing pantsuits?"
These guys are showing the Oprah cringe..
Tapon Tim gonna get his A$$ handed to him!!!
You can tell Kamala Harris is lying when she laughs as she's trying to explain whatever question is... Does anyone else see that? 🤔🤔
This is coming from a candidate that says 18 to 24 voters are stupid..
Cringe 😬
"These guys are REACHING BIG TIME, Doritos and Clubbing, she must be seeking attention from younger men 😂. <br>What a joke"
Cringe 😬
I thought she siad young adults were stupid
She’s so irritating
"Surprised she didn't whip out a Mountain Dew, good lord"
Why does she always talk about food and cooking? Middle class childhood memories and all of the sudden assumed were stupid because she's allowed to avoid questioning that we the people who she has served poorly in the past almost 4yrs can't answer a direct question with real information of her plans to take care of the damages she is responsible for in the first place?
The men who where interviewed her sounded like they wanted it over
You can tell how staged and fake this was and the amount of jump cuts in the full thing was truly horrendous.  The fact it's even been revealed they even had a teleprompter she was reading from. As for the CBS debate you know they've already leaked the questions and scripted answers to Democrats as CBS is bought and paid for like the others.
Walz is the Richard Simmons of politics
Do you agree Trump should be dictator for life in America
The Raygun of politics...and she doesn't eat doritos! Pulease!!
no fake person should ever be in the presence of these two guys. They're as real as it gets.
She nacho your president
"Now that Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris, does this signify a potential path to the first female president of the great USA? Or does she face an uphill battle against Trump?"
Maybe he ll wear her earrings.
"""NACHOS CMON CMON OLD SCHOOL GOTTA KEEP A NAPKIN NEARBY"" - KAMALA HARRIS 2024 AMERICAN VICE PRESIDENT - CLOWN OF THE YEAR"
KAMALA SAID PEOPLE 18 to 24 year olds were STUPID and that is why they put them in dorms! REMEMBER? Fact check that for yourself!🇺🇸🙏🏼🇺🇸🙌🏼
She did not grow up middle class and never coherently discusses any plans to improve the economy that her administration has tanked
Your clowns were cackling with JD Vance while you were having sword play.
Never underestimate the stupidity of identity politics!
HURRY UP NOVEMBER WE NEED TRUMP BACK NOW!!!!!!!!! TRUMP 2024 ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Talk about the draft though did she these kids getting ready for the draft go to war over and Jerusalem?
Kamala has to be the most vacuous politician in memory. There is just nothing there in her thinking. Even AOC makes more sense.
I grew up middle class… except we went clubbing in a Seville.  ?????
Any Doritos “fans” who thinks that they need to have a napkin nearby while eating Doritos are no real Doritos fans.
WW3 coming and your eating nachos? At the club?
OMGGGG 🤢
Her guilty pleasures are Marxism and the destruction of the USA.
Dude is like we have nothing.
"It is hard to imagine a candidate more unworthy to serve as president of the United States than Donald Trump. He has proved himself morally unfit for an office that asks its occupant to put the good of the nation above self-interest, He has proved himself temperamentally unfit for a role that requires the very qualities — wisdom, honesty, empathy, courage, restraint, humility, discipline — that he most lacks. Those disqualifying characteristics are compounded by everything else that limits his ability to fulfill the duties of the president: his many criminal charges, his advancing age, his fundamental lack of interest in policy and his increasingly bizarre cast of associates. This unequivocal, dispiriting truth — Donald Trump is not fit to be president — should be enough for any voter who cares about the health of our country and the stability of our democracy to deny him re-election.”"
IF YOU LIKE TO HAVE AMERICA SAVE VOTE FOR TRUMP
JD Vance called Trump an idiot do you agree
Hey Folks. Ok listen people. What is really going on here? I must ask this question too. Are we being punk’d? At least back in the day Hillary Clinton looked like a viable candidate. Kamala Harris doesn’t even seem like a serious candidate for city council let alone President. 😝
I getting jlo vibes from Kamala
Just because Biden put her there we the people dont have to vote for her !!
No human in the right mind would vote for that crap
She can't be serious
"the world does not care about your likes, dislikes and your personal life of middle class etc.... go write a book. maybe they'll read your life story.... not!!"
Convinced that she is either on meds or alcohol.  In her behaviors and speech she sounded inebriated.  Needs to be examined!
"HULU should do mini-series about her astounding rise to fame....<br>See THE AMAZING SLIDER WOMAN.....from Flipping burgers to living above a day-care!<br>Wow.! .....sign me up?<br>Yes, there will be a Sequel......""Eating Doritos in Willie Brown's bedroom."""
She doesn’t sound educated
"Kamala, America is sick and tired of hearing you answer every question about you and your life growing up & blah blah! The American citizen wants to know how you are going to help our country and make OUR lives better!! The Biden administration is a complete disgrace to this country!!!!<br>TRUMP2024🇺🇸Lets get our country back!!!!"
Trump has no chance. It should be obvious to anyone with any sense. I can't wait to see Walz embarrass Vance.
I love her❤ she will be a great president
I am nauseated by this interview 🤮
Vance has the TRUTH on his side
What is she talking about. She sounds a bit different 😬😬😬
Kamala how you gonna make America great again well i love a bag of Doritos😂😆 you cannot make this stuff up🤣😆 another meme by this fool
She was NOT. Everything out of her mouth Including McDonald's was a LIE.
She has 80% of the young vote. You guys are so desperate. 😅
"As soon as she lost, she will not do any of those accents again! lol"
This woman is pathetic!
She's so bloody childish
"I was up in the air over my choice for President, but I do love Dorito's! 🤣 Trump2024!"
Basketball players only appeal to the young people of color demographic. White guys don’t really watch the nba anymore
"So stupid, the original were taco flavor"
Omg
She is a Maoist & the last person we want in the White House.  That goes double time for her running mate Walz!!
She is annoying and the cackle is cringe.
"What is holistic government??? Tinctures, herbs stones etc….which ones end inflation… wars… the border????"
This is ABSOLUTE CRINGE😬🫠
Harris go home your evicted from our WH
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Kamala Harris is not prepared to be the President.
We cant afford doritos but glad she can
"I have met only one guy, a neighbor who claims he's voting for Harris. I'm not totally convinced as he was standing next to his gf at the time. Every other guy is standing with Trump. And I live in NJ."
"The ticket of stolen Identity and stolen valor, Harris and Walz."
That interview made me sick 🤮
Kackles laughs while hurricane victims suffer
the young males arent worthy
“I was born a middle class NBA player.”
Clubbing?  She never ever was clubbing except MAYBE showing up to one then standing there and leaving.  Cringe ... if she was actually clubbing it would have been made public to shame her if she again actually REALLY CLUBBED!
Was any of that true
She's weird
Even more reason Americans MUST NOT vote for Kamala Harris!
Does she ever talk about anything that matters or say anything intelligent? EVER?
"Many men claim to be str8, but let’s be real, they only find a male candidate appealing 🙏🏼"
"Please people, don’t vote for her if you care about your wealth and country"
Fox News is unbelievable you stand behind a liar always criticize the Democrats when will they do their job and look at it impartially
Kackle
We are on the brink of WW3 and she’s laughing about Doritos 😩 God help us
"Old persons like me have a bs radar,  too."
What a joke 😊😊😊
Joe Concho's facial expression tells it all!!!!
She is a phony !
She is a joke
Never anything important she talks about
TRUMP 2024 🇺🇸
Vance should do well
She’d rather talk bout her Doritos & clubbing like a teen instead for a 60yr old instead of stepping up to help those affected with hurricane. That’s her pleasure. This speaks volume of what she’s not qualified.
And l thought Bidet was terrible.
"She kinda stopped for awhile, but that cringe annoying laugh, is back in full force!! 🤮"
Her mother bought a 1.7 million dollar home .. that’s now worth 18 million today does not sound middle class to me.. pls do your research she wants to sound as though she relates to the average American but she doesn’t .. its all a lie!!!
Trump save America  please!!
Cring is Trump and Vance.
❤️🇺🇲❤️MAGA❤️<br>❤🇺🇲❤️ ❤️Trump-VANCE 2024❤️<br><b>Abso-HOLISTICA-lutely</b><br>❤️🇺🇲❤️
What happened to her accent again? It is not reliable that you pretend to be my group and someone else group when seeing different people
But KH they are not cho's
Born in a middle class family!
Really what a joke 🤦‼️
Its shocking that she likes Doritos? Got anything else there Joe?  <br>The only thing cringy is JD  Vance and the way he would like women to be treated like on  the Handmaids  Tale.<br>He will be put in his place tonight
"Leave your democracy better than you found it, vote her. The Republican women are the ones who will decide this election, don’t let them take your rights away…..we are not going back."
I'll never eat nacho Doritos again.
Another puff piece for kamala
Facts is all were interested in not her lies.
her voice gets on my nerves..she doesn't know how to talk professional
Story telling clown
Our country is falling. She spent more time with them than the border.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPM4x_mz9Ik&t=274"">4:34</a>  on the other side, there are millions of videos for donkeys (Dems logo) to study JD Vance. Walz will be a complete surprise since there is no interview from him. Like Kamala. They downplayed her and didnt let her talk until the debate. No one knew what she was going to come up with."
"Doritos, doesn't need any dip because she dipped at our border, dipped out of sight"
They can't find anyone that can confirm she worked at McDonald's ?
Unless it was edited she answered that 'guilty pleasure' question very quickly.   She knows the questions.
"She sounds like a person that never reads, hence has no vocabulary. And when she learns a new word like ""significance"" or ""investment"" or ""holistic"" she overuses it even where it doesn't belong."
I am a young man. I watched this interview. This woman is nuts.
"Good afternoon, ""Giggles"" lol Trump-Vance 2024!"
I can’t afford a $6-7 bag of Doritos
Kamala from da hood!
You ever notice she has man hands?
"I wont watch cbs at all<br> I will hear who won tomorrow on ""outnumbered"""
"My god, this woman is insufferable."
She went to the clubs when she was in Kindergarten?
I'm home recovering.   I have watched CBS for the past 15 hours.  I have seen 15 Kamala Harris commercials compared to 2 Trump commercials.  Thank God for FOX news!!
"Lord , have mercy"
I like Joe Concha's expression.  It is like he is almost speechless
Why is she talking like that?
"Really, people this that should be president? 😂"
We learned you need a napkin near by when eating Doritos 😮
😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
"Don't know how it's possible to give Harris ANY positive coverage, much less a majority of it. Show you how worthless the majority of news outlets are today. Just plain a waste of time to watch/listen to."
"Dems made 2 HUGE mistakes, Mummy and now Cackle on the ticket. FF this adm, we are a laughing stock. The worst mor ons!!!"
"If anyone ever asks you what the word ""condescending"" means just play this video. She might as well have asked these guys what their favorite fried chicken restaurant was. 😂"
🤢 I’d love to be middle class right now.
The Kamala Harris Amateur Hour
Young voters can’t afford Doritos because of her
"Trump haters cant even begin to say he doesnt answer questions..  It might take a little to get down to it, but she is just not even trying to answer anything!  MAGA 2024  TO BIG TO RIGGG"
This interview means absolutely nothing to helping American people. How anyone can vote for her is totally disfunctional themselves. Our country is in trouble and all she is worrying about is put out a stupid interview like this. Ladies its time to vote to help our country. Vote this disqualified woman out of the white house. Its time she goes back to California. Vote for the one that will fix their scree ups. Trump
They looked uncomfortable yes cringe
"Cheating will happen  pizza boxes on windows, broken waterpipes,flooding ,3am kamuaulka votes suddenly skyrocket as vanloads of fictitious ballots are dropped in mail by sanctuary citizens and illegal immigrants alianamericans...."
No way she can deal with other leaders. Nuts
"And her Nervous, Insecure laugh follows every stupid comment she makes.  Even those two dudes were uncomfortable."
"B S from Concha. Tell DT to refrain from the personal abuse and talk about HIS policies for once . Tell him to be a ""grown up"". for once."
Who ever votes for this person there will be a draft both men and women cause we will get involved not sure which side they will keep border open say anything to get elected we will lose everything I'm 69 seen alot of people but this is the worst
She is so fake you can tell  they are not impressed  and like please let this  interview  be over
"Wake up she is not the only one, it is a strategy used by politicians they do not answer real questions that impact the economy."
"But she can ,( giggle that helps in world affairs"
Its an insult to young men that she thinks she used to go Clubbing and loves Doritos will draw them.<br>HOW Is THAT going to reduce energy costs? Reduce Crime? Stop ILLEGAL immigration? Reduce housing costs?<br>Reduce college costs? Create Jobs?
What is the deal with that fake accent?
Fake accent word salad again 🙄
I was going to vote for Trump until I learned Harris loves Doritos.  😅
She has to be the only candidate for president that hasn't interviewed to discuss her policys
Exactly
"Now that Biden has endorsed Kamala Harris, does this signify a potential path to the first female president of the great USA? Or does she face an uphill battle against Trump?"
"Personally, I've learned a lot from Kamala...<br><br><b>Boss:</b> Do you have that project schedule completed?<br><b>Me:</b>  Look, I was raised in a middle class family....<br><br><b>Wife:</b> You didn't forget our anniversary again, did you?<br><b>Me:</b>  Look, I was raised in a middle class family...."
Just SO Cringy and Sad 🥹<br>God Help us !
"We have murderers in our country because of her. Don’t know about you, but I am having a harder time making ends meet"
"I was looking at some new polls on Real Clear Politics. At face value, they show a small Trump surge. A closer look reveals this small surge being projected by three rightwing pollsters: Trafalgar, Rasmussen, and Atlas Intel. They're so biased, they're actually more skewed than the fox news polls."
The napkin wasn't for the doritos!!!😮
Can she talk politics instead of clubbing and Doritos??
"They did not fact check trump 11 times, your a liar!"
Kamala got to win
She does not want the prices down they want to make people dependent on the Gov.
"Stacy Johnson - (facepalm) ""No! Don't tell people we're friends!"""
She won't be president. Wake up and listen to God!
"Good for you, Kakala! We can't even afford Doritos nowadays!😱"
hey talk to the Angel mom's
I can’t believe CamelToe is currently the Vice President and will possibly be the President.  This can’t be real
"That sounds like Donald Trump, I have a Concept of a plan."
What kind of questions are these? 🤪🤪
They should fact check because JD will be 💯 right and tampon Tim will be 100% wrong
"I am not a fan of Trump the man, never had any interest in him prior to his presidency. Definitely a fan of Trump the president. But boiled down to basics, I think I would enjoy a conversation with him, I don't know if we would see eye to eye on a lot of things outside of politics, but I still think it would be engaging. I think by the end of a conversation with Kamala Harris I would want to claw my eardrums out"
I wonder  what  kind  of  dressing she wants  on her  salad
"One would say, both Man are sitting but don't enjoy it, chairs to low but she is sitting in a wonderful chair,  iBoys next time speak UP for a better Chair You deserve it 🙏."
Kindergardener.never grew up
"Doritos... thinking she'll get the hispanic votes! Probably, only the Doritos owner and its employees!"
She is not conected to the alertness that some one need to answer a question. Even students have to answer the question when they are asked. Cognitive system not alert at all. Not working.
"'"" old skool original '"" .. Nacho .  wasn't original <br>Lie.!,"
It's hard to believe that a person like kamala could ever end up even being on the ticket to be commander and chief of the United States! It's mind boggling and very dangerous!! Think for yourself. How was everything when Trump was in office compared to what we have now! This great country will fall with four more years of what we have now! Vote for TRUMP IS A MUST!!!!!
"Dear friends who rely on FOX, just a friendly reminder FOX had to pay $750 MILLION for misinformation and stated under oath that<br>FOX is not a ""news"" provider, simply entertainment!"
This woman would take America to war.
"Young people know better. Remember her quoting, ""Young people are stupid."" She can't walk that back!"
Didn't know doritos paired well with vodka
Tim is scared 😅😅😂😂 having panics attacks
Harris was pretending to be Black again. Shameless Insulting Pandering.
Main stream media will swear Walz beats Vance so why bother to watch it.
President party girl.
Dog and pony show
My old boots make more sense 😂😂😂😂😂😂
"At this point I lose just as much respect for the people interviewing Harris trying to help her win the seat, they have to know Harris doesn't  have any capability of running a country.."
GO VANCE !!!❤❤❤
Minnesota thinks THEY were robbed.  Ahahahahaha.
"Sorry, I was just sick in my mouth..."
Bok bok bok bok. Looks like Joe is auditioning for a position in the Trump Swamp. Doing a good job as bootlicker clearly not talking about Trump at all. Does he know that the more people know about Kamala she is closing the gap on economy and immigration. Kamala/Walz 2024 2028.
This gave two dudes visiting a crazy aunt at the halfway house vibe. They didn't appear engaged but did appear bored and discouraged.
she seems foreign......
"I’m 23 years old and I’m voting for Trump. <br><br>Keep in mind, Harris called 18 - 29 year olds stupid. Now she’s crying for our vote."
Them two guys couldn't even look at her straight in the eyes. I mean its just a simple coversation and they still can't stand her.
Kamala was taught to keep a napkin Handy by Old Willie
That is not cringe. It is very relatable.
Now joe will resign because of war and she will be the democrats appointed president
Fake whatever she is trying to sound hip
"What does friends, clubbing and her favorite chip snacks have to do with leading the World?  Obviously she is desperately trying to make friends but last time I looked that's not necessarily a qualification to lead the US let alone the World but then she can always default to her Pronouns which will leave our Enemies shaking in their shoes."
This is a crap conversation. I’m not interested with her doritos. There are more important and urgent things to talk about
Disgusting ! I CRINGED ! Doritos pissed me off !
She's not eating no Doritos!! She needs to stop lying!!! Everybody doesn't eat Doritos or smoke Marijuana!!
She needs to go back to San Francisco or French Canada
"If Kamala Harris told the truth about who she is, and what her agenda is, her  candidacy would be over..  That is why she never answers directly.  Donald Harris, her father, is a Marxist professor in economics."
You can tell the guys can sense Kamala’s fakeness. They can hardly make eye contact. Cringe level 1000.
Nah. She’s not like US. 👎🏾
Kamala Harris ended her career when Biden told to go to protect the border and she said no and went home instead.
I'm not voting for ANYONE who won't take questions LIVE from on fox news. If she can't handle fox news she can't handle Putin!
And she wants to be the President? Are you kidding me? 🤬 the people are devastated by the effects of this hurricane and soon we will be affected by the port strike and she is just talking nonsense!! 🤮🤮🤮🙄🙄🙄🙄
Talking about Doritos with war in the Middle East and people in a national emergency in North Carolina Florida etc
What a disgrace and waste of perfectly good air. Blah blah blah.. only 4 weeks to go! TRUMP/VANCE 2024❤❤
She’s is the biggest joke!
"Tell it like it is! Who put people in cages and separated families when president, wants a mass deportation if elected, & stacked the courts to take away all our rights?! Not Kamala!"
Anyone fact checking klacky??
She makes me uncomfortable
What has Rump said about making ends meet? Oh yeah Drill baby Drill. Which is a term from the only Black Republican that tried to steer the party in a direction that tossed him out because of the color of his skin not the content of his character. This phrase will come up again during the election and not one of the people who say this has the actual album of the March on Washington
"She has No concept, No ideas,  No policy's,  No answers..... Just rehearsed words/ word salads and stealing other people's ideas.  And now,  we have attacks going on in the middle east less that 24 hours after biden said there needs to be a cease fire immediately."
And Trump wasn’t Presidential 😂😂😂😂
Touchette
"Kamala’s the bad vice president in history. She doesn’t have any talent , she only knows copying from others. She should be shameful herself in front of the American people. We vote for Trump- Vance"
What Indian food isn't her favorite?
Not doing fact check it's a mistake. JD Vance is a bloody liar
"She probably would tell you she started eating Doritos while she was working at McDonalds. Oh wait, McDonalds doesn't sell Doritos!"
Liar!
"Wow,who would want her to be the commander of the strongest country in the world"
Majority of comments didn't go in her favor.
She says the same thing over and over repeat yourself
Omg that suit. BwaAaaaaaaa
Cringe
The alternative is a78 year old bitter angry serial criminal.
She supports marxism…not good for the country and the Americans and the whole world!
The two interviewers are playing to her. No tuff questions
"I want to see someone toss these T-ball questions at Donald Trump. Because he is an adult who has held serious jobs and has been a true leader, I don't think he would dignify them with lengthy answers."
"Yesterday Kellyanne Conway said on FOX that she believes Trump will debate Kamala one more time after he watches tonight's VP debate.    I really hope Kellyanne is right about that, but personally I doubt the coward will do it.   It actually would be a disaster for him to do, and surprising that Kellyanne seems to want him to.   LOL LOL LOL     Obviously Trump would have debated Biden seven days a week right up to election day if he could, but for good reason Trump is terrified of facing Kamala again, as he should be!   LOL LOL    I love the world laughing at the coward!       GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!!"
"The world is going up in flames and they're asking questions about Doritos???? As Kamala says ""Walz don't work"". Trump/Vance 2024"
Common sense people vote Trump
For is for fairies
"She has no substance, even her laugh is not real"
Two colwns
She is very getto
"Kam-Mullah ,YOUR FIRED!"
She is not real
"Doritos? Has the VP of the USA nothing important to say, ever?"
She is nit real
She is a joke
She is a joke
"I honestly dont understand how anybody is supporting Kamala. She has ruined Amrica and has made it completely DANGEROUS!! I dont always like how up front President Trump is, but he is willing to risk his life to save this country... That's what we need!!"
She laughs all day she’s definitely doped up on somethin
"I don’t get it… Why would Jesus protect a rapist? A thief? A liar? A con man? A rich person hoodwinking poor people to send him their hard-earned money, to buy Bibles he has signed?"
"Hard hitting interview! Also, she’s wearing a $60k Tiffany necklace - how’s that for a middle class girl?"
That whole interview was so awkward/cringe 😖😖😖😣
"Harris praises Doritos, while Kennedy, working with the Trump campaign, is talking about the dangerous ingredients in processed foods. But Harris is the more serious candidate."
She is so hars to look at and listen too
"If JD Vance doesn't win this debate against Tim Walz, then Trump might  need to accept Kamala Harris's second debate challenge."
Trump says Kemp can’t reach Biden for help. And then we see footage where Kemp says he has all the helps he needs from the feds. Trump is pure lies.
Young real men will just find her annoying
I move for a vote of no confidence
"Rudy Giuliani's Daughter Implores Voters To Dump Trump In Poignant Essay About Her Dad
<br>“Take it from me, Trump destroys everything he touches,"" wrote Caroline Rose Giuliani."
God I can't stand her
I wish I could still afford Doritos.
Yikes. A North America led by Trudeau and Harris?
Whats your favorite jelly donut😂
"Come On, Man"
Sad part the bag of Doritos would be a better independent option than Kamala 😬😬😬😬😬🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😎👍👍
If Walz borrows Kamala’s pearl earrings he might have a snowball’s chance in hell😂
I own socks that are smarter than Harris.
Well the fake accent is back I hear 🤦‍♀️🤪
Vote for Trump Vance 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 2024
A napkin for Doritos 😂
"Yes indeed they sent someone to my house to target my 20 years old to vote for Kamala, like Kamala stated young people are stupid,my son is not stupid, he graduate high school at 17 years old with his associate in art degree from College. My son is smart enough, he took math in college so my son understand economy well"
May God help us and remove her. She’s dangerous for sure.😡
"I was pleasantly surprised that FOX news called out Trump for his blatant lying about the Biden administration's response to the hurricane disaster.    As usual Trump spewed total lies and I guess FOX is tired of getting sued for supporting Trump's lies so felt compelled to call him out!     We definitely need more of that.   Trump can and does lie to his cult dozens of times every day, but the sane people deserve better, and I am proud of FOX for calling him out for these lies!       GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!!"
She thinks all young men are now eating massive amounts of TOFU! 😂🤣😂
Hats off to this guy for watching the whole interview. I can not listen to this woman anymore.
Plain Doritios (which they do not make anymore best I can tell) were the original.  Not Nacho flavor.<br><br>Harris is old enough to know that.
"HOW IS THIS PRESIDENTIAL RACE SO CLOSE!?!? I don't get it, at all! She... Is... A... Horrible person"
A country needs a leader not a jester
If young men ever want to own a home they would never consider voting for her socialist policies that she won’t even share with the public because the policies are so scary
She's still cackling
She makes baby huey look like Albert Einstein. Im with Trump 100%
She's  great.  Thank God there's  a grown up running
She’ll win because they’ll cheat again with the ballet drops at 2-3 am
"How about condoms, tattoos, pot, body piercing"
Not an interview-cringe!! She lied about middle class again!!! Came from a privileged family in Canada-her neighbor showed the house she lived in-not middle-class . Her Mother was a Scientist!!! Father professor!
"Who is this old lady 😢 she's not in her right mind, Poison Ivy Harris Absolutely Nothing Done"
"Kamala is ""shredded"" but DonOLD gives us ""they're eating the dogs and cats,"" give the cops one ""very violent hour"" with shoplifters, the ""world is ending if I don't get elected,"" and that's completely normal."
I'm a democrat in the she's not presidential material. On knowledgeable have another brand where to buy a pass for you that's what I thought time to give the country a break American desserts the best don't let them use that abortion they don't care about you an abortion do not illegal what's up to every individual state what's the percentage of that don't make that your it's each state individual and it will never band thumbs down to your governor

She is delusional
Where’s “Corn Pop” when you need him? 😂
Just watching her hand movement shows many hours of rehearsals. To me this is new. She never really did that before she was placed as the nominee.<br>She has no plan.<br>She's nothing but a puppet.
CHRISTIANS FOR KAMALA 🙏🏼🙏🏼
The stench of impending doom is rife in these comments.
Dang I’m so sick of that laugh
I can’t stand her !
Embarrassing
THE JOKER 🃏 LAUGHING QUEEN!!!!🤡
Kamala and the democrats are doing all the heavy lifting while republicans are holding meaningless hearings in the House.
Tim looks like a goof next to JD 😅 lol im sorry but JD can really get cookin!!!
"Well, the ice cream questions worked for Biden so they figure doritoes will work for Harris. These people don't even eat right. We need a healthy America (RFK Jr.)<br>Vote TRUMP and his dream team 🇺🇸."
“18-24 year olds are stupid” 😂😅 Pro War 0 votes Kamala Harris said that!
Oh please... What the heck am I seeing... Ven diagrams?<br><br>As for the VP debate... Wonder of we going to see another 'that's my dad...' moment 😂
Biden and Ice cream is to Kamala and Doritos
I want to know about the McDonald's lie. It's a huge red flag.
For all of you young men out there beware!!!
Harris lied 23 times in the debate don't ask what lies you know them......ok lefties now you can resort to name calling with no substance
"All JD has to do is answer the questions clearly, like he has been doing with these questions he has taken from CNN & other liberal media."
"Oh, Dear God.😮"
Cackling repeats redundantly as usual !!🤔
"Why won't one single person ask her about the Mark lie. Date , year , location , and a simple social security work statement history?"
I will never eat Doritos again
If DJT tries to interfere with our nation and attempt to subvert an election and cause a riot. I say arrest him on the spot. Be ready for this sick fake con man.
the kackler strikes again.
“I be up in dat nacho I do declare!” - Camela Hurrus
Where are her critical thinking skills?
She has forgotten most of those club kids can’t even afford to get into the clubs or even the bag of Dorito right now
This is the best Obama can come up with?
Our American Black community men control the outcome of Georgia and possibly the destiny of our country.🙏🏼🇱🇷
Kamala Harris 47th 💙 🇺🇸
Lady please 👋👋👋
Vote for Trump if you want to end overtime pay!
The bot harris supporters are out I see
"Lmao, Joe Concha did not look amused by her.    More like sickened!"
If Harris wins it means that we've surrendered our country without a fight.
President and vice do nothing...   Impeach Biden and Harris
"Those two guys are wishing they were somewhere , anywhere else  besides sitting in on the Kami show !!! You can see it in there faces !!! A never again moment for them I'm sure !!!  Just an observation"
"It's like she spoke ""Christmas""!  How dare she speak ""Doritos"" in an ongoing disaster rescue effort?!"
So she can answer a question! She likes Nacho flavored Doritos.
“Right”?
"If you only want women to make decisions about their own bodies, let men decide who they want to vote for. You can still vote for Harris, but you can’t force a trump supporter to vote Harris."
I think a lot of democrats won't tell you they're voting Trump.
That nauseous laughing hurts the ears.
This interview is yet another campaign ad for Trump!
"What a stupid interview, meanwhile trump talks to Dave Ramsey about ideas while she hides away."
She is unfit as VP and she cannot become President.   TRUMP 2024
I prefer the kentucky tennessee southern accent than your horrible new York accents
How fake she is
"Hmmm, those NBA relics talking to Harris are part of the 1%. Harris is deservedly her own worst enemy.  Let her keep talking. 😂😂😂😂😂😂 SAVE AMERICA 🇺🇸"
Who tf eats Doritos with a napkin ?😂 she is so weird
Doritos are poison..so is she
Don't forget the hot sauce for those Doritos.
"First thing they will do IS Fact check in a round about way , trust me they can't help themselves"
"Those guy’s faces said everything, GO VOTE TRUMP/VANCE❤️🇺🇸"
Doh-Reee-Toes
One Groovy Gal ! ?
No young male is going to vote for anyone who’s going to draft them to fight the Democrats war!
"Democrats don't care! They think she and the administration will just figure it out after she's elected. However, I don't expect a good choice and action by her or the democrats if she's elected. ."
Grabbing a bag of nasty Nacho Doritos always solves my middle class family problems.  lol!
I have fond memories of doritos too! Yall remember the good old days when they weren't $7 a bag!!!!!
"Shameful, fakes, lies. Young man, stoned, scary lady"
Foxnews ku klux klan news network
🥴...<br><br><br>Take a moment and let that sink in❗<br><br>NUFF SAID
She is sooo fake
Cringe lol that’s being polite.
She is hollistically clear !!!
All hands on deck for this vote people vote of a lifetime. If this crazy left women gets in this country as we know it is toast. NC women here for TRUMP along with all my friends and family. VOTE VOTE VOTE our lives depend on it!!!
"Come on everybody, thisssss can't be president. Wake up everybody. Really!!!!"
She went to clubs with Montel Williams
"Pancakes, bacon, collards in the bathtub and doritos! It the ECONOMY STUPID!"
I like Doritos also.But i still dont like Kamala's policies.🤣😂👎
I’m sure she can win over young man if she pulls a WillyBrown maybe Homeland security needs to look on those tapes from P. Diddy’s parties. Obama I heard was on there possibly Kamala too
DORITOS are fully baked KAMALA is not even half baked. 😂🙃🤪
Watching Kakola is starting to make me physically ill.
"She's simply not good in front of a camera or a mic, enough said."
Doritos must pair well with boxed white zinfandel. Classy 😂
FOX is pathetic.
"GA, FL, SC, NC, apply for FEMA assistance.  Ignore fox and Doni lies, governors say they are being provided everything they request."
"Most of the youth she is trying to reach are college students/educated,  they need answers."
"If she keeps shakin’her money maker, she just might get their vote."
Why can’t Trump give any specifics about his plans?
I knew the first time she opened her mouth that she was not qualified! What are people/voters waiting for her to say??! She is NOT qualified. Period.<br>TRUMP Vance 🇺🇸 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
"Who else would still want to be her friend anyway, the nanny?"
Who thinks Harris is 1000X worse than Biden)??
I cannot listen and watch her!
I’m so impressed with her scripted answers 😂
"Black, millennial, married man. My wife and I are both 28. We were both loyal Democrats, voting for Hillary in 2016. I voted for Trump in 2020 and my wife Biden. Now, in 2024, we are both voting Trump in a swing state. The major reason I stopped supporting the Democratic party is due to their embrace of transgender ideology, supporting men in women's bathrooms and sports and Democrats, such as in my former home state of California, diluting parents rights. Becoming a father changed everything for me in how I look at the world and my role in shaping my children's upbringing. I have two toddler sons and another on the way. I don't want them growing up in a world where half the country cannot tell us what a woman or man is."
Remember Harris said 18–24-year-olds are stupid. Don't prove her right. Vote Trump 2024!
👹She didn't say anything anything about Willie Brown I guess she's keeping him a secret 👺
She knows nothing about Doritos (or anything else) because the original flavor was Toasted Corn followed by Taco.
How can anybody vote for her?
Is it possible for her to have a conversation without cackling constantly? Is it?!!
I think her staff probably does give her stuff to look at and she doesn’t look at it. She’s lazy and they’re probably scared of her. We’ve heard from staff that she’s a soul crushing bully.
Asking the 60 year old hair die champion for his opinion on whether it’s resonating with young men 😂😂😂 Go Fox go!! 😅
So what you like Doritos 😄...and
<b>REPUBLICANS FOR KAMALA</b>
The world is on fire and her and Joe have zero accomplishments... There's nobody in the White House.
Kamal evil who cares about your fake stories. All lies 😂
🇺🇲 Donald Trump 🇺🇲<br>He's got my vote and support  !!!!<br>A real American president that's supports the people of the united states not a lying politician like Harris
Lol<br>My kids want nothing to do with her
Ah….Fox News with the negative spin.
"That's OK. She's still going to win. You know it, as much as you might deny it outwardly."
And how can maga's vote for someone who lied about working at McDonald's! Right fox? 😂😅
She betta thank a basketball playa!
this is so cringeworthy - these ball players aren't buying her at all- the one player didn't even look at her...
The only thing sillier than Harris are those supporting her.
FOX News is getting desperate to make their uneducated audience think Harris is not running away with this election.
"Just asked Alexa to translate her responses,  still waiting..."
Harris / Walz 2024! 💙 Trump Prison 2024! He's almost 100 years old - and appealing to young male voters?
"Liar, you buried your cackle for a while. Put it away again!"
She believes that rigging the machines again sets her on the throne but not this time.
A big day November 5th  Patriots vs Steelers
"KAMALA HARRIS , HELL NO !!<br>United States will be in trouble if she's president !!!!!!!"
Love JD Vance!👍
When will Kamala grow up and talk about the country????
"What the world thinks - Pew
<br>Biden 75% 2022
<br>Kamala 55%  2022
<br>Trump 17%  2020"
Her career as a politician is over… 😂😂😂
"Any US felon can enter the United Kingdom if their conviction is considered spent. Spent refers to those that happened over 10 years ago.
<br>WAHEY!!!! No more Donnie!"
Young voters are rfegistering in droves - and they tend not to be brain dead.
🗨 Harris 🗨<br>Daw hum  see you in tea. 👍
"Young male voters, especially the no college type, are set in their ways like their parents. And if their parents are Republican, there's nothing Harris can say that will change their minds."
"The ""OG"" is Taco flavored Doritos...nacho did not exist"
"Tim Walz, just like Kamala Harris, and Joe Bud absolutely horrifying the disgusting"
I'm going with vomit🤮
They were baiting her for that accent lol
Trump lied about Project 2025. He really would use it as a guideline for his administration.
Happy 💯 birthday to Jimmy Carter!<br><br>I hope he gets his wish to congratulate Madame President in 35 days.
"Erdogan:UN must stop Israel,even byforce"
God forbid they should ask her a political question!!
Tough question.
"How are you going to lower costs? ""Free doritos for all."" 🤪"
"Young male voters, if they are smart enough, don't vote for a lying HATE show that Trump puts on every day of his life.  Integrity always matters, and it should matter to men of all backgrounds, races, ethnicities, orientations, etc.  Democrats have done better economically, care about the cost of college loans, and both parties are pushing for more funding for vocational training."
Trump2024 all the way
She called 18-26 year olds stupid. Ought to learn not to vote for her
This woman is DANGEROUS for our country!!!!!!
Trump 2024🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉FKH
"When are the main stream media news outlets going to be held to telling the FULL  story? Not just the Democratic point of view! Net Flix just got their biggest subscription cancelation ever!  ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC, hopefully will fall as well, for airing only Democratic coverage, and NOT Republican coverage! They NEED  to start covering BOTH <br>Democrats and Republicans! They should worry, come Nov. 6th of their future in staying in business! Tell the FULL story or fade away!"
She said she is blessed. LOL. What a joke . I don't believe that evil is blessed.
"What is up with these ""interviews"" with absolutely ZERO substance!?! Who cares about her favorite chips, or night clubs! How is she going to fix what SHE and Grandpa Joe Broke!?! You know who cares about her favorite chip? People who don't vote! 12 year olds, and 35 year olds living in mommy's basement."
Texas going Blue 💙💙💙
"If you don't have cable or internet..the news you hear is fake news but you don't no it, I was guilty of no time. Now retired I  have time & internet  I see all the BS.I can many  many more  still  only hear fake news  and believe it!Why else listen to Harris?INTERNET should  be free!"
Whats amazing is she can afford doritos while all of the rest of us have to cut chips out of our grocery list because we cant afford them. thanks a lot Biden/Harris
Wow ! she eats Doritos just like me ? If I find out she also likes pizza I’m Forgetting everything else and voting for her
"word sal·ad
<br>[wərd ˈsaləd]
<br>noun
<br>a confused or unintelligible mixture of seemingly random words and phrases, specifically (in psychiatry) as a form of speech indicative of advanced schizophrenia."
"my boss laughed so hard when he asked me about my monthly report and I responded with, ""You know.. I grew up as a middle class kid.. and I grew up in the neighborhood of people who love their lawn... so if when we talk about the significance of the passage of time... you will know the significance of the passage of time..."""
Fact Checking should only be done by the ones running for office and the mod squads
Doritos? Really? The world is burning for heaven's sake!!!
The house is shredding everything it can to make America worst again.
So Iran hasn't been able to land a single missile in any populated area in Israel? Doesn't sound like they're much of a threat. No need for any overblown reaction. Get smart.
Is it too much to ask Donald Trump to STOP LYING ?
💙💙💙 TRUMP 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Trump now more than ever!!
"Cringe, In a recent speech Trump claimed he has a better beach body than Joe Biden - Trump is nuts and tacky, and so unpresidential!"
She's clueless  I'm literally so scared if she wins
VANCE VANCE VANCE 2024 VP 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸❤️❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Wow hard hitting questions on that interview….
Im voting for common sense <br>President Trump
So cringe
"I wonder how long it's gonna be before Kamala starts saying, ya nah what sayin."
Those men DEBASED themselves!!! What cringe 🤮
I don't care call Kamala Harris grew up in the middle age household I don't care
"It's odd, VP Harris reminds me of that Seinfeld episode 2 face, away from light pretty, in direct light OMG augh!"
Good old giggles
Kamala doesn't even make it up halfway on the 'Peter Principle' competency scale.
make america straight again
She just sounds like someone's boozy aunt... all the time.
JD Vance is smart 👌
Go Vance!!!!!
she just is a power grabber
She is constantly laughing. Never stops smiling then laughing again. She is bizarre.
"!!I recently sold some of my long-term position and currently sitting on about 250k, do you think Nvidia is a good buy right now or I have I missed out on a crucial buy period, any good stock recommendation on great performing stocks or Crypto will be appreciated."
She should run for Dorito queen
"How many times did she say, “Ya know”?????"
"Actually, Taco flavor Doritos were the first flavor. Nacho came later. J.S."
SHE MAKES GOOFY LOOK SMART.
Kamala confused Doritos with crack.
Hilary’s puppet Kamala cannot speak about what she does not know!  It’s time to step up and grab the reins because this is a run away government heading over a cliff!
"I am young male , I will NEVER vote for Harris !!!!"
"Hillary Clinton said some ""very bad news about Kamala"" will come out this month. She called it the ""October surprise""."
"They needed more time to train Kamala, this is a rock and this is a stick LOL"
The new silent majority will be former Trump supporting women who have soured on Trump and will secretly vote for Harris at the ballot box.  “Yeah honey I voted for Trump. -wink-“  all these MAGA dudes about to be sold out by their own spouses.
That HORRID laugh. 😖
"Inflation, inflation, inflation and she helped create it and Kamala would rather ignore it."
We can’t have her in Office 👎 keep politics away from SPORTS.  In the name of JESUS CHRIST please do not allow her as PRESIDENT. I WILL STAND BY JESUS 🙏
She’s not a smart person.
"Harris/Walz will increase the burden on the American working class tax payers by 5 Trillion dollars from ""Day One"""
"Voting is just like driving
<br>To go backward, choose R.
<br>To go forward, choose D."
"A vote for Harris is a vote for communist Marxist, Third World country BS"
Kamala  = Communism
Vote to big to rig
Harris 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢
Again... Out of all the important and meaningful questions that could be asked... And she's having a conversation about tortilla chips... Lord help us. Trump 2024
I'm white and can talk more black than she can I grew up on the south side
She definitely does not deserve the presidency… she is woke!!😂
Why does she have to laugh about everything?  While people are dying here and in other countries. . . disgusting!
My guilty pleasure is sour diesel.
"I don’t even believe she “grew up in a middle class family”.  She even lies about this.  Can’t trust her about anything, except maybe her food likes."
"Trump says talyor swift is voting for him, how could he possibly lose,"
My 20 yr old son can’t stand her and he is hyped up to vote for Trump as his first time voting ever! Economy and secure border are his top concerns and he has actually done his homework. Trump 2024!!!
Trump 2024
What is a doe-ritos?
Trump 2024. Trump embraces those he disagrees with while harris and walz to flip off anyone not voting for them
And this number is gonna keep the world safe ???
Whats bothersome is her confidence- is this a plan to steal ?
CRINGE JEAN PIERRE!!! -- bigly
She doesn't have to answer. There is a plan and it's starting to become clearer what that plan is.
Cringe
Dont trust  her vote for  mr. Trump ❤
What  is  that crazy  woman  on Trump  2o24
Those guys look like they wanna walk outa there.
She can issue some hyena crypto tokens
Fox is pretty desperate right now. <br>😂😂😂
Trump has nothing to offer to Americans.
She in way over her head
"Harris/Walz will increase the burden on the American working class tax payers by 5 Trillion dollars from ""Day One"""
So dumb
Accent check!...
Bet there were footprints on the headliner of that Seville
Those comments were hilarious 😂
She is everything to everyone. She thinks we’re stupid. We don’t like people bc they pretend to like everything we do. What is this middle school?
"One word, sick. This is as good as it gets."
I LIKE DORITOS TOO ....THATS IT....I AM VOTING FOR HER BECAUSE SHE EATS THE SAME SNACK CHIPS AS ME!!!!😢😢😢😢
My good god ....
Just watch the peoples faces who interviews her… you can see it all over their faces that she is not it
"For World Peace, American Success, Personal Wealth and a Healthy Economy I will vote President Trump and a straight Republican ticket"
Fox News is totally lost unless they are talking about butt chugging Bud Light.
Trump 2024
"They, those two man, where so uncomfortable with her not answer the questions, they laughed not naturally 😅"
"Didn't think she was that crazy, but ......"
Doritos?<br>Really?<br>Is this some kind of joke?<br>I don’t get it.
She so fly.... cringe.
"It's true. <br>Been a joke for a while around here to give the ""I grew up in a middle class family"" answer to questions."
Yuck!! 🤢 I’m sorry
Trump 2024 🇺🇲
Trump was asked how he’d make childcare more affordable and his response was tariffs. 🤦‍♂️
"She don't eat no doritoes, everyone knows you lick the powder off your fingers lmao"
What a tough interview; Trump goes on interviews where the people interviewing him hates his guts.
"With world events linning up and happening presently, young males don't feel safe of her leadership because they are the ones that will be DRAFTED"
"it does not matter what she does or says, Not a single American will vote for Kamala, they will all vote for or against Trump.."
Stacey Johnson...goofy as can be
Cringe was Trump on Aidin Ross’s weird podcast show. That was the cringe appeal to young voters lol.
she don't eat doritos. the napkin nearby don't get ALL that spice off the fingers or the lips...
So cringy
lol MAGA and conservatives are panicking if this is the type of “news” segment they’re airing with a little over a month until election night.
"Donald Trump, the guy with the EMPTY tool bag is going to fix things… 😂😂👏👏"
Gen-Z Mexican American From Orange County California voting for Trump ❤️🇲🇽🇺🇸🙏🏽
Factchecking Donald Trump is a full time job for some people that also pays very well.
Kamala loves the polls.  All sizes and colors.

"In my opinion it’s very clear to me that because she’s a celeb (and all celebs are used to push agendaz on mainstream) they got her hitched in a fake relationship (as most celebz) have to a man who will silenceHer. I think she must have really low self esteem to be with a man who’s shown signz of being controlling. I feel bad for her and anyone with that much weight because often it’s depression. MaIezlike this would be better unaIiv, it would be better for the planet and the children if they were nothere. Glad she got out ! This is not uncommon, most women deal with this sh on a daily basis that’s why we no longer talk to em on the internet and especially don’t do dating apps."

"Hey layze, I just wanted to tell you why they got married so fast, but before that the guy in the video is doing sins and it is prohibited in Islam to do such things. But the reason why Muslims get married so fast is, because in Islam  Muslims are prohibited from dating and touching the other gender (as in shaking hands and etc). So instead the guy meets the girls family and asks for her hand and they get to know each other, and after around 2-6 months or so they end up doing Nikkah (religious marriage) so that they can be married through religion and now can finally hold hands and stuff, and then 1 month to 1-2 weeks later we usually have weddings."

"I’m a dessert kind of girl too (in regards to unhealthy vices) vs salty stuff…. though if it comes to shrimp or lobster or Alaskan king crab… That is probably on my top-tier list of foods to eat besides sweets. Followed by some snickerdoodle or chocolate chip cookies, or some sour gummy candy and then a nice big bowl of berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries). Definitely not healthy stuff besides the berries and shrimp/lobster/king crab (though I love dipping those seafood dishes in butter so that’s probably not the healthiest either). Garlic butter shrimp/lobster. Nom nom!!!Anyway…"

"Layze posted on my birthday, truly the ultimate gift!!"
Layne please be aware she’s an animal abuser.  She knowingly let her elderly cats claws grow into her pads.  She withheld food from the cat so the vet would be more likely to euthanize her.  She’s  pumping her current cat full of drugs so she won’t go into heat instead of getting her spayed.
"Anyone in the comments saying they feel bad for Foodie clearly doesn't know anything about her. If you did, you wouldn't feel even a shred of sympathy for her. She is quite possibly one of the most evil, psychotic, unhygienic, and abusive people on the planet. Youtube won't allow me to say what she's done to animals. Let's just say she thinks it's hilarious to play ""real life frogger"" with her car and assorted species of wildlife. And that's not even mentioning what she's done to her pets."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyJkPvzjVH8&t=64"">1:04</a> YASSSSSSSSSS SLAYYYYYYYYY"
I go to Wendy’s for their salads they are so good
"She would be funny to watch, too bad she is an animal abuser that left her senior cat to suffer all kinds of treatable sicknesses and let her claws get so long, they curled up under in her paw pads. 😔"

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyJkPvzjVH8&t=103"">1:43</a> idk why but i just decided to calculate how much that would be each minute<br><br>$500 for 4 hours, means that you divide 500 ÷ 4 which equals to $125. that is how much you have to pay for each hour of the flight. now take 125 and divide it by 60, which is how many minutes are in an hour. the results is a coma and a lot of numbers behind it, so how much you would need to pay is <b><i>2 dollars and a few cents</i></b> for every minute (i don't live in America so i don't really know how the currency is there). and uhh, since they've been breathing for 5 minutes, that's approximately $10"
"I eat breakfast everyday on 7am maximum, wdym 😂 I live faraway from school so I have to stomach food as early as possible (I don't skip breakfast). But well... I guess I won't eat THAT much all the time. But it's not out of the menu to have a plate of spaghetti once in while for breakfast 😋"

all i can say is damn
Sky News needs to mind their own business instead of spreading lies. Talk about bias!
Lohistic
"Kamala is like a child, practising  the use of a new addition to her infant level vocabulary! 😅"
If she wins that will be fine end of the country
Shes lying
Oh Boy...
You can tell when kamala lies everytime she opens her mouth
I love you Sky News!!  So truthful!!
"Kamala never seems to come up with any FACTS, FIGURES, STRATEGIES and PLANS! Moreover,  WHAT  has she actually DONE  or ACHIEVED in the past 4 years? 😮"
"I have to ask and wonder, what, if anything, is going on in the space between this woman's ear? If one gave this sort of vacuous answer or reply in any interview for a job of substance, they would politely shake your hand and never contact you again. Considering she is contesting for the top job in Western democracy is beyond belief that these interviewers give her such an easy ride, and, moreover, she thinks she is capable and eligible to stand for the presidency."
"HOLISTICLY speaking , wheh 10% when BINEN WAS COHERENT was better then wordsalad ( but mind salad ) of harris .  FROM INSIDE SOURCES , DEMON RATS think TO BRING BACK BIDEN FOR MORE CHANCES"
Where did she buy her degree
"Im a democrat and I dont like this woman. She should not even be the nominee, she wasnt voted in. I thought this was a democracy."
"We have always been hard working people and now we're Seniors.   We've worked hard for our America and now She's so deep in debt that it's becoming a nightmare!   In God I trust and our America needs Trump and Vance help to save our country and lead Her back to prosperity for ""WE THE PEOPLE"" 2024! 🇺🇲❤️🙏❤️🇺🇲"
"If American people choose her to lead their country,  God bless America !"
She is only a pawn. She has to do as the elites say. Our nation is stumbling downwards. We need a leader that listens to and does as We The People need. Not what other leaders or billionaires want.
"kamalala literally slept her way to the top, she didn't need any other competence or 'policies'."
"when you go woke, the nation goes broke"
"She's hasn't raped, tried to over throw gov. Stole millions of dollars,or doesn't have  34 felons🔵🔵🔵🔵💙💙"
🤮 Kamala 😂
All lies
"Those earnings are Bluetooth,  who is she talking too"
"This is no laughing matter. <br><br>Media should be asking how on earth can a puppet like this make it this far and more importantly who is actually running things.<br><br>I get the feeling that all mainstream media is now ""in on this theatre""."
Sky news you're maga ( moroons against great America)💙💙💙🔵
Trump 2024 ❤
We never see anything but scripted or pre planned questions in debates! She is a JOKE!!
"Reno, the Marxist Dems know that voting for Kamala is a vote for Obama. He’s the one running for prez"
Embarrassing clown 🤡 Kamala 😂
The question is how long have you been using AI….
As a Brit this is kind of absolutely none of my business- I love trump his ethos and America first - this is what evry nation should be doing staying out of eachorher business - but Harris is clearly a moron and a puppet your going from one delude idealist that lives in dreamland to another
Trump 2024
Trump 2024
Kamala is a clown 🤡 <br>Bla Bla. Bla …….. Holistically 😂 Holistically 😂<br>Holistically 😢<br>Holistically 😮
No words
Lies 😢
Don't the Taxpayers  pay enough Trump all the way
"Will this election please get over with? I don't think I can stand to look at this false face another minute. Moreover, this relentless and fake news coverage that shows that she's ahead is a national disgrace. She's a liar and a fake. He sister said that ""she'll say and do anything to get her way"". I hope FOX and SKY will find that tape and release it for all to see."
""" Lets put her in this next term"". She will create a bigger media buzz than Joe ever did! That will keep the citizens entertained while we can continue to reach or objectives to ultimately have complete control. ""All swampers in favor say aye"""
She embarrassed what the Biden crime family left as a country. How much money was she paid to let the Chinese spy balloons fly over our country? She is a drunk and a lazy idiot.
"This is sad. At this point we need Trump simply to feel safe. This dumb lady drunk on power will treat the oval office like the main set of a reality tv show, spitting nonsensical philosophy like your drunk uncle."
Liberal women are the reason our founding fathers did not give women the right to vote.
What is Sky News???  These people are not reasonable!  So sad. Wow!!
So full of it..   liair Harris
"😂😂😂 this election is simple, she is awful as a vice president and has had time to start working on things and she has done nothing so why in the hell would you want her as a president lol! She is a complete fool"
Heels up Harris
Gov. is not helping storm victims!!!! Yhats your job Mr. President. You gave FEMA S MONEY TO ILLEGALS! TRUMP IS IN!!!!!
Two things ive noticed in my 63 years. One is that the government will create a huge problem . Then they will have the sollution and solve that oroblem. Which comes with orders to follow for your own saftey. <br>The second one is to announce or create a huge dilemma that everyone focuses on while the dirty deeds are happening behind the scenes to pass a law ir enforce more regulations. Only after the supposed dilemma goes away that the dirty deeds have been done are then discovered and uts too late to do anything about it.
What a liar (the CNN anchor women)
"We need to stop calling them terrorists, it confuses the smooth brains. Call them what they are, Muslim religious fanatics. To be even more specific, Shia, Muslim fanatics. This deserves distinction because the Sunni States have been behaving this time around."
Our dreams and ambitions and aspirations are all about holistic inspirations
"All Americans need food and jobs and the people of the hurricane areas need help and to let citizens in to be able to deliver items that are needed, they don’t need government standing there saying people can’t go in to help when there’s nobody from the government is helping"
To even consider her as a candidate totally blows my mind! It trully makes me question my trust in the Government. It makes me wonder if ever the tables will turn back where the people have the piwer and absolutely the government does not. That is the constitution. The constitution clearly states any goverment acting in a tyrannical order must be removed by the citizens by whatever means possible.
When she talks about her policies she shakes her head side to side shes is telling us without telling us she is a fucking bag of shit liar.
Dont care for her
Her body language gives away when she is getting ready to answer with a lie
"sick of hearing ""dreams and aspirations"" and now ""holistic"" she is stuck in a loop....she has become a robot"
"After 4 years of Joke Biden, people should be eager to vote for change."
"In the area of body language there are certain behavior patterns that indicate wether the individual is being truthful or lying. While she is speaking her head is going from side to side saying no, no no."
"She did a terrible job the last four years. Why would she do ay better the next four years? Her and Biden were a, ""perfect,"" match.  She has early onset Alzheimer syndrome."
Notice how she speaks resembles someone? The body language... I wonder if that ear piece she always wears has Obama puppeteer on the other end...
Kamala is a very scary person. Pure evil & another WEF puppet .
She’s so hard to watch
She uses the word holistically when she hates & don't worship GOD. SHE is for satan...
"BS, nothing but BS, and lies upon lies. Nothing but holistic BS."
What a dullard.
"A monster, look at what see did the last years as vice president."
A stupid Kamaleon on the loose!
Why do I have a feeling Kamala was a regular guest at them Diddy parties
waving hands like witches wands
"wht's the message behind her ""man suits"" she wears in same exact masculine style but in different color pallet. Dictatorship subliminal, but obvious to the intelligent. Trump JD Vance only, for the sake of our lives and coutry"
"Kamala may not be smart judging her very limited vocabulary. Still she has more than 12 million illegals. So, she'll win!<br>The GOP is aslept!"
"She's too dumb to even know what ""holistically"" means. Habitual liar, as well."
She just has to be 'nice' the people like her. Sheep
I'm inspired  to tell  you  to shut the hell up Kamela.
You. Need. Resign. Kamala. You. Are. Lieing. Bitch. What. You. Did. At. Border. You. Should. Be. Jail. Life. An. No. Pension. You. Look. Good. Federal. Prison. She. Às. Smart. First. Grader
Dreams ambitions and aspirations. Non stop repeat
Exactly what policies has Kamala Harris created?? The only policy Kamala Harris announced was the one she literally stole from Trump.. What a pathetic embarrassment..
Dreams - Ambitions - ????
What Plan.’ Lying again Kamala.
Weird and stupid.  She doesn’t have black grandparents - her family in Jamaica had plantations and slaves.  FACT CHECK ME.
How anybody could vote for this woman for anything is unbelievable. I wouldn’t vote for her for dogcatcher.
"You grew up in Canada,  what do you know about american dreams"
"How the hell was she ever a prosecutor ?   Who did she prosecute, Bozo???"

She should revert to old tactics and lay on her back with legs in the air and hope for the best!
I think this shows very clear neither her or Biden are the ones who have been running the country.
I hate this cgannel
"Please check out Candace Owen's. You will be amazed qt what she has found out about Kamala and her claim to be black, which she is far from."
2.1 million views and 99.9% of us see a lunatic pathological lying hyena of a woman with a scary crazy laugh thats horrifically unqualified.<br><br>TRUMP 2024
it's bad when my brother and I work 60 hours a week at twenty one dollars an hour and still struggle our dreams are just hoping to keep a roof over our heads and afford bills and groceries
"We have hopes, we have dreams, we have 🌈""IMAAAGIMATION""🌈"
"Imagine being so braindead that you'd actually vote for this cackling communist pathalogical lying dumbass Hyena Harris.<br><br>She's a complete fraud, fake and would be an ecenomic vandal. <br><br>Vote early to stop election day rigging and vote in big groups while wearing red."
If she wins we know for a fact out voting system is rigged
She can’t answer questions directly. She cannot be president
I'm so confused as to why this is a serious conversation being had in the US. It's so obvious how clueless this woman is yet I keep hearing people jeer her on like a bard in Skyrim.
She is a  jokeand her supporters are the same.before the clowns start.i dont follow Republicans or democrats.both are a joke and only care about themselves not the people's
She is stupid
What the hell did she just try to tell us??????
"I would just LOVE to watch & listen to the media Democrat Socialists if Trump wins in a landslide, both in the Electoral College AND the popular vote."
HOLISTICALLY IS A GREAT WORD...BACK OFF BITCHES
She's lie's about everything and blames it' on Trump.Her and Biden fucked up America.everybody no's that.there going to try to rig it again.and the Kennedy's voters goes to Donald trump.
"her and walz ""dumb and dumber"""
The American ppl are not Willie Brown. Don’t talk to us like we are some “JOHN” and your making your sale
"Y mira con quien se codea la kamala?? Con la Cabra de Opra ,??? Pura basura la rodea!!!"
Kamala cant even think on her feet no backbone.
Trump & Vance 2024 🙏<br>Thank you Sky News Australia 💖
Dumbest presidential candidate EVER!
Kamala is the anti christ….
She has no clue about finance  she talks  so much B S. Lies to cover their bad  management
The survival of Western Civilization lies in the fickle hands of women voters!
Im inspired  to vote  for  president  Trump  not simpieton kamula  🎉
She don't care about this country.
She don't care about this country.
🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
Why would anybody  vote  for  lying  kamala  ?
"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fire"">#Fire</a>-kamala"
"Biden/Harris has raided FEMA to support illegal aliens, now FEMA is broke! Your should check out her response to the hrricane damage in the southeast"
She’s dangerous
Truly clueless
"Kamala,  really??? Hard working isnt a trait of the black community. Two parent family isnt a trait of the black comunity. Raising your kids to be tax paying contributing members of society is not a trait of the black community.<br>What are traits of the current black comunity are criminal activity, laziness, no ambition, aspirations, and joy!!! Ha, sound familiar. Kamala, get out of bed on time, read your briefs, address your advisors, listen and learn!!!  You want to be black, then you are a microcosm of that by your own actions of lies and excuses!"
Holistic Cow
It's evident she knows positively nothing about anything!<br>..
"TYPICAL DEMOCRAT, LIE AND DENY"
"As a 61-year-old woman, I've seen a lot go on in this country. I would love to see a woman in office, but this woman is not the woman to put there. She lies she can't even get a sentence out without using word salads. She has no idea what's going on. She opened the border and flooded our country with illegal immigrants who are criminals who are killing our people. She's allowed more fentanyl into this country than anybody else.  Which is also killing our people. She's just not the right woman for this job. She wasn't the right woman to be Vice President. Let alone President and unfortunately, because our President is in continent right now and has absolutely no brain. Left his wife and this woman. Kamala are running our country. It's wake up America, vote Trump."
Not true you lame😅
"A lying politician, that's why Trump the business man got my vote"
There was a girl that I knew that tried to impress me by learning a new word every day.  But it only upset me more. I disliked here even more. She was once my best. But vastly grew apart.
She sounds like a teenage beauty pageant contestant
My god isnt the thick
"All I ask, is that if Kamala gets voted in, please, world, please, don't act like all Americans voted for her.  Be kind to those of us who voted against her, please. 🥺"
I hate the words holistic and aspirations.
"Dreams like religion are falicys, delusions or just that dreams. You cannot make them real no matter how much you want, try, pray. The American dream was a phrase in a book that more applied to liberty freedom opportunity to a point. But has been twisted to mean money, cars, homes status. But again it's a fictional phelosophy and a phelosophy depends on understanding, customs, religion, social status upbringing and so on. It's fluid not rigid and based on interpretation.. People need to live in reality these things are destroying humanity. Not that that's a bad thing. All perspectives"
I am supporting TRUMP HOLISTICALLY!!!😂
"D.TRUMP will be our next president AMERICA, Thank God!!!!!!!!!"
"As an Aussie, I feel for my American friends with this embarrassment of a candidate. She’s bat shit crazy 🤪 Best of luck guys 🙄❤️"
She has no answer. Period!
My closed captioning must be controlled by those 'racist' right wingers. It never did get her name correct!
She’s not saying anything wrong
Skynews for the WIN!
"Kamala belongs in the junkyard...disgusting persona , and two faced low moral decadent witch."
She is basically the president NOW and ain't doing shit and that is what she will do if elected.
Aren't we all ready to turn the page with Kamala??......   😒🤣
"stephanie, please undie your hair color, it makes you look older."
She is done she is full of crap incredibly bad policies Trump landslide
"The economy was beginning to boom during DJT's term, and things had begun to stabilize."
"""Holistically"" speaking, I am holistically underwhelmed by her holistic word-salads."
She never got one delegate …. She fell into it !
Never underestimate a democrat’s ability to lie.
Holistic she's holistically involved she's holistically involved in housing holistically taking her holistic lifestyle
Lies lies and lies. She lies.
I’m An American for my entire life but I’d leave in a heartbeat because I don’t have to put up with this hypocrisy and blatant lies and propaganda against white peoples
"I think North Carolina will be for Trump, especially after the massive failure from the gov to assist the people from the historic floods.  FEMA is confiscating goods surrounding people have sent to them and threatening arrests if anyone tries to help rescue. That’s not who we are in the Appalachian Mountains."
Still better than voting for a felon! <br>Trump's a douchebag idiot lying piece of sh*t. Can't wait for him to go to prison.
Faken UN BEE LEIV ABLE
"All those suffering from the Horrendous, hurricane need more than Dreams, ambitions, goals, aspirations and holistically to get their lives back on track <br>Biden/Harris should be ashamed of how these people have been treated ,,they are Americans but immigrants are looked after better , FEMA has run out of money due to immigration nothing left for the hurting people of the hurricane,,,,remember this and vote trump/Vance ❤❤❤"
People's I.Q's drop listening to this inarticulate & incoherent Kamel Toe speak.
She basically said you’ll do as she wants and it doesn’t matter if you want it
Shes failed upwards so much that she actually thinks she deserves to fail upwards again…
Time to DIVORCE Kamala and keep her out of the White House 😊😊
"Inspire us, by inspiring us and we continue to inspire us HOW1"
She wears the same clothes. Same earings everytime.
"“ If you’re hard working and have dreams and aspirations, you’re in my plan”. Thats terrifying. Shes coming for you!"
I have never seen a person talk so much and say absolutely so little of any value
Workd leaders will PASS HER AROUND like all sharpton did when she was his call girl back in the day al was a drug dealer and PIMP!!!
"Headboard harris is an ""ADDICT ""ALCOHOL AND DRUGS FOR DECADES NOW.WE DONT WANT YET ANOTHER ""ADDICT ""IN POWER"
Time for voter fraud to save the day!
"If she ran for mayor of Madison Wisconsin, she'd win. These brain dead morons just love her."
"the deep state needs a puppet ,what a git"
I dreamed your gone!
Opera need to be investigated
...love the background for the interview...someone's little workshop...is that made to code ?...
"...I think she caught it from Joey...she is suffering from a severe case of ""BRAIN FARTS""...<br>   and if you are smart enough to notice what she has done for the border...it is nothing short of TREASON !!!<br>   ...ILLEGAL (look it up) aliens have received housing, funding, and more benefits then American citizens...<br>   Please look up the definition of the word TREASON !, and open your eyes to what a traitor she and the<br>   administration are...they're not in it for U.S. ..."
"No way in hell would I vote for Kruelmala Harris and yes , yes I would only vote for Trump ♥️ Trump 💯"
The nanny with the broom from Tom and Jerry would be better than KH
"MSNBC is a wholly Democratic Party whitewash facility, if this bimbo suffers under their soft touch, she’s no match for even a 17 year old political debater, let alone seasoned veterans."
She cannot become president of the United States...ever!
"This is the game; <br>get her polling figures up using fake polls, then flood the ballot boxes with fake ballots and votes from illegal migrants....prevent all independent or even bipartisan scrutiny of the count and then steal another election....to be honest neither of them really represent the will of the people. Who wants  neverending wars ?"
Kamala's most important political advisor is her dental hygienist !
Happy ones like uppers
She is on drugs
Don't just look at Harris look at the 2nd Lady Walz turning pages and how she explained it. These DEMORATS NEED MENTAL HEALTH APPOINTMENTS.
"If she wins, WE ARE ALL FUCKED"
Never mind I saw her wedding ring it just doesn't have a rock on his very flat😂
And wait a minute I thought she was married where's her wedding ring
I think we all know who's gonna be president 😮‍💨
She wants you to work hard so you can pay for her illegals.
We are convinced that she is a Liar!
"I am not from USA, but hell - then you look at Roosevelt and practically every president until 80-ies, and then you look at ""this""...strange feeling"
The poll is not 🚫 the people
RITA WE LOVE YOU  YOU CAN SEE HOW CORRUPT THE DEMOCRAT PARTY ARE SO CAN I AND KARMILA HARRIS FLEW OVER THE COOKOOS NEST SHE IS A GOOD ACTRESS WITH FAKE CHARM AND VERY CRUEL SHE SHOULD BE IMPEACHED  FOR FLYING MORE ILEGAL IMAGRANTS IN BY BIG JUMBO JETS  AND BLOOD ON HER HANDS FOR DEATHS AND 325 MISSING CHILDREN DONALD TRUMP IS INNOCENT OF THOSE COURT CHARGES  SHE WAS BEHIND THEM TO GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY WAKE UP AMERICA  VOTE TRUMP VANCE ❤❤❤

She needs to word salad a little better..give it some ranch and croutons Already. She's Ignorant
Let me guess Trump paid you. Trump no better. Its a shame that America can't find a good Presidential candidate
"Firstly this woman on the news panel SHOUTS TOO MUCH. Now about Kamala, I would think she couldn't run for a bus let alone a presidency. God help the USA if this idiotic woman gets in  she's a danger because she pretends to know about government and will cause many troubles for their country. She talks but says absolutely  NOTHING except B.S. ."
How could she ever have an interview with Putin . She was once in Poland . She laughs all the time through her stupid attempt to deliver a speech .
Get your. Poses out of tRUMPS RUMP!!!
"Cannot listen to this nasa lvoice .  ,Well one can hear how she is thinking ."
"She talks nonsense, just like Biden, but he had dementia, what's her excuse.<br>Thick as a plank."
I'm not sure what she's saying
Two choices hmmmm I’m getting 2016 flashbacks. My answer will be the same as it was back then. I’m for Trump so world war 3 doesn’t happen
Lie lie lie
Dumb woman

The USA is going down thanks to biden n this nit wit! My heart goes out to the hurricane victims. Bad enough with the help of fema but no fema what is going to happen?😢
Not to sure if NC will be voting blue cause no government are helping the western part of the state after Helene. People are actually seeing that. They are reporting that elon musk has given them at least star link to communicate with the outside world
the McDonald's and the fake grandmother and listening to Tupac in 88 its all a lie
Ka’Mammy Harris is a <b>LIAR</b>
"Oh wow, you should be discucted Australian media. Wow, let's let Trump run the free world😅  You bunch of grubs😢"
"Shut up Kamala you’re giving SALAD a bad name, when she opens her mouth she sprouts VERBAL VOMIT 😳"
"If Kamala was slapped each time she lied, her nose wold be on her left ear."

This brings new meaning to being drop dead dumb!!!
Apparently Willy isn’t the only one with a hand in her
"One question, isn't there an iq test and minimum iq standard to become President? I am Dutch and see Kamala Harris, for me her iq is like that of a 12 y.o. kid."
"Harris is  a train wreck vote Trump and  Vance period, save America!"
Sad
She's flairing those nostrils
How in the H3LL could anyone with a brain cell vote for this DUNCE!
Fake Republican shit.....go ahead vote for the felon
"Democrats insist on insulting the Voter. We have a memory birtch, and your the birtch we remember."
BOTH THESE 2 IDIOTS ARE ON A SCRIPT. HARRIS IS STUPID AND THE INTERVIEWER  HATES TRUMP AND ANYTHING GOES TO MAKE HARRIS LOOK GOID. WHICH FAILS MISERABLY
I sware she needs to stay out of Hunter Bidens cocaine.
Willie Brown's #2 ho'. She wasn't even his #1 ho'.

Camel is useless Worthless Brain dead garbage
America - what the hell is wrong with you? How can you even contemplate supporting a nomination as President of the United States such as this ridiculous woman?
"Camel-face Harris wasn't anywhere near ""raveled"" in the first place, lol. She's got more than a few screws loose, the he/she creature. She makes Ped0 Joe look like a Mensa candidate."
TRUMP 2024 🇺🇲❤️🇺🇲❤️<br>SHE'S AN IDIOT!!!
"Holistic is not anything that im looking for in a president. She may talk ""better"" than Joe, but she sure as hell doesnt say anything smarter or  meaningful."
Word salad. 😂😅
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤LOVE USA 🇺🇸 ❤ PRESIDENT TRUMP ❤ 💙 💜 ♥ 🙌 💕 ❤ 💙 💜 ♥ 🙌 💕 ❤ 💙 💜 ♥ 🙌 💕 ❤ ❤ 💙 💜 ♥ ❤ 💙 💜 ♥ 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
She's an idiot
Population control is what Kamala is all about
Unraveling? This woman has been unraveled. She took over 1B dollars in FEMA funds and helped the migrant relief with it. Now FEMA is stating they don’t have enough funds to make it through hurricane season. Is anyone going to help NC right now. Those poor people paid into their taxes and get nothing back when disaster hits. And it’s Disney Land for all migrants. This is F**cked up!
I would love to know why her running mate's whole family is against him?
TRUMP 2024🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲👍👏🙏❤️❤️❤️
"Typical Sky News style...(cringe) like some critique of a footy match. Nothing intelligent here. Like a mob of crows tearing the eyes and entrails out of their victim. How about some comparison with Trump who is the most deceitful, evil and moronic presidential candidate ever. Think forward to how the state of the world and life in America will be 6 months after the election.... Idiots !!!"
I'm getting really goddamn tired of this stop sending my money overseas I don't see any of those other countries sending money over here stop sending my money everywhere else take care of United States first and foremost
She is holistically stupid 😂
She’s a drunk
Jow you like her face humgaryfor s🤐
BAISED NETWORK
Fox News must interview her father.
Trump 2024
We have three choices the doctor Cornel West for president of the United States in 2024 why y'all neglected to talk about Dr Cornel West y'all some ignorant ass people!
"Holistically speaking,  not a single intelligent neuron in your brain,  you are unfit  and unqualified as VP, that says all."
Kamala’s Proof-Positive that an Intracranial 100% Pure VACUUM CAN EXIST Outside a Laboratory Situation..!!!🇺🇸
Trump as inspired me to vote for Harris…. 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
She'd sell out anyone with a lie
THANK YOU FOR THESE EYE OPENING FAILURES OF KAMALA HARRIS!!  SHE IS A DESASTER FOR AMERICA!!!
She's talking out of her a$$.
Sky news making anti coporate tax propaganda do be a thing tho :D
She's spends a lot of time on word salads...nothing meaningful or substantial.
Anybody remember the tabloids?
She is a airhead
I don't like the background music. Otherwise I love Sky.
"Is so sad that people  care only about the color, gender or party and no care about brain.😢"
shut up look in 2016 thru trump look at the last 4 yrs get your head of the sand
What would Kamala know about work …She has failed in every job she ever had …the only thing she’s mastered is lying ‼️Hopefully Americans will wake-up in time to vote for Mr Trump 💯‼️🇺🇸Save our Republic 🇺🇸
😮 what is the holistic economy plan?
"Scamala is a pathological liar !!  Just believe the opposite of what she, msm, the view and all far left say!!!"
Only a foolish person who lacks ANY intelligence would vote for Kamela and the Democrats...
I think she’s holistically high as $hit! 😂
I’m so sick pig hearing her voice 😡 well and her stupidity
Thank God Great America does not respect habitual liars.<br>Tell those critics to look after their country wherein numerous countries especially Jamaica (Kamala's father is Jamaican) who have plans to make Jamaica independent of UK.<br>Look at precisely what is going on there with those leeches.
Wtf how is this on the news? Holistic is a word. A simple google and Rita would have learned that 😂
"Corporate taxes hurt local businesses, people forget that whether they have 2 employees or 2 million its a corporation, and they all get taxed at a flat rate before Trump, that was 35% Trump lowered that to be 25%. Should also say corporate taxes have 0 effect on extremely wealthy people all it does is drive up costs you dumb twit"
Reminds me of Frank Burns from MASH - It’s nice to be nice to the nice 😂😂😂
Big big liar. Typical of what we call “itik” people
Please select a person who speaks clearly and smoothly and not a liar.<br>All know Trump is also a habitual liar.<br>Why would anyone constantly interview with the absolute enemy?
And Child care is child care 😂 Australia has the worst justice system and should be more concerned abort that than our election. 😂
Sky News is obnoxious
Booba😅
The left is run by incompetent people 😮
A duh😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
It is bad when CNN is calling out a democrat for being a liar😂
If She wins it will ge a testimony for Americans becoming really stupid. Too stupid to be considered as the superpower of the world..
I smell bull💩😂 CHUMP is losing again. 🗳💙
MAGA!
"The people who want to vote for Kamala Harris have every right to do so if they want to, I think they should find a toxic waste dump and all go there and live quite happily"
Let’s talk about her always wearing the SAME earrings. Let’s reveal if they are earphones and being fed what to say.
LIES LIES LIES!!!!
Why is Australia obsessed with American Politics? Go pet a kangaroo
How selfish Camila should be to participate in election👎👎👎
IM ABSOLUTELY VOTING FOR TRUMP WITHOUT QUESTION ⁉️
Scary lack of depth.
All of her stupid answers are you all you are going to get.  What psyche did she escape from?
I'm inspired to be inspired in the future to be inspired to inspire others to inspire me.
"Absolutely, Trump is a better choice for the economy."
"When you listen to her, don’t you feel like inserting  a bullet Manually?!<br>The Biggest Loon In History 😢"
IF YOU WANT TO SURVIVE DON'T VOTE FOR THIS STUPID BTCH HARRIS
I will suck a dick for a vote
Tired of this one-sided channel. No class. She could still win....
CERTIFIED NUTCASE= KAMALA KINTE
Where our tax money goes 😂😂😂😂😂😊
Another democrat / communist. Empty brain
West of time 😢😢😢😢
She just stupid 😢😢😢😢😢
Rise taxes wow
Just wait you think cereal 5 dollors it will be 10
Note how when Trump was in office the cost of living didn't change? It didn't go down but it didn't go up either.  She's just trying to weaponize that he was born into wealth to win more votes.
The only people I've met that praise her have 0 clue how anything works. <br>They think day 1 she'll legalize marijuana on a federal level and make abortion legal on a federal level. <br>Somehow these people think that everyone that didn't vote democrat is intentionally out to get them.
"No plan, no idea, clueless, kaMULA  <br>Is still very burden by what has been,"
"Tiered, of this administration! Democrats  destroyed our country .,,Trump 2O24"
Sorry but ain’t she a Marxist
I like Kamala. Not a criminal like Trump.
Kamala: darn where s obama?? !!
Please pronounce her name correctly.
Leave her along people are so bias against her cuz of her race
Unraveling she’s been a damn loser from the beginning
Do you have a video of Harris scoffing at FEMA Meeting when questioned about the Hurricane tragedy?  I can’t remember where I heard it but did she make a comment saying the red states were effected by the hurricane we’re mostly red which will effect Trumps votes?  She was boasting.  I don’t recall the exact words but the jest of it.  I wish I would have saved it when I saw it.  It enraged me at the time.  She is evil.  Watch  Candace Owens investigation on Harris’s book against the facts regarding her family. It’s in 4-5 video’s There are a lot of holes in the truth regarding her parents and family providing that she is lying about being black roots.
Lock up Kamala with Joe the joke
"If Trump wins, it won't be because his supporters outnumbered Kamala's supporters, it'll be because Kamala is so utterly dull-witted and incompetent that not even her supporters wanted to vote for her. Like srsly, even that goofy AI generated Kamala campaign ad sounded more coherent and confident than the real Kamala. <br><br>Edit: I just realized Kamala is pretty much George Bush 2.0 from how many ""Bushisms"" she's been saying... Should we rebrand them to Kamalisms or Harrisms now?"
"You can see in her eyes that she's ins a dream. Man ,it gives me chills guys 😮"
So she can tax you be hard woʻrkers
She's fake
This 😂 is a joke
TRUMPS IDIOCY IS UNPARALLELED.
Holistic BULLSHIT.
TALK ABOUT BIASED REPORTING!!
WTF 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
"Wow, even CNN fact checked her...When CNN goes against its favorite party, you know Harris is an issue... a bad word salad, with a side of lies!"
All lies KAMALA😴
TRUMP 🇺🇲VANCE🇺🇲🙏🏻🌹🙏🇺🇸
Somebody should choke on that much word salad! Puke! 🤮
"K, you little sky net muskrat looking b. Stick to your own country. No one cares about your opinions in the US."
One choice....I am voting for President Trump!! I do not believe anything ABC or NBC says or any of their lying polls!!
By the way she didn't grow up middle class.... Candace has facts. Her family had servants.
Go watch Candace. Kammy lied in her book about her family. The picture with her grandmother is fake because her grandmother died before she was born.
😂❤
"She needs to be fully scripted at all times, she cannot field questions that were not pre approved for her to answer."
Kamal is a marxist liar!
She is totally unqualified to be in politics period.
GO AND BUY A TWO DOLLAR BILL FROM TRAMP trump FOR $ 20.00  RETARDED DEGENERATE maga MONKEY'S.
LMFAO 😂😂😂
"Its odd that the Democrats want a women as prisdent when they still know what a women 😳 is . <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k90LSk70ckU&t=81"">1:21</a> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k90LSk70ckU&t=97"">1:37</a>"
SHE'S A FREAKING JOKE 🤣🤣🤣
She has a talent for saying so much without saying anything at all.
The whole world LAUGHS at Cameltoes word salads?

Kamala Holistically kiss my Keester.

She’s such a liar!
She’s a total moron. Period

THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS LIES MAGA WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE !   GO KAMALA  ! 🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🩵🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲😊
She is din-don🔔🔔🔔
It is really sad to see the democrats couldn't come up with better candidate
No we the best till the virus
Bitch lied
Dumb as a 🧰 😂
Oh how intellectually superior you guys think to be but you call Hamas terrorists. Replication of western propaganda.What about critical thinking
"After listening to the kids in college, none of them have a brain big enough to vote. Cum On man, be real. Even after they learn that she lies about almost everything they still say, Oh yeah, I'm still not voting for Trump."
Idiot if anybody wants 4 more of this Must be an Idiot as Well !
"Shaking her head no as she is speaking is because she is fighting with her own brain to say something that is not in it. In other words, she is lying to her herself into the world. It’s very evident to see from her facial expression, her eye movement, and her body language. She’s a fake."
Idiot!!!!!!!!!!!
She is such a liar!
"Who doesn't think Kamala was going to say we (we, not her) will all have to pay more taxes? She caught herself in time, but we know what was coming."
Journo is the problem... If you vote for Kamala Harris... You are the problem! What a freaking joke she is!
I refuse to watch ANYTHING screaming Storer discusses.  😮😮😮😮
she talks and talks and doesnt really say anything
Harris the natural liar!
Does Storer have a hearing problem?
"What a joke. All she does is blame Trump for everything. Not smart enough to run this country. The media will protect her. If you trust poll numbers from the media, your an idiot."
Yes Kamala. We do have dreams and aspirations. What we need is money to fund those dreams and aspirations.
Is it not obvious. Have you not figured out yet the media is mostly owned by the left and George Soros in America. No he didn't sweet heart. You guys screwed up the country. All lies Kamala!
"Seems like every questions is "" Kamala, how do you deal with being so great?"" and every answer is :  (kackle) ""Well you know, I was born. And as I grew older, I grew larger in my middle class (not) household, unburdened by what has been"". (kay)"
Duhh
So full of crap. If you don't like trump vote for the libertarian candidate. At least he's not a complete doofus and liar. Worthless except to continue to kill Americans and give our country away!
"do you viewers not understand that Kamala Harris is the only person with a background to be president, Lawyer, AG Cali, Senator, and vice president for last four years.. Name Trumps background??"
I think the phrase ‘word salad’ entails more discernible distinct colours and shapes than what Kamala serves up.<br><br>She’s more your word meatloaf kinda of operator.<br><br>You don’t make friends with salad.
What a load of shit FOX NEWS --FOX Not News
Kamala definitely ain’t no Hola Back girl. She comes more with that ‘off brand’ wafflin’ nonsense flo.
TRUMP 🇺🇲❤🇺🇲 MAGA!!!!
I think she'll be elected. ☹
Hahaha 😝
"As I recall, Trump had the economy at its strongest since Obama's attempt to destroy America."
"A certain gender doesn't make anybody better. Male or female, integrity, honesty and real experience counts. Trump might've made some errors, fumbled horribly but wants the best for the people, and that's what counts, the people, not the past. Progression is having something to bring to the table. Trump has always said, don't let your enemies know too much, or we'll be left with too little again. Keep your mouth shut, like Trump says, and just do it when the time comes to follow through for your country. Don't hide in the basement. Or be hungover some place, speaking in word salad code..🎩😡👎"
Kamala is the biggest ‘Box Car Willie’ President-in-waiting of all time.<br><br>Her credibility in the squared circle makes Joe Biden look like Oscar De La Hoya.<br><br>…which is saying something
Idiot
Joking laughing on oprah after that parent was crying was heartless
Don’t listen to this
I think it’s unreasonable to claim that Kamala has ‘unraveled’….there’s never been any evidence she was ‘ravelled’ to begin with.
"Kamala quality is🖕, ship this fool out to a sh*thole country for good."
We did’t pay $4.00 for a docen of eggs when Trump was a president.
Y'all must be trump crash dummies 😅
That  B-I-M-B-O is going to be POTUS....   GOD HELP US...
Dumbest human I ever hears speak above 2
Well somebody must've edited this while asleep
Ugh….such vomit!
"Then you guys must be extremely concerned about Trump and his constant nonsensical word salads.  I've actually never heard her speak nonsensically so are these just snippets you've put together to sound bad?  Remember, Trump inherited a great economy and destroyed us is about 3 1/2 years.  The whole country was shut down and we've been paying for his poor decisions ever since!  Where have you people been hiding or are you just putting out mixed lies and messages to support your own agenda?"
Liar false claim loser had fact check
It’s just so sad that it’s Trump rage and not what is best for the country!!!
Sounds like Harris is just trying to be a life coach
Christians support Harris...like it or not.
Just VOTE Trump/Vance!!!!! Let’s take America back please!!!!!!!❤❤❤
Not true
"WORTH THE LONG READ...<br>THIS IS WHO KAMALA HARRIS REALLY IS!<br><br>The History of Kamala Harris<br>by Geoffrey B. Higginbotham <br>Major General, USMC (Ret.)<br>  <br>For your knowledge and interest about the Biden Vice President, Kamala Harris.  Here is a timely editorial that exposes the hidden background of Kamala Harris from the Combat Veterans for Congress Political Action Committee that is posted here with permission of the author. CVFC PAC supports the election of US military combat veterans to the US Senate and House of Representatives. The editorial begins: <br><br>Kamala Harris' father was an avowed Marxist professor in the Economics Department at Stanford University in Palo Alto, CA. Both of Harris' parents were active in the Berkeley based Afro-American Association; Fidel Castro and Che Guevara were the heroes of the Afro-American Association. <br><br>The group's leader, Donald Warden (aka Khalid al-Mansour), mentored two young Afro-American Association members, Huey Newton and Bobby Seale; they created the Maoist inspired Black Panther Party which gained strong support from Communist China; the Black Panther Party served as the model for creation of the Black Lives Matter Marxist organization Khalid al-Mansour subsequently went on to arrange financing and facilitated for Barack Hussein Obama to be accepted as a student to matriculate at Harvard Law School. <br><br>Following her graduation from college, Harris returned to California and subsequently became the mistress of the 60-year-old married Speaker of the California Assembly, Willie Brown, Jr. Brown's political campaigns were supported and funded by Dr. Carlton Goodlett, the owner of The Sun Reporter and several other pro-Communist newspapers. <br><br>Brown was elected as Mayor of San Francisco, and strongly endorsed Harris' Marxist political philosophy; he guided Harris' political rise in California politics, leading to her election as California's Attorney General. Willie Brown, Jr. was a well-known long-time Communist sympathizer. Willie Brown, Jr. was initially elected to public office with the substantial help of the Communist Party USA. <br><br>Today, Willie Brown is widely regarded as one of the Chinese Communist Party's best friends in the San Francisco Bay Area. <br><br>While serving as San Francisco District Attorney, Kamala Harris mentored a young San Francisco Radical Maoist activist, Lateefah Simon, who was a member of the STORM Revolutionary Movement; Simon currently chairs the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Board. Simon has always been close friends with the founder of Black Lives Matter Marxist Domestic Terrorists, Alicia Garza, as well as STORM member and avowed Communist, Van Jones. Harris has been openly and aggressively supporting Black Lives Matter Marxists; Kamala Harris is still closely associated with Maoist Lateefah Simon and Marxist Alicia Garza. <br><br>Kamala Harris's sister Maya Harris was a student activist at Stanford University. She was a closely associated with Steve Phillips, one of the leading Marxist-Leninists on campus and a long-time affiliate with the League of Revolutionary Struggle, a pro-Chinese Communist group. <br><br>Phillips came out of the Left, and in college he studied Marx, Mao, and Lenin, and maintained close associations with fellow Communists. Phillips married into the multibillion-dollar Sandler family of the Golden West Savings and Loan fortune. He funded many leftist political campaigns, and voter registration drives in the Southern and South Western states in order to help his friend, Barack Hussein Obama, defeat Hillary Clinton. Phillips has been a major financial sponsor for Kamala Harris's political campaigns for various California elective offices plus Cory Booker, Andrew Gillum, Stacey Abrams to name a few. <br><br>Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff works for the law firm DLA Piper, which ""boasts nearly 30 years of experience in Communist China with over 140 lawyers dedicated to its 'Communist China investment Services' branch. He was just appointed Professor at Yale to school future lawyers in the fine points of Communism.<br>When she was elected to the US Senate, Kamala Harris appointed a Pro-Communist Senate Chief of Staff, Karine Jean-Pierre. Jean-Pierre was active with the New York-based Haiti Support Network. The organization worked closely with the pro-Communist China/Communist North Korea Workers World Party and supported Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the far-left Communist former president of Haiti and the radical Lavalas movement. <br><br>Fortunately for Harris, but potentially disastrous for the Republic, elected office holders are not subject to the security clearance process. If the FBI did a Background Investigation on Kamala Harris, she never would have passed, because of her 40-year close ties with Marxists, Communists, Maoists, and Communist China. Harris would never have been approved for acceptance to any of the 5 Military Service Academies, been appointed to a US Government Sub-Cabinet position, or would have been approved to fill a sensitive position for a high security defense contractor. Yet, since Joe Biden was elected, Harris could be a heartbeat away from being President. <br><br>The US constitutional Republic is being threatened by the People's Republic of Communist China (PPC) externally, and by their very active espionage operations within the United States. The People's Republic of Communist China (PPC), with 1.4 billion people, is governed by the 90 million member Chinese Communist Party (CCP), that has been working with Russia to destroy the US Constitutional Republic for over 70 years. <br><br>If the American voters read the background information (in Trevor Loudon's article) on Kamala Harris, they would never support her election as Vice President of the United States. Joe Biden is suffering from the early onset of dementia and will continue to decline in cerebral awareness; he will never be able to fill out a four-year term of office.<br>Since Biden was elected, the Socialists, Marxists, and Communist who control Kamala Harris, are planning to enact provisions of the 25th Amendment, in order to remove Joe Biden from office, so Harris can become the first Communist President of the United States. <br><br>Since Biden was elected, because Biden would not be up to it, Kamala Harris would lead the effort to appoint very dangerous anti-American Leftist, Communist, Socialists, and Marxists to fill highly sensitive positions in the Washington Deep State Bureaucracy. She would fill all appointive positions in the US Intelligence Agencies, in the Department of Homeland Security, in the Department of Defense, in The Justice Department, the Department of State, the FBI, the CIA, most cabinet positions, the National Security Council, and in the White House Staff. <br><br>American voters must alert their fellow Americans that Kamala Harris is a very serious National Security threat to the very survival of the US Constitutional Republic; she has been a fellow traveler of Marxists, Communists, Maoists, Socialists, Progressives, and Chinese Communists for over 35 years.<br>President Trump had much more background information on Kamala Harris than we presented here, and he was correct, when he accused Kamala Harris of being a Communist subverter. <br><br>Geoffrey B. Higginbotham <br>Major General, USMC (Ret.)"
look up her videos with the Mayor back in the day... you will see how she got to capitol hill.
She is a frigging idiot !! <br>TRUMP 2024
Youd think the people of a state supporting Kammy would be too embarrassed to announce it publicly
Cumala is a  LAD
She and biden should be in prison...they are criminals!!!
"Kamala only cares about Kamala. She lives in an ivory tower. She’s not gonna help the people in North Carolina because they’re probably not gonna even be able to vote because there’s no electricity no power and it’s probably the votes would go to Trump and she doesn’t want that so she’s not gonna help them. She could sell her money out of her pocket too. This whole thing doesn’t affect her personally and it’s all about Kamala and the left-wing agenda! She doesn’t give a rats ass about the Americans. She only cares about the immigrants that stay in these palatial hotels while literary is out on the street sleeping. It’s so backwards so crazy. Reminds me of the movie China cry. She’s a damn dictator she’s the one that’s a threat to democracy, and we all know it. The American people know it!"
Is she still transporting  her fans state to state
"Shame on the U.S MARINES attached to the white house detail, I would take a DISHONORABLE DISCHARGE before showing any Respect to the TRUE DOES ENEMY!!! SHAME ON YOU WHITE HOUSE MARINES!!! DISGRACE!!"
I must holistically say she is a holistically stupid A-Holistic…
"Fact checked, ty."
"GOD ALMIGHTY, HELP US if this thing wins!!!"

Another puppet for the cabal
This just shows how bad politics is in the USA
"Is this the best they can come up with ,bla bla bla bla if she wins “rigged” the west is in serious trouble ,more lies"
It’s a female Biden
What an idiot
"Deep state better start running, guamtomino is putting the sheets on.....😅"
She is pathetic
Go back into your play pen what a there is no words for this whatever it is 🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉🙉
"Kamala Harris does not put herself in front of the media, her handlers tell her to stay away from the media and they work around that. The Democratic Party kept her undercover for two years because she was an embarrassment. Now she’s like the holy savior. The Democratic Party is desperate and fractured. And if people vote for her because of her color or her gender are losers to begin with.<br>We are at the brink of a Middle East war and the current  administration has done nothing to even come close to fixing it. <br>Just vote with your brains and not your ignorance."
Keep fighting Trump 🎉
Holistically  does she  know  what  that mean  rambling Bull _ _ _  _
Holistically stupid how's her grass these days is it better than her neighbors

Trump."
"They only voting for her because they hate Trump,really bad way to vote. Trump has policy's Kamala has excuses and  babbles about nonsense."
She is a idiot  😂
Ruhl is absolutely  right.<br>Kamala is NOT running for perfect.<br>She's  running for PRESIDENT.
"Yes she has dreams only for the illegal border crossers, a bit like prim minster Albanese."
Mark is angry. I would never vote for anyone sngry . Again   Dems are 😂Angry peeps!!!!😅
Thank you Skynews
Damn near worse than Biden 😂 she don’t know wtf to say
Finally somebody who is being honest instead of sucking up to a super suspect puppet candidate who doesn’t even seem sure of herself
Corporations don't pay taxes WE DO!!!! TALK KAMALA.... WHATS YOUR PLAN???? AND FOR THAT REASON SHE WILL NOT GET MY VOTE
"Kamala Harris doesn't know any about being a president, she also lies about every single thing, always blaming Trump when gas prices and everything else was a lot cheaper and there was no war.  She hates America and the American people, she is a dictator and only helps the terrorists organization,  her goal is to destroy America, she worships Satan,  all her plans are going to create disaster after disaster,  is the FBI, CIA, DOJ,  HOMELAND SECURITY, BORDER PATROL, etc are these people betraying America and the Americans people on a deals that is  nothing but lies, words of a advice, don't listen to those who worship Satan, all lies to set you up.  Kamala Harris,  your children have NO future, she wants to change everything  that is a sin against God.  🙏 to God, the evilness has spread like a virus."
Such ignorance upon us.
Lie isiot
KAMALA TRYING HARD NOT TO LAUGH AT HER ON BS

I can’t wait for all the MAGAtards to leave the country after she wins. I’ll grab my popcorn
"Harris is so far out there, she's past Voyager 1"

"06:00 pm Oregon, USA...<br>I am a proud and true Republican! <br>She is an embarrassment to our country!<br>Pray for our country!"
Why is she shaking her head 'no' through the entire answer?
"When she brings up her hands,  she is very nervous, but when she brings up her hands & moves them around that way, it looks like she's tossing salad words hoping they'll form a sentence."
"Dog shit is better than Trump. But her’s a woman with a Doctorate in Jurisprudence, has decades of experience in the political sphere. Anyone voting for Trump is a fool"
Kamala what a disgrace
"How can the polls in swing states be tied and she’s even ahead in some?? Answer: Media Lies!!! She stopped herself from saying of course I’m raising taxes on the middle class, where else am I’m going to get the $ from??"
Bull shit on Sky as usual.
Train wreck. This is what George Soros can buy
Another Harris. fairy tale with hand gestures too!

I will not be spending one more penny on any famous people products..YES Republican celebs too. They will not take a stand & they've seemingly forgotten they were once like us. Struggling & at the MERCY of our law makers. Vote Trump if you really care about your country, this isn't a popularity contest. This is our lives friends."
"This woman has NEVER considered plan B?  What the, what the, “F”?!? Our country is drinking the Holistic coolAid"

The British are on top of their game.  They created Monty Python.
I really fear for the USA and the rest of the World if Harris is the next President.
Honeymoon time?<br><br>More like a “one night stand”.
lol wow how are these ppl aloud to jus lie on live tv to the whole country it so mind blowing
"She is like a chameleon that blends in with her audiences, and this is heard when she speaks with fake accents when speaking to certain people. She is... <br>Khameleon Harass."
She has no fucking idea what it takes to be an American a patriot or even a good person. She’s freaking stupid. She can’t carry a conversation and she can’t even make a decent sentence. God help us.
Sad that she was so little intellect.    Not a leader in any capacity.
She can't answer anything because she is a dummy!
She always looks drunk
"It’s it only sad,it’s scarey that some one so I’ll equipped for Presidency could win😈Vice Pres is not for her either! Biden was bad enough!?can’t have more of the same for 4 more years!?👁pay attention voters!!"
😮 this is crazy can we have a lie detector test please

Thank you Sky News.👍👏👏👏
Thank you Sky News.👍👏👏👏
🤮🤮🤮🤮
"The United States is the laughing stock of the world. If she is elected it will prove how stupid the American people are or prove how corrupt our voting system is. I have always been a registered Democrat, but not always voting that way. I decided 2 years ago to vote for Trump if he ran. I am so tired of being lied to by the Democratic party and really tired being lied to by the media. It takes a Australian news show to be truthful. Wake up America...we all know things were so much better when Trump was President. 🎉🎉🎉"
"Hey have built thousands of Manufacturing Warehouse’s in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Indiana.  Those Warehouses are completely EMPTY, NOT open for business….waiting for this election to fill those warehouses with SLAVE LABOR…..wake up America!  China is here and ready to roll out their “non-unión plants!"
"Look what Kamala did to California with all this crime, as attorney General she Was a failure.thats who some of you want running  this country  she will be instructed by Hilary, the legged mack daddy, and oprah"
I worked long hours every day but that dream she is taking about is long because of kamala Biden inflation it is not possible.we need president Trump for  that dream to come true
liar liar pants on fire😂
"SCAMala stated that Trump divided America. No, the Biden/Harris did. She  is single handedly making it worse. She truly tickles me when she says Donald Trump left the country in a economic disasters. She incontestably needs to STOP."
She's got to be the stupidest human I've ever seen or heard......she should be embarrassed....I damn sure won't be voting for her. Other countries are laughing at her!
I run Trump Rallies Car and Truck parades ! The amount of Trump Supports is fantastic !!  TRUMP!
The entire left is a exercise in stupidity!  The world's biggest problem is leftisim
Kamala can’t answer even a simple question .😱
But she will win along with her running mate Don Rickles
Dum dum. And people will vote for her. They can't say why.
I am a woman and I am not not voting for her!!!
"She's going to win, I hate to say it, but I believe that she the perfect person to finish what Biden started. The Dumbness must continue in order to destroy this nation and build a new government."
They had better print more money because our citizens are in trouble and this administration is the cause!
Who will elec5 her. She doesn’t know how.
"Kamala looks down when she is asked a question, shes a huge liar, try looking up, your an idot."
Lier!!!
Wow can she lie
"After the whole $750 while she sends trillions overseas the communist countries. I don’t see her when. I don’t know how those are going to vote, but they are not impressed with her whatsoever. She was passing around money. Those were our funds for disasters like this. If she gets away with this, we will all know it was rigged.  Trump’s cases are dropping because they were not just. This lady knows nothing and she is such a communist to boot."
That woman is out of her mind
Lies
She's not fit to be in any political office....lying about her race is despicable!
Life's a bitch.... Don't elect one. 🙄🤦🏼‍♀️
"Yeah, and raising corporate taxes is exactly the reason why corporations have all fled the country! Sure tax the companys that hire the people who issue the paychecks! Why do the damned left wingers think china is booming? And some other countrys? The tax on businesses should actuall be set at ""0"" and the u.s. would be booming right now! Jobs for everyone, but the taxaholic libtards just cant figure that out."
"She’s a liar, the interviewer is the worse and I’m not a smart woman but I could answer those questions way better than her😮"
She knows how to sided step the truth
"America is running for president with 4 or 5 other people, not just senile biden saying kamala is the democrats voted on pick !"
Pathetic that she was installed by the Dems
"Also Joe biden put forth that 25,000 housing grant, it gets voted down every year for 4 years !"
The only thing unraveling is this stupid YouTube channel and Donald Trump. Way to support insurrectionist traitor rapists! You're a disgrace!
She acts drunk
She lies so much she believes her lies.
Dosent the headline Trainwreck say it all.!😂
She's a liar !
She really is bad at talking she’s faking it(badly) til she tries to make it
Maybe she needs to get into bed with someone to assure the presidency...
America might have the worst president of all if Donald Trumps losses this time and the hardship will be more real this time economically because it seems like the Kamala Harris doesn't have enough experience and confidence in herself she is barely bold enough to answer some questions which are important to the Americans careful guys when voting. I am not American but I can definitely see through some worst mistakes😂😂😂
"She needs  to go back to California ,with the rest of the fruits,nuts, and flakes!"
Presidentette....<br><br>KAMALA PROPOSES TO MAKE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE...<br><br>CROSSING THE MEXICAN BORDER...<br><br>FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE IN AMERICA..<br><br>CREATE NEW AMERICAN DOLLAR...<br><br>COMBINE THE DOLLAR WITH THE MEXICAN peso...<br><br>CALLED THE AMERICAN peso<br><br>1 million american pesos buys 1 cigar<br>voters promising to vote for kamala<br>receives 1 million american pesos
"I am so sorry,  but she makes me ill when I listen to her. She doesn't know what she is talking about, and she is full of it"
"Where is she going to get the money? as usual, by printing it, isn't it obvious by now?"
She always get stuck on one word or another.Funny she needs help
I LOVE Sky News Australia
Please don't vote for Dingbat and Knucklehead!
I’m amazed that Kamala thinks she has the capability to be POTUS. Most people know their limitations. Kamala has no idea of how empty and incompetent she is.
"Claiming shes Black when shes not.. <br>""She was scared and it was showing, we all said Fuck you Bitch and kept going"".."
"She lies through her ass because her mouth knows better,"
Her level of disconnect is frightening. What world does she live in.
She makes me sick!! I pray she doesn’t cheat her way in like Biden did or America is in trouble! TRUMP 2024!!!
"I'm either Democrat or Republican but I can tell you this for a fact. The Democrats are out to wreck this country, the economy, and just absolutely lay waste to this great nation and if by chance and God forbid she does get into office. This everybody will see firsthand😮😢"
Trump vs Evil .
Why is she evn a candidate really thats all they could muster up
Harris is Pro Satan.
What is she smoking ?
"Evil intentions of the media  are on display. Simpleton puppets are shielded to promote the globalist's agenda to dissolve freedom. Worldwide slavery is what they want ,then depopulation. IT'S SATANIC .  TRUMP 2024. FEAR NOT ! GOD WINS IN THE END."
Too bad president job is not obtained on sexual means.
Polls are fake psyop bull to make people believe the narrative that this thing is even close. <br>ALL MEDIA ARE OWNED BY THE SAME PEOPLE.<br>What the hell is so hard to understand about that?
"Just get out there and work harder! It's magic, see!"
She is lying 🤥
That’s because she is a moron 😂
I really hate her voice!!! The most stupid woman in America!!!
"Obama: ""I need a VP dumber than me"". - picks Biden<br>Biden: ""I need a VP dumber than me"". - picks Harris<br>Harris: ""I need a VP dumber than me"". - picks Walz<br>I'm seeing a trend here.  The Democratic party kept spiraling into deeper stupidity.<br>Trump / Vance 2024."
"It doesn‘t matter how bad she is, people will still vote for her against Trump!"
"Some how they win, doesn't. Make sense"
"The Orange Buffoon and Boy Blunder are going down in the election, defeated by intelligent adults with plans for America's future. Not going back to the chaos created by the orange toddler in old man's skin.."
She always has knee pads on 😂😂😂
That’s how they fool the normies - they lie monumentally! Soft heads believe them.
We had way more money with Trump.. we are hurting now its unbelievable 🥺💜✝️🕯️🕊️
🤦🏾‍♂️… This mofo so dumb. 🫡… Trump 2024 🇺🇸
The dems didn't even want her in 2016. Spend an bribe
If shes crazy what does that say of the orange stupid?
I’m not president Trump but I approve this message!
FALSE NEWS!!!!
I had a former boss who used holistically all the time and it made me want to bang my head against a wall… she had zero understanding what it meant and neither does KH…
Any body want a salad
Holy wow
"Yes, absolute train wreck but Australia you don't have much room to speak. Some of the worst and most authoritarian restrictions in the world during COV"

TRUMP Wins
Trump Vance 2024.
The only hard she know about work is between willie B legs
Holistic new age? Dan
HARRiS HAS PROVED HERSELF TO BE AN OBOMINATION TO AMERICA over the last 4 years.
"I grew up middle class. Our neighbors mowed their lawns. We have ambitions, dreams, and aspirations. I will create an opportunity economy....hollistically i will say it 10 more times."
Omg that msnbc lady should be fired
"Guys that word means ,holes in the entire plan.😂"
Yay! A new filler word 🙄
"sobering up is hard shes trying to quit drinking sense we called her out so much,"
LIES LIES LIES THEY NEVER TIRE OF LYING 😮
She is still winning. Unfortunately too many idiots out there
Anybody understand any of that ????
She's polling ahead in almost every poll.<br>What do you mean?<br><br>The entire premise of this video is entirely dissmissable in one google search? There's dozens of entities that poll americans and almost all show Kamala marketly ahead?
"IF democrats didn't LIE, they'd never speak. TRUMP2024 !!"
Its amazing we have to look outside of the USA for Factual News about harris
How did a law degree
"Thanks br<br>Shame on those who vote for her , may God Save Us"
"She's sneaky she's low vibrational spirit she has no empathy for humanity to be honest a lot of these politician people don't have no empathy for humanity, and for the world. There's no peace and love in this world because many people are asleep spiritually people need to start waking up and start not depending on the matrix but start depending on God love and peace. I shall say that they're still hope for this world but just have faith in God 💚  and trust nobody but God. Project inner love and healing into yourself into the world and the start making positive changes within our community"
"OMG! Please save us President Trump.  MAGA, President Trump 2024 🇺🇸🦅🇺🇸"
She is no joke!!
"After using my brain holisticly, I come to the conclusion that she's the physical embodiment of a brain fart."
Yeah right 😅
The Democrats would vote for the ham sandwich. They're that brainless
"I swear...kamala,  Freeland and Trudeau have the word salad answers down pat. Top shelf liars! Lol😊"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k90LSk70ckU&t=200"">3:20</a>"
"She is a professional whore, what do you expect? She was on her knees to get her to where she is now."
"""Unraveling"" implies that a at some point, she ""had all together,"" which she needed did.  M.L. had the excuse of being young when she..um.. got involved in politics and she GREW UP and changed up her image- eventually.  Kamala is still making her mess."
Koala Harris. lol
"Optimism is not uniquely American.  Optimism is uniquely human. Sheesh!<br><br>How much more of the giggling, waving, and empty phrases can we take?"
I've lost touch with reality and can no longer differentiate between Kamala and SNL skits of her.

"Liar, running for our President? Stop the madness. Trump 2024"
everybody is laughing at her and everybody will be laughing at us if she wins 🤦
"Did I hear her say millionaires. I guess that includes her Obama, Hillary, Pelosi, Oprah, and the rest of them I’d like to see them pay their share . They go after the working people. they can barely afford to buy food for their children. I would challenge her to live on 1200 a month. Let’s see how she would live with that amount. After you pay your rent, you don’t have no money to pay your light bill. You have no money for food and thank God I don’t have a car because I can’t afford a car payment or gas for that car or the taxes and tag. In small towns we don’t have the city bus."
America is not your dildo !!!
It's rigged. Get used to another apoplectic president.
"I cant believe that some people are STUPID ENOUGH TO VOTE FOR someone like her, SAD."
Just say no to Kammunism.
STOP your shameful LYING!
Harris is incompetent …
Kamala has an economic plan...take money from those who earn it and give it to people who didn't earn it.  It is going to be the financial rape of working people.
"Wake up, people! She's a disaster unfolding with a bunch of rich liberal billionaire elitist and liberal media babing her,  so nothing changes. Wake up, people!!! Yes, Trump has personality issues, but you know what he's saying and where he's coming from."
"Everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie! Can she please make a coherent statement just once? These conditions that we live in now didn't exist when Trump was president!!! Does she think the public is dumb? Some are loss, but most are intelligent. Never never answer questions directly. Only the simple-minded will support this nonsense"
"Dream,love, ambitions it's a shame."
"Excellent statement Rita. ""Empty platitudes"""
Why do you think china Russia and Iran want her to win?  Because she will be bulldozed by them
"massively taxing corporations and billionaires is only gonna hurt the little people because they'll just put their prices up. She really hasn't got a clue. You need to drill baby drill. But she's all about no fracking but then they buy the oil from venezuela & saudi arabia. She is just a air head. She is so racist to call herself 'Black'. I don't know why blacks can't see it. If Trump claimed to be 'Black' they'd see it. Why would they continue to enslave themselves again with the democrats. That kind of thinking makes you understand why they chose to be slaves in bygone times. It's like saying ""My thinking cap isn't working"" so ""can i please return to slavery & i'll through in my future off springs as slaves aswell"". It makes me ashamed of black. Profound !"
How did she graduate from law school ???
"Deep down inside, she's an empty vessel with no brain and bullshit in the absence of a real agenda! She and this administration have done  NOTHING for the AMERICAN PEOPLE and EVERYTHING for 20 million ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS!! VOTE TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT!!❤️🇺🇲💪"
“Let’s be inspired to think about being inspired..it’s truly inspiring “ <br>~Kamala “Salad Toss” Harris
If her and waltz are the best they can dich up after crooked Joe the only way they are going to win is steal the election like the last one I would guess.
She is such a DUMB ASS
She doesn’t know what she’s doing
"She's an idiot, holistically!"
"The Dems want her to be president, it's just a bit much for them to also demand she have all her marbles. That would be a bit... hypocritical of them."
a lot similar to wait for it ….. our Alboneasy
she need mental help
It looks like Carmela gets more and more darker in her face or I have something with my eyes?!
You are doing exactly what you say the other team is doing.
Q: What is your plan? Harris: I grew up in a middle class family. Trump: I will lower energy costs by 50% in 12 months. No comparison!!!
😂😂😂<br>Tf? Stop making sh*t up!!!!
There is no way she is close to tump number they are lying because they are going to install her no matter what. She is gonna be president. They will cheat and we need to be ready to fight
She has nothing that makes a U.S presidential candidate
Kamala Harris talks more like rat salad from Black Sabbath than word salad.
She A Clown 🤡🤡🤡
"First it was Joe Biden scaring the hell out of everybody feeling like we've just been invaded by another planet when that guy became president with the mask on the black mask and 26,000 National Guard soldiers with M60 machine guns around the Capitol building with razor wire talk about intimidating now somehow Kamala Harris is the president now and now we get to be terrified by Kamala Harris that she's going to cut our testicles off and put them in our mouth and torture us at the same time so we've been tortured by Joe Biden for 3 years now we're being tortured by Kamala Harris Fear Factor up the bunghole make us so petrified of our own shadow now that Kamala Harris is in control of everything and everybody it's like man I should just run right in front of a speeding train cringe isn't the word I don't know what the word is or the feeling but it's not good"
Welcome to fantasy island 🏝
You gotten to be a special kinda stupid to want 4 more years of this hell
Camela is DISGUSTING!!!!! She is NOT a leader!
She lies. The jobs were thriving before the pandemic. Your administration took credit for the jobs that came back.
What is sad so many still want her here no matter what she does.
God is she stupid?
Watch for her nose flare; her being vice President. That's right boys and girls she's already in the office and what has she done for us the past couple of years
The 'facts' are harris and the dems are lying communist pigs.
That bimbo
It's frightening that out of the millions & millions in the US these are the best  they come up with ffs😢
"I think the only people voting for her will be 2 groups:  there are women who plan to vote for her simply because she is a woman,  the second group will vote against Trump.  Not because they like her, but because they hate Trump.   <br>I can't fathom any other reason to vote for her. There are young women who will vote for anyone who will allow them to play around with reproduction, rather than taking the ability to reproduce as a sacred opportunity.  I heard one such young female   (NOT A LADY!) say how glad she was that she had been able to have that little life ripped from her body limb by limb.  She kept saying how she loved doing that.  I almost threw up listening to such evil come out of her mouth."
"F*ck Kamala, F*ck Biden, this election year 2024 I never voted before but I don't like any of the sh*t that has been happening in the U.S. so I'm registered to vote and I'm voting for Trump"
Why is Sky News Media so much better than our (USA) media??
Think Wisely America <br>THIS IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT <br>I VOTED FOR AT ALL A JUSE IS ALLOWED Biden A GO AHEAD WITH <br>STUDENT LOAN That's A FLUSH TO<br>HURRICANE DEAD VICTIMS ARE LYING AROUND NOT GOOD REMEMBER MAUI NOW WHERE IS THAT MONEY COMING FROM FOR STUDENT LOAN'S 🤔 PRAYER'S TO <br>HURRICANE VICTIMS RIP🙏😇🙏<br><br>🚨VOTE WISELY AMERICA 🚨
megyn kelly looks like a man !
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k90LSk70ckU&t=582"">9:42</a> she speaks exactly how I used to write my papers in college when I needed to fill the word count 😂😂"
"I am in shock that the Democrats think that K.Harris is their best example of an educated strong woman to be the leader of our nation. She is not aware that the majority of us are hard working, responsible people."
Taxing the hardworking is the end of their game with that evil party.
"That Kamala is a train wreck is an understatement. We are involved with two wars, we have a major port strike, high inflation, millions of unvetted people in the country, high prices on food, fuel, etc. and she done nothing about any of this.  <br>The one city and state she represented is a train wreck.  Highest taxes in the nations. People sleeping on the streets. Shit and needles all over the streets of SF. Businesses pulling out. Crime in all cities, but especially in SF out of control.  She has done nothing to advance her positions<br>She would be a disaster for this country."
Most public policy involves getting people to work and start paying taxes to share the load of living in a democracy.   Harris is a liar.
Idk if this Moron no's  that when you buy a house and you are a first time buyer 6mon to a year later you sell your house and buy another you are now a first time buy so this 25kfor  is going to bankrupt the country I no iam on my 3rd house and getting ready to buy my 4th in Feb and the way that you is you don't pay taxes which I have never had to pay
She is pure evil
She’s just crazy
Kamala loves that philosophical horse crap !!! That's why her answers turn into wordsalad nonsense
"She talks and talks and when she shuts up, I don’t know what she just said except “where we have been” what is that??????"
THEY KNOW THEY CAN LIE THEIR WAY INTO OFFICE WITH THE MEDIA HELPING THEM!
"Kamala and Trump are not capable of running this country. Truth is they actually don't. Kamala is certainly the lesser intelligent and educated to be the mouthpiece. Trump isn't much brighter. Again, they are just talking heads for a much bigger power."
She's only capable of being the president of the imbecile Club
LAIR Lair that is all she nos
Ooooo big words
BIDEN said WE CANNOT BE TRUSTED!! Vote ❤❤❤ TRUMP/ VANCE 2024❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Don't know why the most unpopular VP in history would win.

That's cause she's a fraud
I hate to watch her.

Her plan sucks!
It’s dry heaving!
I didn’t know you could catch Dementia of someone else because it looks like she’s caught it off crooked Joe
"She didn’t win the elections fair and Square. She didn’t do anything, but she just took over Biden‘s people. She didn’t have any delegates. This is one woman I do not want as my first woman president. I am a woman and I want to be proud to have a smart woman in the White House, and she’s just a little giggling girl"
Thank you for sharing that That's awesome
"""A train wreck,"" you say ?<br>Id say ,more like a <br>""train wrecker""!"
"Hey Youtube Censors.  Time for you to re-calibrate to the truth, Kamala Harris is a worthless turd.  stop trying to hide the truth you worthless stupid Fucker Youtube Censors."
I mean...maybe...but she's not a rapist which makes her the only option 🤷‍♂️
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k90LSk70ckU&t=44"">0:44</a> bit hypocritical saying she is getting a ""free run"" when the only thing sky news australia posts about are critical against the left???"
Great she wants to raise gas prices food housing which is now in New York going up as I type
Ich hasse ihr ständiges lachen
She's Just a holistic person lol 😅😊
LMAO WHAT A DISASTER!!!! FREAKING CIRCUS CLOWN HARRIS.
I holistically know that if Kamala wins she will destroy America!
"On housing,  Kamilian Harris, eyes just crushed, I can see her brain having a short circuit. To much ignorance concentrated in one brain."
"If you really want honest news we have to go out of our own country,these people are real reporters!!!!!"
You can't leave the person in charge of the problem that created the  problem  in the first place! TRUMP 2024!!!
Wants us all to be hard working s9 we can get taxed into oblivion!!!!!!
Just goes to show how uninformed the liberal pukes really are!!!!!
"Whats the point of having dreams when she doesn't know how to stop lying, Trump 2024  she can't manage the border and no good plan to grow the economy"
It's a FACT that que-mala is where she is due to special favors that started with Mr. BROWN in California.  As a woman I'm simply DISGUSTED BY HER & EVERYTHING SHE REPRESENTS.
She never had a honeymoon  with America.  It's been a FAKE narrative by msm playing cover for the political joke the American CITIZENS NEVER VOTED FOR !!!!!!!!!!!
Kamala is a Scam!!!
CAN You imagine this  word salad BS for 4 more years!!! Please vote Trump / Vance 2024!!!❤❤❤
"If she doesn't know the facts, she's telling you what's she supposed to tell you, because somebody told her to say it, because they don't like Trump, and I can tell you who Pelosi and chuck Schumer."
Corrupt communist
"😂🎉 and she's a dummy, you just don't know how to talk about this country or anything? This shows how stupid she really is. And she can't be a President."
Since the “other” relief flights are all connected to Catholic and other Christian religions Kamala is against them even if it results in hardship and/or deaths!
Please let us be unburdened by what has been .....which has been a F'n nightmare <br>the last 4 years ...... If more than half the American people can't stand Kamala Harris <br>Just imagine what World leaders might think of her....
Lol  😂   Hahaha  🤣 🤣🤣🤣
That’s a lie The Economy was booming with Trump there were Jobs. Kamala needs to answer a question and have a solution to solve the problems that she helped create with Biden administration. She has no plan on how to do any of this.
Imagine covering other countries politics
"Democrats are UNSUITABLE for giving orders, they should TAKE ORDERS (As in ""Do you want fries with that, sir?"")"
It sounds like Kamala's holistic aspiration needs some inspiration...
Her stupidity has no bounds.
"The biggest thing people can do before they vote is compare Trump and Harris and the job they have done. Kamala has completely destroyed the country claiming she will make everything better yet forgets to recognize she's the one that has caused the problems. She has allowed 425,431 unvetted illegals to freely roam the country with murder convictions,  sexual assault convictions, rape convictions, robbery convictions and assault convictions. She has also allowed 222,141 unvetted illegals to freely roam the country with pending murder charges,  pending sexual assault charges, pending rape charges,  pending robbery charges and pending assault charges. Plus 2,000,000 get aways. She signed the Inflation Reduction Act  that had nothing to do with reducing inflation and caused exorbitant inflation,  and attached to the bill was to give billions of tax payers dollars to other countries. She signed the Green New Deal which is also part of the cause of inflation as well, and again attached in that bill was to give other countries billions of taxpayers' dollars. She ripped up the sanctions Trump had on Iran in which they handed over 16 billion in taxpayers dollars which allowed them to buy ballistic missiles. When Trump was in office we had one of the most secured borders, our cost of living was tremendously lower and we had mo wars gping on. To me, it's very clear which candidate is better for the American citizens. Donald J. TRUMP."
We have complete dumbassed running this country.
How is she going to raise the money? Ask Zelensky to help you out LOL you sent him billions so his wife could spend money on expensive spending sprees and cocaine for him 🤣 maybe he's got some money left over 🤣🤣🤣
CAN'T EVEN ANSWER A QUESTION AND THE LIES TOO BOOT
"It's weird seeing a negative news report about her, which is kinda sad."
"""UHH... BUH-BUH-BUH....."" As King Carlos would say, WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP!"
Kamala better do research herself! Because she has no help she fired or the help chose to quit ! She is disgusting! Not any type of qualities for any White House position!im sure billionaires pay taxes already! She is so mindless! Let’s look at her income and her Trust fund in China ??
Never thought I’d ever see anything close to Michael Dukakis or Jimmy Carter.  Glad Carter was able to outlive his Presidential mealy mouthing whatever subject but he (they) contributed to the foolishness!
Kamala better do research herself! Because she has no help she fired or the help chose to quit ! She is disgusting! Not any type of qualities for any White House position!
she never gives answers only word salads but when she  does she LIES BIG TIME! Isn't she embarrassed? Anyone can see she lies and lies and lies! She should hide under a rock and never come out again!
Wow she has no chance in hell
Oh here we go again another Word Salad😢
Thank you for sharing this treasonous witch!
"Only short-sighted idiots refuse to understand that business taxes are a cost of doing business, and are passed on to the consumer."
She has always been a trainwreck
What a big dummy
PLEASE cut the background elevator music. it's annoying and distracting.
"IS THAT ALL VOMIT WITH NO WRETCH, O! M! G! I HAVEN'T LAUGHED SO HARD N MONTHS TY!!! OMG"
"They could have pick  really everyone else. Anyone is better then biden, but no, they choose Kamala that is worse 😅😅😅😅"
KAMALA’s HUSBAND IS JEWISH!!! SHE STANDS WITH ISREAL AND SO DOES TRUMP!
She is in the White House already lady🤣
Im inspired to vote for Trump ❤!!!
"Can you imagine her sitting down and talking with Putin? <br>And tell me why she keeps blaming everything on Trump when shes the one in office, and has been for the past 3.5 yrs. What an absolute train wreck! Democrats have caused the mess <br>we're in now."
"And then when she's talking about raising corporate taxes and making sure that the ""billionaires"" pay their fair share....... There they go again being so eat up with Donald Trump and being jealous of the fact that he's worth more money than they are and he didn't cheat to get any of it that they just can't stand it so that's all they can think about!!!!!!!!!"
We all know she's incompetent but she'll win by hook or by crook.
"kamela, MAY be ""unraveling', BUT you would NEVER know this if your only source of 'news' was from the Communist Party's ""Ministry of Truth"", and the adoring, drooling, unquestioning, propagandists of the American MEDIA.<br><br>Thankfully Sky News Australia provides an accurate, objective look at American politics, and the consequences that WILL occur should the Communists and their 'soiled doves' in  the MEDIA STEAL the election, as they did in 2020."
Look at evil Hillary with Kamala Disgusting Deep State Illuminati Blood Sucking Vampires
Just a jack ass
"Kamala Harris is just A STUPID LIAR!!  You can't fix STUPID Harris!!  The democrats have been selling out American starting with OBAMA!!!  Obama is in his THIRD TERM and DOES NOT need HIS FOURTH TERM through the microphone in Harris's ear like he did Biden's!!  The best shape the OUR county has in was when TRUMP WAS and WILL BE President!!!  Harris has NOT done ONE thing during her VP, so WHY would she be a president when she is A LAZY ASS getting paide to do ABSOLUTLY NOTHING!!  When she said ""will just HAVE to raise taxes, sounds to me a little like CHINA!!"
Kamala es mentirosa de nacimiento.😮😮
She sounds like she is high as a kite
"I wish that in America, all of our media companies weren’t gotten paid for by the same people who spew this nonsense"
The Biden administration is the problem
"Sadly it doesn't matter that she's a lying, whoring, unqualified, diversity hire that used her purple bacon to make it to the white house she's easy to control and the powers that be don't want a leader they want a puppet so unfortunately she's gonna probably gonna ""win"""
2020 was stolen by the democrats!  Stolen!!
Whoever supports Harris something wrong with your brain cells.  So brainwashed. They mush not love our country if you vote Harris.
"Clearly, Kamala has no idea what she's doing. She is NOT qualified for the presidency."
SKY NEWS.... I WILL LIKE TO SAY AMAZING JOB!!!! LOVE YOUR NEWS TEAM. MUCH LOVE FROM THE USA!!! 🇺🇸
Don’t understand why democrats thought a mentally impaired Kamala could beat Trump and  a mentally impaired Joe couldn’t
"She always say the same speech . Kamala has no policies, she has no plan. Her plan id draining the middle-class people. We are sick of Kamala."
She needs to go back to California and retire like Obama that is from Illinois and lives on the east coast cause he knows it is shit show 🎯💯💥👊🏻🇺🇸
Far worse than Joe and Gwen is a sinker!
australian reporting is ridiculous
Thank you SKY NEWS AUSTRALIA!!<br>Santa Barbara California Loves Loves Loves you !!!!!<br>Phuc you KONMALA and all who supports her!! God danm you all
This interviewer is in bed with harris and the Communists libturds
Kamala has visions that are communistic
About time!
Thanks form Houston Texas for covering this
She needs to buy the App ChatGPT 😂😂
Must have been his senility that led Biden into choosing her for VP in the first place.
She’s so phony
Learn how to say her name. Don’t you have anything interesting going on in AU?
"I hole istic lee think holistically she is , the holistic lady of holistisity."
"What a surprise that the person no one voted for when she did run for president, and no one considered for VP until she was a last minute pick by Biden, is a very poor choice for the presidency. Despite being puffed up by media."
Candence Owens made a nice research on her white/hindu family
SHE KNOWS NO FACTS! ALL SHE KNOWS IS HOW TO LIE LIKE A DIRTY DOG!
I'm from CT US and go to sky news for at least 70% of my news !!!!
"It will be a mercy to Harris to lose the election. If she wins, she will endure 4-years of relentless public exposure and humiliation. No one enjoys being a fool, especially as the first ""black"", female American president. Her disastrous example would be a tragedy for the progress of women everywhere in the public square."
Here's one thing that is not being said.<br>IF she raises taxes on the large corporations and billionaires.<br>Their taxes hikes will trickle down to higher prices on everything <br>The middle class will have to pay for everything. And that is FACT
Yeah we're going to vote for Trump can't handle four more years of what we got none of us will be alive
“May the odds always be in your favor”
The real question will Libs wake up and see this COMMIE for what she is an America Hater.
She always interviews like she's just smoked a blunt.
You raise taxes we go to poverty the people will go to Poverty If they raise any more taxes at this point in time
Why are they not held to a higher standard of behavior. If you blantantly cannot tell accurately rhen you shpuld be removed or charged. <br>Make an oath like in court. This is getting absurd.
There's no tie!!!  Trump actually is up by +20 across the board.<br>🇺🇲Trump🇺🇲 2024
"I think President Obama is who would be really running the country with her face because he cant do the job legally.  She has NO IDEA how to run this country. How could she, she cant even answer a simple question."
I can’t wait to see her reaction when she loses the election to Trump it’s going to be Hillary all over again
Fake news
Kramallah is truly an idiot
Your visa
"Kamala is the biggest liar and a corrupt politician, the worst is that the democrat even willing to commit treason to win the election.....totally dispicable, I hope all American can see that<br><br>God bless America ❤️........from Malaysia"
More bull shit from the Trumpies.  Only now with an Aussie accent.  Trump is going down the toilet and his suck up fascist wannabes know it.  😂
Sky news😲😲..you do good honest reporting..thought the elite bought you too...<br>Thank you i must say..show the real news..
That's bad when the lie factory CNN calls you put.
Oprah needs to be cancelled also
JILL STEIN 2024 💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
"They will lie to get her elected like they did for biden even tho I cannot find one person that wants her and most of the comments I read even back when biden was running nobody wanted them. <br>I drove half way cross pa and didn’t see one biden sign besides 3 miles from my house rest all trump and he was winning when I went bed and somehow woke up n he biden won Pennsylvania,ya right thieves."
"Check out that $60,000 necklace she's been wearing. She went to the border wearing it."
shes high asf
They had 4 years to find a qualified candidate but we're to busy stealing from American tax payers and corruption
"The most terrible type of salad on the world is WORD SALAD! Kamala's word salad: ""Holistically""."
Dumb as a box of rocks do not let her lead this country
She's always waving her hands around becaue she needs some kind of sign language to make up for her inability to express coherent thought.
"Lies, lies, lies all based on lies, the Abortion issue is so false, anyone who lives in the ghettos & barrios,illegals since 1970’s could go to the clinics proved by Planned Parenthood’s murder factory and minority women were ENCOURAGED to have free abortions (1st hand knowledge) Trump is against a Plan Parenthood quest to rid America’s to stop minorities from ever being born, this is what Kamala supports, huge $$$$$ involved corruption all these years."
She has nothing to offer she can do nothing but lye.
Kalamama's eye's glaze over when she tries to think of something smart to say but she tries too hard to sound like Obamama but she's not intelligent enough to hide it and pull it off she also  has a little Bill Cosby she trows in for personality.
The illusion of choice.
"Only huge money can make her look half decent, half human. Black women in her circle have been verbally abused and fired just for not handing her the “r favorite pen” to sign."
The bad thing is that so many believe in her nothingness.  Such fools followers of a Pied Pipper. I feel sorry for them.
Absolute liar...no lost manufacturing jobs.
Flibertyjibbit.
Please show this to the world!
Holistic equalistic nice
Terrible person to be president
I can’t afford to live in a dream.
I'll take Kamala over Dumb Trump any day.
"She doesn't control Blackrock , vanguard, or largest corporations."
"She's nothing but a<br> hollow husk, old bag of lies...."
The term is word soup! SOUP not salad
I am so inspired to vote for Trump. How’s that for being inspired 😅
She truly makes Americans look stupid
Harris is the worst ever. My dogs are smarter
"Absolutely not qualified to run anything, what a disaster."
"Too many leftists don't care. We have an ""I want"" society. They want federal abortion rights. They don't care about the country. Socialism sounds great as long as they get free money, health care,  etc."
SHE HAS TURNED BACK ON HELPLESS FROM HURRICANE..SHE REFUSED HELP NO MONEY IN FEMA
"<b>THE INTERVIEWER'S CLOTHING AND HAIR STYLE, PRESENTS HER AS A VERY LOW ON THE PECKING ROW, OF THE SUBBASEMENT CHAMBERS</b>"
Shameful!
How can pple vote for her .she buys votes
Only one word...Pathetic. <br>Even when Helene is leaving havoc all true the US. She's out campaigning and Biden is at the beach side...<br>Donald Trump is visiting the regions that took a hit. He is the only one that does what presidents do.<br>I can't see another 5 minutes more....
Artificial intelligence for president!
Just answer the question!!! Please !! That’s it.    Unreal
Absolutely clueless and stupid!
Stupid coruption oozes from her.full demons
"😢, "" + PRAISE AND GLORY ONLY TO LORD, JESUS CHRIST.!AMEN. HALLELUJAH.!""<br><br>This Woman (Harris), totally  did somethings(substance).,<br>No thought.! Citizens  we are not ""dumb millioans.!"""
"KADINI HEMEN İNFAZ ETMEYE BAŞLADINIZ!  OBAMA’DAN BUŞH’DAN, TRUMP’DAN DAHA KUVVETLİ VİCDANI VE ÖN SEZİSİ VAR! SEÇMEN DEĞİLİM AMA, AMERİKAYA DAHA GÜVENİLİR BİR İMAJ GETİRİR DİYE DÜŞÜNÜYORUM! 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷"
Hag.she wont help americans.she knows no truth.she is a witch
Wait for the LIE after she says “ this is what I know and the facts” <br>What a stupid brainless cow
Rem pple the hurricane .she wont help no one.pple dieing no help for them suffering
"Over the significant passage of time, I have been holistically inspired to be unburdened by what has been so that the thing that can be could happen in a holistic manner. Don't you agree? Asking for a neighbor who loves his lawn, holistically speaking of coarse!!<br>🇺🇸Trump 2024🇺🇲"
We don't like Kamala.... LITERALLY at this point she's embarrassing herself we see what she did with the border 🙄 soooo Yeah 👎
shaking her head no the entire time.... she doesn't even buy it herself. lol
"Yeh she has ambition, and aspirations... TO BRING DOWN THE COUNTRY FROM WITHIN."
"Lies, lies and more holistic lies 🤥🤥🤥"
"She's basically just bluffed her way to the top, but people can now see right through it, like a window!!"
Sky news is for trump😅
"The scary thing is no matter how bad she does in interviews or on stage giving incoherent speeches, there are still a large amount of people who would still vote for her because they either hate Donald Trump or they like she's brown and female."
"Shaking of the head ""no"" while answering is a subliminal message."
"She can't do the job and the sooner she faces that the better off she'll be, so eat that Obama."
She 😅😅is a LIAR !!!
Kamala is like a teenager trying to hit a word count but didn't do the work nor read the subject matter.
"Poor Democrats have only one choice! This Kamala disaster! Even a brain dead Biden is better than this pathetic, wanna be dictator! This race is over and America’s looking at a Trump Vance landslide victory!"
The only thing shes qualified for is swallowing  a hot load.
Shut up Kamala please!!😂
Weird! Merriam-Webster-Webster just “updated” the definition of holistic on 9/22/24. 😂<br>I had never heard that word used like that until Kamala did it.
She is done
She's just imitating Trump.
The media is controlled by the Democrats it would not surprise me if they're being paid off by the Democratic Party
What a liar complete liar Lowlife our country is turning into a train wreck Trump all the way
HOASSHARRIS 👎 👎
WE AINT GOT A G G GOOD BRAIN.....
We need to be unburdened by what has been. 😖
"So many Demoncrats hate trump, and believe all the bogus charges against him, the will vote for someone who has no clue/qualifications on being president!"
This is the sign of the devil saying this 3 X just like 66+
"Inspire us, let inspire, inspire, inspire........ ? What was the question 🤔"
"Don’t worry, they will cheat again like they did with Joe Biden in 2020. Joe Biden was just as bad as her or worse. It doesn’t matter how many people vote for Donald Trump, the deep state government and the leftist Democrat Marxist will use the mail in votes, dead people votes, whatever it takes. The United States is doomed."
Kamala is a freeloader  Indian entitled Snowflake her father is a Professor shes not working class.
Once again thank you so much for supporting the United States you guys are awesome! We don’t have to ask Kamala Harris what her policies on the border the economy foreign policies are     She has shown us over the last 3 1/2 years what she supports! <br>She has proven to be nothing but a monumental liar and the United States will suffer even more under her presidency! I have to say that the thought of that is the most terrifying thing I can imagine! 🤮🤬
She does not have any good answers !!!  She lies and lies !!! Please wake up !!!! <br> Thank you for reporting the truth !!! 🇺🇸✝️🙏🦅 Trump/Vance 24
She does not have any good answers !!!  She lies and lies !!! Please wake up !!!! <br> Thank you for reporting the truth !!! 🇺🇸✝️🙏🦅 Trump/Vance 24
"Sadly, a large number of Harris supporters can name multiple Taylor Swift songs, but can't tell you a single idea or policy Kamala has to offer. They just simply support who they have been told to support and have no clue why."
"What are her real policies?<br>First time homebuyers <br>What about the people that lost their houses and homes because of Covid when they took Office? <br>They cannot afford to get into another home so they are destined to live in an apartment <br>And rents are outrageous home buying is out of control <br>Yet you forget about the people  that lost everything under you and Biden<br>Tax deduction for newborn babies but lower deduction for parents with children. Our veterans live on the street VA helps as much as they possibly can.<br>She don’t care about the war they’re making money off of it<br>They can send billions over to help other countries, but not this country<br>What a shame<br>Illegals and migrants get more and don’t do nothing for it and yet you’re out there busting your butt trying to make a living trying to eat trying to live trying to put a roof over your head and she’s doing nothing for us<br><br>God help America we need you more now than we ever did"
She is such a LIAR! I hate liars! 😠 😡
Trump pull us through covid with stimulus checks.karmala only helps Ukraine an immigration to forgot about us American
"Harris has always been considered one of the most unlikable, disliked people in politics. Even her party members and employees loathe her. One campaign employee recently quit and came forward with just how Kamala treats everyone. The female employee said unless you are an extremely high dollar donor, Kamaly will not even speak to you. She further said that Kamala has frequent staged appearances for the cameras and for show only."
Lie's from Harris
"Anyone who did not know Whore Harris is a complete MORON is also a complete MORON. Fortunately, for Whore Harris dumicrap voters vote for dumicrap politicians because they are dumicraps."
You keep using that word……. I don’t think you know what it means!
Did someone whack her in the head with a frying pan. She has nothing useful to say. Everything seems to be a joke to her. Another bubble head to try and run the country
That women  😂😂😂 worse vice presidential  candidate  ever
Trump 2024
"Cnn keep telling the truth like that CNN I might start listening. Thanks for Correcting Miss, information.well done ✔️"
Ya your dreaming 😂
liar kamala!!
"it's the same with her running mate Tim Waltz, he dont know what he is talking about!"
You can from her tone how emotionally unstable and frustrated she is
Harris is looking ahead to the mansion in Martha’s vineyard next to obamas she don’t know crap about being President
She is not qualified to be president of the United States
Harris lies ever time she speaks so she would be well of to shut up
I can't stop laughing!! I really can't!! <br>And the dribble she sprouts isn't even true!! Baaahahahahaha!!
She makes it up as she goes!
Kamala Harris is a vacuous mess and I despise every single person that supports her.
Kamala was never wound tight with real ideas to start with. The idea that anyone would vote for her is perverse at best.
She is holistic not a good candidate. Making US laughing stock of the world. She makes no sense.
Not the brightest match in the box . Surely the US has more educated people than this gibberish!
Deep state knows she won't win. As we speak? The world is at war. This is all a massive distraction
"WTF,  ?!?!"
As bad as kamala is worse than joe people will still vote for her cause shes a fake black women and cause they hate trump unbelievable. And this are the people complaining on how bad the economy is that they are leaving california.
We All know she has the ear piece in.  Same same same 😢
As my grandmother used to ask my grandfather when he upset her...When was the last time you had a 2 x 4 🪵 across you're knees...Pretty much sums up the state of Affairs in the U.S...Oh well...Boa Sorte from Portugal...🇵🇹👌😎👊
If you the people don’t like Kamala for president then just don’t like her for president. <br>Don’t dislike her because of people like this news anchor and Candace Owens. <br>These people are purposely fighting against her simply because they are for Donald Trump. <br><br>And it is very normal to slander the opposition party in politics whether truth or lies
"People aren't voting for Kamala just because of her color.  The other guy cratered the stock market, saw 1M needlessly die from disease, ballooned the trade deficit with China, completely abdicated on gun violence and climate change, and then led an armed coup against his own citizens."
😈
Stupid people will still vote for her!
“Holistically Inspired” 😂🤣
BS vote blue anyone is better than Trump
At least dopey Joe had dementia to blame what’s her excuse?
"She is so dumb it stinks to Heaven only really Idiots would fall for her, in the Bin and close the Lid quality"
"I would not let her clean my Toilet what a <a href=""http://s.um/"">s.um</a> bag calling her stubit would just  upgrade her . looking at her makes me  feel sick"
Like I say to people i understand why you don't like Trump but how on earth you can vote for these 2 useless Clints is beyond me 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
TRUMP🇺🇸❤️👍
Kabala Harris will take your money and give it to others😮
She and Joey got us trillions more dollars in DEBT!!! 21 MILLION ILLEGALS HELPED THEY MADE US SPEND FOR THAT TRAVESTY
❤❤Lets Welcome Our Former and Future President Donald J Trump and Our Beautiful First Lady Melania Back ❤️🌷❤️🌷❤️
THE ULTIMATE SOCK PUPPET FOR THE EVIL BLUE DEEP STATE WHO WANT ANOTHER 4 YEARS FOR THE OBAMA CABAL AND THE GOAL......AMERIZUELA FOR OUR NATION
I'm not voting for that Witch! She always sidesteps and avoid direct questions and answers irrelevantly. <br>She's mentally incompetent of leading the USA.
So full of 💩!
Kamala = Marxist.
One of Diddy's best friends.
Trump is a successful businessman <br>Kamala has a vagina
When 350 million choose this …..<br>Well it’s clear the world will end soon <br>I’m stunned at the stupidity listening to the nonsense comes out her mouth . <br>Truly dumbfounding.
"Love your channel, thank you for bringing honesty to us. Fox is the only honest network we have in America ❤."
OMG PRESIDENT???
I love you all in Sky News!! Thank you from the USA. 💕
When you're holistically retarded it still makes you a retard
"35 trillion dollars. Where did it go? Haitians, illegal immigrants, hotel rooms 50k in debit cards, that's where it's going."
If you vote for her you hate america
Well you asked who could be a bigger retard than Joe Biden and here she is
WE ARE NOT VOTING ON HIGHSCHOOL PROM COURT. THIS ISN'T A FEELING CONTEST. PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLDS LIVES DEPENDING ON THIS.
"That is Kamala in a nutshell, glad to tell you what she will do but no explanation on how she will do it."
The “press” are bending over backwards as they creep in the slime in their swamp
Im inspired to VOTE TRUMP THANKS
🎧🎭⚠️ ‘Ms. ‘Camela’ 🐪🐫 !!!👅🤪
"Wait until she unleashes on this strike!If you are an illegal you are in her plan but not for the real American.,Biden did not create but cut thousands!!"
Kamaller:)
Let kamala be kamala and her true colors will come out
How they have those  number?  Because a lot of us no answer any question about this.
?
If her hands was tied to her sides. She could not talk. Reminds me of a kindergarten teacher over animated hand gestures.
Great reaction from Oprah. Bewildered and lost with what she said.
If Kamala did interviews topless. Her ratings could improve but I'd still vote Trump!
"Apparently she thinks big words makes her look intelligent, wrong."
If winning the presidential election consisted of a dick sucking contest she would win without any real competition
"If taxes are raised for large companies, they will increase the costs of what they produce. The millionaires are the owners of the companies. The rest of the citizens are affected."
"Her head is shaking ""NO"" the whole time she is talking!😮"
"Miss Kelly be  HOLISTIC inspiration  ,question the that  idea work????"
"IF KAMALA has to been found to have a brain,it was borrowed,no way that woman can run AMERICA,she don't even know what color she is,don't even ask her,she'll lie"
"It doesn't matter how stupid she speaks, how bad her policies are, or how corrupt she is, the Left will vote for her because they hate Trump.  They would rather see our country fail before they vote for him.   They're voting 100% on feelings and not on policies,  track record, etc.  Our county was strong and resource independent under Trump...look at us now.   And these people will vote for 4 more years of this failed administration because they believe the garbage and lies from the left-winged media."
Is this really the best your country has to offer ?. What happened to the the America the world looked up to ? It's lost  to Hollywood standards....everyone is an  expert based  on their bank account/ or their  designer clothing.
the queen devil of evils and lies evil and lies evil and lies
she's the queen devil of evil and lies evil and lies and that's all there is to it and Facebook is for her because they block everything I put on there
Harris should never have been allowed to run for her local golf club.
She would be better to give up her ambition like Biden than to create an embarrassing firestorm into the World American leadership.
❤Trump❤ Vance❤2024❤
she keeps repeating her garbage on mic and video.
"HOLISTIC, ???? QUE ALGUIEN EXPLICA LO DE HOLISTIC ,SOLO EN INDIA HAY MUY BUENAS HOLISTIC PERSONAS QUE CURAN ILLNESS  DE MANERA HOLISTIC"

Jesus dude. Do your research. Bill Mahr is an old school liberal who constantly attacks far left liberals. Do a search on him and sexualizing children and you will find a ton of videos where he calls out hollywood and the left for exploiting children. He hates them.

TAYLOR SWIFT IS NOT A PSYOP
"RED FLAGS REASONS FOR NOT DATING OR MARRYING WESTERN WOMAN.<br>What are the red flags a lot of WESTERN women display:<br>  1. Call herself a boss b@tch, a bad twitch, they are good for hit and run, pump and dump, and anyone who has one of them in a serious relationship needs to seek help. especially if they think about marrying them, You need to take a good look at yourself, man, if you find them okay,  DO NOT MARRY THEM, I DON'T CARE WHO THEY ARE OR WHAT THEY DO. YOU DON'T WIFE THEM. IN THE LONG RUN, THEY WILL BREAK YOU AND DESTROY EVERYTHING YOU BUILD UP, DON'T DO IT. AND REMEMBER THE STD'S.<br>  2. Always asking you to spend money on her, I mean expensive items, dinner, etc, and not willing to split the cost with you, willing to spend your money without any second thoughts.<br>  3. Men friends, he only a friend, if you fall for that, I have beachfront property on the sun, if you're not the only man in her life, outside of her father, (family) she is gonna have a side piece,  too many men are out there raising kids that is not theirs, over 30% of married men are raising a kid that they don't know that it is not his, remember that over 30%, and once you find out it's late,  and she is gone with over have of your possessions and the kids. and she not gonna give a dam. <br>  4. High body count, They will lie about it, or they don't see anything wrong with it, Most women don't grow out of this, and most will miss it, When she getting down with you she may have so many guys she is thinking about when she with you, no matter what you do, there is gonna be someone that it reminds her of. that doesn't make you special, you're just one of many.<br>  5. If you have any standards, they will say you are controlling, <br>  6. she a feminist,  run away, and she sees you as someone to dominate use, and abuse.<br>  7. If she is from the streets, if a woman that you just met, offers to sleep with you, believe me, you're not the first one or the last one she wants to do this to.  So hit it, but don't fall in love with it, it's not worth it. and could have STD, SO THINK ABOUT IF IT is WORTH THE CHANCE YOU're TAKING.<br>  8. She was not raised by a father<br>  9. Her mother is the type that thinks that a woman doesn't need a man.<br>  10. She has a degree, that will automatically make her think that she <br>is superior to you, and will throw that at you, she will use it against you. and her friends will always cut you down, telling her she deserves better.<br>  11. She makes more than you, your money is her money and her money is her money. you know the rest.<br>  12. She hides her phone, or has a second phone, and doesn't let you access it. always hiding things, and not open about her activities. <br>  13. She has kids, kids with different fathers, she will let you be the supplier of material things for the kids but not be able to input what the kids are taught, and how they are disciplined. you will have no rights over the kids. But if the woman is a widow who has kids, and the husband died of natural causes, except in a street fight with his gang friends. be very careful, the law is against you, the mother can and will make you pay support to the kids if you get too involved with them, so beware, the kid is not yours, and you most likely not be recognized or get the respect the kids love. they are to be taken on a case-by-case basis.<br>  14. She doesn't take care of herself, she is lazy<br>  15. She doesn't cook. or clean the home you are living in. You're working and she's not but expects you to clean and cook when you get home from work, and to take care of your every need when you get home from work. <br>  16. She doesn't respect you, or treat you like a man who needs to be treated, she sees you as someone to take advantage of until someone she thinks is better than you Come along, you are just someone she is using until she accomplishes her main goal.<br>  17. She is a liar if you can't trust anything she says. if she lies once, she most likely has lied to you before and will continue to lie to you, once trust is lost, it can never be totally regained.<br>  18. She dresses like she is showing off her assets for all men to see, even if you have been with her for a long time.<br>  19. You work with her, this is dangerous, if you meet someone at work, one of you must leave, because if things don't work out between you and her, she can make the job a living hell for you and get you fired. <br>  20. body weight, I don't have to say much on his one, I have a rule, if I can't carry her out of a burning building, to save her and my life, I can't date her. <br>  21. They think too highly of themselves<br>  22. They don't have an ounce of modesty.<br>  23. Stop being a simp, have high standards, and marry a woman with class, loyalty, honesty, devotion, <br>  24.  ""Haven't gone through the sIoot phase and have friends who are still in the sIoot phase"".<br>  25. TATTOOS<br>  26. believe the man is there to serve her."

That man wasn't attacked by a furry. That man was attacked by a wolf. Ain't no law against killing a wolf that's attacking you.
Lololol. That guy. Oh my God. Crying worse than a baby while recording himself. Remember when it was embarrassing to everyone to act that way? What you do when someone cracks you with a megaphone is fighting back. You may die....you are being attacked. <br>Maybe this guy tried the possum technique
Sorry but the religious guy started to get to excited and that just turns people off and yes no different than the rainbow crowd barking or screaming over people.

"Bill Maher is actually anti-woke when it comes to the alphabet people pushing their ""values"" on kids. Yes, he's on the left, but has more of classical liberal in his values.<br>I am totally Conservative Christian and I have to be honest about what I've seen Bill Maher stand up against. I would have to see the whole episode as to why Bill was telling these girls how they might end up seeing pron while browsing the internet, and what would they do if they DID have pron show up on their browsers.<br>As we saw, she said she'd close it out real fast and he agreed. He did not say, ""Go ask your teacher what this is about"".<br>We have to be honest, even if it's someone we do not like. We cannot take that short clip of Bill and automatically go to ""he's brooming"" them without seeing everything in context. I repeat, Bill Maher is anti-alphabet group targeting the young.<br>Okay, I paused your video and found the Bill Maher show (it's a podcast). The girls brought up how they learned during covid lockdowns. They brought up how they would search the internet for what they were interested in. Bill warns them about accidentally searching for something educations (like weather), then ""storms"", then ""Stormy Daniels"", and then adult content. The girls said they already have accidentally found that. Bill was not teaching them how to find pron.<br>So, although that podcast was more trying to get the kids to hate Trump, Bill was not trying to lead them down the rabbit hole toward adult content. He had told them they really have to be careful of what they click on. That's all that part of the clip was about.<br>I think it unfair to label him as a pred toward kids based off everything he's spoken about in the past as well as that ten second clip you showed. I highly doubt Bill is brooming kids here."

I'm not saying these people are having that conversation is a reasonable manner, but the conversation with the parents needs to happen earlier than those before the Internet Age."

Well, she’s in 2nd grade now, and I look back at the past couple years and thank god my wife is smarter than me, because the school system in California is so Woke and disturbed, and my daughter is so much better for not being exposed the nonsense. She reads at an 8th grade level, uses words some adults don’t even use, and is complete girl boss. Homeschooling is the only sane alternative these days!"
When you look like a character out of Animal Farm than no man is going to chase you.
I know I'm not the smartest but what the hell is a furry
Breaking news the furry are not a psy op 😊
That was a really good meme impression 😂

What's sad is I'd prefer a tomboy over a girly girl everyday.. ain't nothin sexier than a girl that can snag fish and can out shoot me!!
It really makes me sick to my stomach as a man to see boys be weak and I didn't say men for a reason I don't care how old you are.

Which is the best action since furries tend to not interact unless interacted with. Unfortunately the kid did a typical reaction to something they couldn’t understand and express, it’s like all the kids that cry and get scared when they meet Santa at the mall. 😅"
Bill Maher is a creep. Never saw this clip.
That kid begging for a gf comes from a single mother household god damn hope someone is keeping an eye on that kid bc hes going to delete himself in the futer

"I love how you do the ""Brother ewwwwww' thing, its so funny and cool."
I have not been to a pride parade but my mom has and she said that it is the most gross thing she’s ever been to. Grown men and grown women expose themselves to kids

That’s how you know church’s are just a business.
"I need to search for more of these ""Not"" PsyOp news broadcasts"
"I'm like halfway through, but this is so painful. Why did you do this to me Griffin?"
Bill Maher is a dirt bag. And as innocent as that video seemed. Those kids nvr heard of stormy Daniel’s until he said something. I’d bet money that as soon as those kids have a cell phone they’re gonna look up who that weird guy they spoke to on TV was talking about.
This channel is great. I just found it. New Sub. Thank you bro
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=697"">11:37</a> I'm a furry and even I'm not wild enough to go out in a costume."
"I'm not sure how the person in the first clip meant to make their point. If they meant that they demand people obtain their consent before talking to them, good luck, because that's never going to be the norm.<br><br>However, asking someone if they're in a good place for having a tough conversation before launching into the subject is like a miraculous life hack. No matter what the topic is, it gives the other person a moment to prepare themselves to hear things that might be hard to hear. It will make them feel respected. Maybe they have things going on where now is not a good time for a hard conversation, and you can negotiate with them to set a time when it will be better. <br><br>If we want to just vent our frustrations regardless of how the other person feels, then feel free to ignore this advice. But if we want to have productive conversations that may actually solve problems, starting off by asking for permission to proceed sets everyone up for success there."
its okay to be a tomboy
WTH is a psyop 💀
She took her no-teeth skills to the next level.
When the majority of the world is about straightness. the minority needs to understand they can have their little community but don't bother us with it. This is our straight world society you are the terrible one forcing it on us. A thousand years ago you would of been killed off or shunned but today we just have to keep you away with a 10 foot stick and try not to trigger you.
not all furries are like that i have to say but a not are soooo idk
"Furry season is year round, no tag needed no limit."

Children are open minded which is why Bullying doesn't exist.

Taylor Swift is not a Psy op. That leads me to believe Taylor Swift is in fact a psy op.
"The demons have been released from hell, and infected the woke feminists."
"I'd like to move out of the west, but there is no other country with the level of freedom, liberty & God given rights that we have in America."

Not only do richer people commit less crimes (they mostly don`t need to and have more to loose), but also, having more wealth (and conections) helps a lot when going away with a crime.......<br><br>If you check it you will see how MOST of the black people convicted are also POOR, fatherless, and not all to educated........not that they shouldn`t face the consequence of their actions, but we have to aknowledge that they had bad cards from the begining....."

"I recently walked out of a doctors office cause they asked me my pronouns. I'm sorry, but if you can't tell what genders in front of you,  you shouldn't be a doctor. 😮"

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=280"">4:40</a> To be fair, if you are going to allow your children to access the internet, you should speak to them about this kind of stuff (in an age-apropiated manner), the same way tou should advice them not to accept candys from strangers or go into their van........<br><br>If they are going to browse the net, they should know about *orn, onlyfools, fake news, people lying and exagerating, they should learn not share personal information. They should know that the sweet 14 year old scoccer player asking for a risky photo is is actually a 35 yo *edo, who is going to blackmail them into a rabithole of degeneracy and abuse.<br>They should know that EVERYTHING they share on social media IS GOING TO BE THERE FOREVER.<br><br>Would you let your child navigate in a boat without proper training an knowdlege?"

Eeeeewwww... Brother eeeeewwww!!!!!
"Hey Griffin, you talk alot about leaving the west, so I was curious where did you move? which country?"
It's easy to poop everywhere when you constantly wear an adult diaper!
The context for the furry beat down just makes it even more confusing 💀🤣
My old dog DID get shot in the eye with a BBQ gun. He had to get his eye removed 😢 I miss my buddy
I love how the kid said he's not there to debate Charlie because he didn't want to platform him. Millions will see what this soy boy had to say because Charlie gave him that opportunity. I'm 100% sure Charlie Kirk has a large enough platform without the three people who even know who this little beta boy is. Which is probably his boyfriend and his two moms
Rule number one.<br>Always remember that furries are cringe
"A lot of pdffiles around, not good"
Sooo.... Taylor Swift is a Psy Op huh.... weird....
Mickey mouse got assaulted?....
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=600"">10:00</a> I don't agree with you on that one. Fresh and Fit are 2 rednecks in disguise, I would laugh in their faces too if they told me they get to do whatever they want while I have to stay faithful to some wetwipe."

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=609"">10:09</a> The thing about a lot of those women though, is that they'll end up with 6 kids and all those kids will have different dads."

Sometimes YouTube makes me RAGE at not being able to understand what is being said. He did WHAT with his grandma's implants? I have played it about ten times and can not understand it. Subtitles go gaga over the one word and I have played it .5x speed and still have no idea coupled with why would he have her implants if they aren't in her body? A cremation would destroy them so what the oh my goodness is going on here and why did it make you age twenty years? It honestly has made me Raaaaage trying to understand this.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaDtcfc-LE&t=16"">0:16</a> That is Andy Milonakis right there! Sad part is I wasn't sure if he was being serious or doing a skit, so I went with skit."
I can’t watch this anymore. It’s too sad to think that this is the direction we are headed.

"I have a vision that one day the left will look in the mirror and ask themselves, ""what the hell I have I become?"" I digress, they will double down on ugly."
Yes thank you that are psyopped the left are a massive psyop. I have been saying this for a few months now and you are the first person I have seen saying it.
brotha ewww
"What is the name of bill maher’s production company? It is called ‘Kid Love Productions”. But I’m sure that doesn’t mean anything, right? They wouldn’t just come out and tell us how evil they are, right? Unless it was like part of their secret evil religion to tell us all of the awful things they do, or something silly like that. I’m sure it’s nothing."
"I've referred to my 3yo niece as a baby before. Every time she responds with, ""No, I'm not a baby. I'm a big girl now."" Toddlers smart enough to know the difference."
The sheep brothers.
"Where was the parents to comfort that child, oh they probably left the kids there and went across street with camera to film poor scared child."
"Birth rates are dropping, That´s the plan."
Just a friendly reminder that Bill Maher owned a company named Kid Love Production
America has lost the plot. Leaders of the Clown World.
I love the angel Moroni.
"Thats actually not an irresponsible conversation to have with YOUR child, but I mean i feel like we are missing context here.  You should be talking to your kids about these things it happens earlier because of technology and if you don't someone else is going to."
So its confusing propaganda with solidaritiy?
is there a uncensored version?
"Dang...he was too annoying even for furries, now thats impressive"
"Maher is a creep, wtf was that!"
No wife happy life

the only part of this video i disagree with is the jiu jitsu clip. men and women roll with each other very often. my daughter rolls with boys in her age group and she can crush most of them despite being smaller than them. BJJ is designed for self defense and a main point of girls/women training BJJ is to defend themself against a boy/man.

Furry on Furry violence!
"The first one makes sense, kind of. Like, ""Hey, I've been going through something, is it alright if I talk to you about it?"" Not this whole, ""Do I have your consent?"" Just have a normal conversation"
"Memes aside, I really encourage you to watch Mohammad hoblus' lecture about real men. It is not so much about dawah [Islam preaching] as it is a real lecture that every man should watch and learn from."
I remember growing up and learning the difference between acceptance and tolerance when it came to social justice type stuff. One requires the other to agree & change while the other makes space for both stances neither person being required to change. I miss those days.
I’d NEVER WALK THE GRASS of a PRIDEFUL Church! 🤮

The mainstream media is a psyop! Repeated adinfinitum!
"Not surprised about Billy boy, early life history pattern recognition."
"Furry is NOT woke. Every time you bring up furries in your content, you show how narrow minded you are and totally unaccepting of anything that YOU do not agree with. Your showing you are just as bad as the leftist people. I have seen a lot of furries that are completely cringe as hell, but that doesn't make them woke or anything close to the BS you try to push. Always disappointing how badly you can bring your own content down when you start acting exactly like the people you are making fun of..."

The kid at the end doesn't need to have been home schooled. This is something that comes naturally to children. They only start saying otherwise when someone injects that idea into their minds.
The cool thing about fat acceptance is it ironically helps thin the population
That Bill Maher clip is so damn disturbing first of all if you're a f*<b>***</b> parent and you let your kids on any sort of device and you haven't put parental controls on it you have failed as a parent

I can't stand my brother by blood. Nor do I know his kids. But one thing they aren't woke propaganda kids.<br>Point is the wrestling video. My ig nephew began wrestling in school.  They matched him against a Lil high-school girl.  He wouldn't wrestle her and declared the defeat. People were actually happy for her win. He took the loss. It kinda blew his motivation to rank. Idk. Sodom and Gomorrah.  It always came full circle in history.
yes brother ewwwww
I had time understanding how that dude could cry hysterically over not all that much. Then they explained he was a furry who got denied and it suddenly made perfect sense 🤣
"everyone copying Blair White's ""fat people died"" video"

If you are dressing up like animals to play with your friends is nuts the mental health issues in this country are pretty bad is there any morals or values left in these idiots wow. As far as bill if you ever said anything like that to my kids your going to have a problem
NONE of this crap would exist if there WASN'T any social media......just sayin'............
"Bill Maher has slowly been moving to the middle, the farther the left goes, the more he moves to the middle.

She striked me as a single mother and I was like why do you allow this to happend, but most of all I was horrified. I seen it only on internet from you western guys and this was first time I saw it IRL in my general location. Not even eastern europe is safe from this woke virus.

"I actually do appreciate someone letting me know when they want to discuss something heavy instead of just lobbing it at me unexpected. It lets me get into the right headspace or let them know that I'm not available right now for whatever reason and to do it later. Really, I appreciate it when someone asks ""hey, got a minute?"" or something to that equivalent before getting into it with whatever subject they want to address. This has nothing to do with trauma or anything and is more about respect for each other."

Taylor who?
The sad thing about that girl on the podcast talking about how much she takes plan b is that other young girls are going to see that and think because shes seemed fine in that video that its ok for them to do it to and the crazy thing is shes proud and laughing about it... imagine how stupid shes gonna feel when she has some sort of physical repercussion from doing that
2 brain cells fighting for 3rd place is the best way to describe these clips.
So Taylor Swift is a psych op.
Only time ive kneeled was for my fallen troops
"Woke people all have a look that is a tell. You know exactly what I mean. It's a common trait, weakness, defeatism and self victimization as well as an angry and begrudging acceptance of what they see as global or universal victimization. They all look like they are being abused and the likely culprit in every case is them. I don't spend my days hating on people but something is endlessly frustrating about this crowd. Not one of them has ever even begun to realize their real power instead they are all about dragging all of us into their own self involved sub realities based upon their weaknesses. I'm sorry but the time to cut the chord never doesn't arrive. Wokeness is an extension of very wrong and very childlike assumptions that those of low mental capacity seem to absorb through the open air. Let's bring some independence, some adultness, and some hope for a better future into this next election. Not one of us, no matter our differences, is going sit comfortably over the next 10 years of life knowing that we didn't do so."
OHHHHH MY GOD taylor swift IS A PHUKING PSY-OPpppp😳

They paid a terrible enough price for the mass psychosis of the day, when merely moderate behavior, or even the perception of such, already appeared to be a crime. But the twentieth century has done especially much to tarnish the romantic luster of revolution which still prevailed in the eighteenth century. As half-centuries and centuries have passed, people have learned from their own misfortunes that revolutions demolish the organic structures of society, disrupt the natural flow of life, destroy the best elements of the population and give free rein to the worst; that a revolution never brings prosperity to a nation, but benefits only a few shameless opportunists, while to the country as a whole it heralds countless deaths, widespread impoverishment, and, in the gravest cases, a long-lasting degeneration of the people.""-Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn"
They have been saying we are coming for your children and now parents are delivering them via their marches.

"Truth and nothing but the truth. Amen.<br><br>Too bad this philosophy (anti-woke) is a minority in my country, because I totally agree with Griffin. <br>You see here (the Netherlands) that libelalism has taking a manifestation of all our eductions, my generation and the one following, etc. It saddens me to see that we are way to busy to listen how to adress a man and a woman and that we are not even allowed to call them that. <br><br>Where has basic knowledge gone to? Why do we listen to woke minority so much? Why am lectured by my own government about acceptance and liberalism?

"Strong women are not inherently bad. Me and my wife have 4 kids. When my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer 10 years ago she continued to work, care for our kids and kept a stiff upper lip for them. When it was just me and her she could be small, weak and scared. When they took her right breast she was strong again and showed me the result even though she was afraid I'd leave her but we kept going."

Ur allowed to go to restaurants with a bad mood
A teacher should definitely be mature enough to walk away from the group of rowdy kids.
Was that woman arrested for having a gun and threatening to punch which she did hit first
"You snowflakes need to know when a person is a Karen or just voicing genuine concerns, like the woman in the Cinema is not a f&#39;in Karen, they damn well should have put age ratings on the poster!"
At least the last Karen admitted her lies
"the worker at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqhgG2ImHLE&amp;t=765"">12:45</a> talked to those customers like how i wanted to talk to my customers at wingstop when i was 18 lmao. i was assaulted multiple times, threatened, pushed, name-called, etc, etc. i was an easy target cuz i’m 5’4 n petite. there was a gym near the wingstop i worked at n those gym bros were the worst. they would puff out their chest n get in my face. i was a people pleaser until 2 months in when i got used to the job n knew everything. the amount of times i had to call up my dad bc sb spit in my face or threatened to fight me or made me feel uncomfortable when i was closing, was actually astonishing. my dad only had to threaten sb life once bc this guy was making inappropriate remarks to his friends in spanish abt me in front of my dad. he was basically saying that my dads a joke n he is going to “still” wait for me in the back parking lot insinuating that he’s going to SA me, pretty much. my dad knew exactly what he was saying n asked him what vehicle he drives. he told my dad like an idiot. went to the front, took a pic of his license plate, went back inside n told him, in spanish, that if he sees his vehicle in the back parking lot, he is going to kill him. he was not in the back parking lot when i got out 😅 n my dad waited til i got off n then followed me home. she stood on all ten, tho. u could tell she was rlly bout that n as she should. if ur threatening a woman, especially in fast food, expect some heat back. respect 🫡"

So like the jersey mikes one was intense….so much anger about a sandwich
Airplane Abbey was hilarious and the Flower pot patty shlda defended herself!!
On the second video why do this idiot even bother recording when he misses the fight please to all of you recording if you don’t have enough since to to keep the camera on what’s happening then don’t bother because it make you look incompetent makes you look like a moron someone they can’t just point and shoot the camera as easy as that someone they can’t speak and record at the same time someone can’t walk and chew gum at the same time please don’t record anything if you can do that just make yourself look like an idiot
Equal rights equal fights she would be wearing that skateboard
the most impressive moment was the last word of the video when she said &quot; yea&quot; and smiled.

"Teresa Romansky, 35, was charged with one count each of disturbing the peace and wrongs to minors, according to Denver County Court records. She has a hearing scheduled on October 2, at which point she will enter a plea.  There is a very large chance she will get away clean.  Can you believe she pressed charges on the 11 year old (Charleston) for throwing her water bottle in the river after she threw his skateboard, which was instantly dropped."
"I hate people having their cameras out, but are filming the wrong way.."
"The woman who threw the skateboard is Teresa Romansky.  Police were called, they called the child&#39;s (Charleston Davidson) mother and the police mentioned the skateboard and not the physical attacks the woman caused.  Witnesses say she was intoxicated.   They are pursuing pressing charges now.  Not sure why the police didn&#39;t mention the assaults on minors to the mother.  People in Denver came together and got young Charleston new skateboards, shoes and other gear and even held a skateboarding event in his name."

She screamed at kids for walking through &quot;our property&quot;, told neighbors they were doing everything wrong, nitpicked anything that I or any nieghbor did to the windows or outsides of our houses. 2 neighbors who lived next to her moved out bc of her. She was such a horrible person to have as a neighbor. For 7 years I put up with her. Last year she died of cancer. And I keep thinking all that hate and anger is what did her in. And everyone is so relieved she&#39;s gone. How sad is that, to have people relieved that your dead."

Terrible song. I couldn&#39;t watch.
The big large  woman at KC : “ cannot be Fattisfried”. LOL
world gone to hell .. everyone is so tight Nit grouped .. no help no love :(
Im all for men helping women who get assaulted but defending a drunk woman with a filthy mouth who assaulted the guys first is a BIG NO NO FOR ME. If you put hands on someone first then get ready for the come back.
I hate to watch unhappy people
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvSvMeZvvg0&amp;t=497"">8:17</a> watched this far, and no knock outs yet, as for karma nope just allot of talking, where I would have sent em to the hospital 😒"

IS THAT A HOBBIT?
I had to stop watching 13 minutes in... the cheesy music competing with the people talking
Wtf😂
Is it me...or was the guy in the burgundy car skipping when he got out and came towards the car that was filming?
The blonde in the green dress is clearly diluted.
The guy in the whiye truck clearly tried to hit the motorcyclist.
Shouldn&#39;t there a solid line going around the curve? I&#39;ve never seen dash lines in a curve before. That&#39;s stupid.
She should have taken that woman aside and not deal with her in the public.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvSvMeZvvg0&amp;t=1550"">25:50</a> the police officer is in the wrong, not the Jeep"
The builders on the roof looked like it was staged.
That prank to not spot the dude lifting was NOT funny….. also can’t believe dude died over trying to throw trash from his balcony.
That woman that arguing with the child was a very stupid childish ignorant person
I can&#39;t believe the cursing and swearing. It is appalling!
Can’t fix stupid 😂
Thank you ❤ ( BIG CARMA MANAGER )  BAHRAM FROM TEHRAN &quot; ) .

She was drunk / they had to keep cool &quot; they had to Respect  her &quot;
The Seller said im Sorry / She had to come down  &quot;
It&#39;s always a woman yelling an bitching
Would of been better if you clickbaiters included the aftermaths..
Knocking out someone over words thus proves that person correct for calling you it in the first place~
These are a bunch of old ones.

What was the musical clip of liverpool all about? Nothing happened just played cowboy music?! Please let me know!
I think <b>ALL</b> of THESE people <b>NEED</b> to <b>GO BACK</b> TO SCHOOL and <b>LEARN</b> HOW to behave in public.
Did that man on the balcony’s head just explode like a watermelon when he hit the ground?!? <br>    I’ll check just once more. <br>          YARFFF.
I had to quit the video after the second one was complaining. I can&#39;t stand listening to all that. Lol...

"OMG<br>at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvSvMeZvvg0&amp;t=855"">14:15</a> that guy&#39;s head exploded! 😲"
The sea cow at KFC probably shouldn&#39;t have been there in the first place.  No doubt she must snort lard.
Wow all these people being so negative over the slightest things they must really hate their life whoever and doctor needed them sad these people need serious help
I bet the same guy wouldn&#39;t have said a word to a black man.

"At 1611, that girl is known for going up to people and starting crap with them and I guarantee you that guy finally had enough but yet he’s known as the “Karen” and that’s not right that is the piece of crap in the video"

"In the first guy&#39;s defence, I would be pissed if someone smashed a hammer on my car, regardless if I was composed or not."
Watch mojo has gone downhill. Its giving AI generated shorts vibes
I don’t understand why you don’t show more of the actual video

"Wait, let me understand this. A Karen felt an outfit was inappropriate, so she proceeded to strip the girl in public?"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFBnvcDh4Ao&amp;t=65"">1:05</a> - Wait, who are we suppose to be rooting for here? Guy was a dick for throwing coffee, but when vandalism is the retaliation…"
You know they show so many white people being racist but there&#39;s alot of bl*ck people that are racist too and for some reason they never show it. Imagine that <br>🤨🙄🫢
It’s insane how many people think they can assault/abuse people when they don’t get their way!
A moment of silence for nice women in the world you might as well keep making a heap of noise... those kind of women are like hen&#39;s teeth....
"The most vile, most disgusting creature that exists in this life today is women. Women today are so grossly masculine with bad vile attitudes that I literally just can&#39;t understand how any man can find today&#39;s women attractive.."
Why did you cut the part where the guy takes him down at Subway retards
2020 hands down
Why even show up to a business a few minutes before close. The employees want to go home not deal with last minute people.
&quot;Faced justice&quot;<br>&quot;She later apologized&quot; CLICKBAIT
The fashion police one be like: &quot;oh no! You are wearing inappropriate cloth. There are kids here&quot; (proceed to rip off the said inappropriate cloth infront of children)

"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. (Romans 10:13) <br>The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good. The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God. They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one. Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD. (Psalms 14:1-4)"
Coffee drive thru looks 100% staged
too much talk over
Someone must been the fashion police when they were in high school
why does this narrator talk so much
I like how Karen&#39;s always want their &quot;freedom of speech&quot; but don&#39;t want the responsibility that goes with that freedom!
we want to see the scene not hear your voice SOB!
Have you guys done a top 10 Florida Men?
Why are so many of these Karens lawyers or actually working in the legal field? Yikes 😬😬
"When I was growing up <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFBnvcDh4Ao&amp;t=304"">5:04</a> there was no leash law. Neighborhood dogs hung out, one chased cars(Molly), one swam uninvited in a neighbor’s pool (our dog) , but it brought the neighbors together! It was a reason to get to know them. I miss those days. What the hell happened??? 😢"

"There ARE no Races,. Our Evolution experienced a Bottleneck Event, as Supervolcano Toba erupted 70000 Years ago. Our Gene Pool is less diverse than that of two Chimpanzee Packs!"
I didn&#39;t see a victim in the first case only violence and toxicity.
"I visited a Subway here in Indianapolis, if you want to learn the subways that are owned from foreigners, Consumers beware ? My son and I visited an establishment that was owned by foreigners we ordered are usually and I was shocked on the price thought it was a little pricey from my past visit to a subway just days previous, so the next day I went to another location owned by 100% American and my son and I ordered exactly the same meals but from a different Subway, the Price for the same meals was almost $8.00 difference…So I investigated the foreigners will charge for single items instead of combo and they know what they are doing . I reported the dishonesty to Subway head office and I found that the subway that was dishonest was in trouble for leaving out items on a meal but over charging for them stealing from you ..If a 12 inch sandwich is supposed to have 10 tomatoes on it they would put half if you did not catch them leaving product off that was on you , the Office explained that the Subway franchise I visited was famous for dishonest practices, and Subway incorporated fined and put them on warning . After this happening I’ve caught several other companies owned by foreigners doing this dishonest practice…Since I exploited the Subway of corruption they have sold it and walked away ..I shared this story so others can be aware of this fraud businesses owned from foreigners are committing ❤"
"Wow.............can&#39;t believe society still calls sick women Karen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,is there any sympathy for the good women who are named Karen, who now feel ashamed to say their names.................Man society is dumb, fix one problem to create another?

"So, do we have a &quot;Queen Karen&quot; yet? Any ideas? The agony of choice."
That Lilly&#39;s a disgusting mess. Her twitter feed is full of racist BS.
My beautiful niece is called Karen a more polite non confrontational person you could ever meet💖
You don&#39;t have to be white to be racist. Every race has its racists.
your likes are 1%  of views.   Because we are sick of fake woke BS.  Go back to suking dik.
7.30.  This lady was 100% in the right.   Only gay liberals who get a boner when they think they can invent racism and get away with it.

My dogs when walked are ALWAYS on the lead.<br>Yanks are pruds.
The fiest one - I am still wondering if she was charge for the hammer attack
Narration sucks.
"A British woman in the U.S. telling someone they perceive as Chinese, to go back to their own country.  Oh, the irony!"
EVERYONE is disgusted by Karens!  AKA Blue hiared Crazy Cat Ladies.
Not when they use their platform to attack people? While they use their platform to attack people. 🙄🤔
"Never say black women but when it&#39;s a white women, then we gonna let everybody know about that."
"First guy in Washington state, said they reported him to the police...really....?....YOU PHUCKING DEFUNDED THE POLICE ASSHATS"
"That barista is no victim, she assaulted him with a hammer, which is a deadly weapon. That is a retaliation, not a self defence. And while wants a coffee out if her hands😂 I mean look at her🤮🤢she was most likely also charged for this too."
I aint about to mess with someone dealing with my food!!! HELL NAW!!!!
There should have been a Karen&#39;s club based in America only lol 😂😂😂😅😅😅
"Sadly, she HAD to use the hammer for any measure of justice since what the customer did is all but legal in Seattle now"
Being a racist is stupid and a waste of time These people have issues and displayed a very bad performance
"You&#39;re a bunch of cowardly HYPOCRITES just TOO SCARED to showcase the subject with UNENDING material and that&#39;s the somehow acceptable, ENCOURAGED, and even CELEBRATED HYPOCRITICAL- Racism, HYPOCRITICAL-HATE SPEECH, and the ABSOLUTE HYPOCRITICAL-STEREOTYPING of WHITE PEOPLE ALONE!  I guess it&#39;s ALL good unless the victims aren&#39;t WHITE!!!  ONLY THEN is it a problem you PUKES!"
"How&#39;s come you HYPOCRITES NEVER show the REAL RACISM going on in this country unchecked, unidentified, unaddressed, uncondemned, and damned well UNPUNISHED?!?!?!?!  It is MOST DEFINITELY the ACTUAL epidemic in this country of HYPOCRITES, and it&#39;s the free-for-all RAMPANT-RACISM against WHITE PEOPLE, you HYPOCRITICAL-COWARDS!!!!!"
"Good God! I wouldn&#39;t want anything served to me by a freak show, shit show like that either."
"The bikini coffee stand guy was in the wrong, but so was she for smashing his window. How is that considered self defense?"
"You didn’t show the subway takedown. And, I believe you need a new job."
Less commentary and more footage please
Karen-ness. lol
Not your best work Mojo
The video footage is minimal to non existent. Mostly A.I. commentary.
"Nature has a way of warning you not to F around, Wasp w sting-yellow, Poisonous Death Frog-orange, Bad Ass Barista with Hammer - tattoos on face.  #2 murder weapon of choice behind guns."
Are you going to show any of these incidents or just tell stories??
Why can’t people understand that freedom of speech does not mean you are also free from the repercussions of that freedom.
Give the dude a gift card .... Anytime you come in bullshit
Trad wife?? Shes not even married 🤣🤣
What slur did the trad wife use?
imagine freaking out cause you CAN&#39;T pay the 1.00!  huh?
Damaging someones property is not an appropriate reaction to making a mess.
"lousy video. all talk, no action."
I think the MAGA cult has destroyed society as we know it.  Anger and harassement are their ways of doig things in the age of the OrangeAnus.
MALE KAREN?  You su¢k. Especially your stupid narration
"Social media and most importantly their creators have decided to use the name “Karen” as an euphemism for the four letter “C***” word; although with two syllables Karen said fast can easily be heard as having one syllable and with the hard “K” and the hard “C” sound  these two similarities make the misogynists feel no shame in demeaning women this way; it’s PATHETIC that as a society we let our Late Loved Ones and our Living Grandmothers, Mothers,  Daughters and Sisters named Karen be abused in this way. Hey, the sheep must like this with all the thumbs up, with so many views and comments; lead them to the slaughter with hatred toward women upon their minds."
"Anyone else think the coffee thing was kinda &#39;eeeeeeh...&#39; Like if it had shattered or he drove off when she was still hanging onto the hammer, one or both could have been much more hurt. And either way guy could have easily sued n prossibly won. &#39;He threw some cold coffee at you so you attacked him with a hammer?&#39;"
Woah.
"It might have gotten worse with GOVERNMENT JABS!!!!!!!!  My brother retired military, always told me &quot; NEVER TRUST THE GOVERNMENT &quot;"
Reminds me of when I worked at a pet store and as we were closing up one night a dude came in (right as I went to go lock the door) we told him the store was closed and h proceeded to argue with us. 🙄
It always amazes me how willing people are to risk public shame and jail over mediocre at best fast food
"I love how they say this negative thing seems to happen in conservative circles but if I point out the progressive Trans people that have been found trying to groom and assault children that have been arrested and say that seem to happen in those circles, well now I&#39;m the asshole lol"
"So coffee thrown at a window = hammer? No, that one is messed up. That is not a matching of force. Fluid that had no risk of causing injury and didn&#39;t even make it in the store does not justify using DEADLY FORCE (hammers can kill) on a person&#39;s vehicle. Concerned for your safety? Yea right. I&#39;m concerned for anyone that knows you when you respond to anything with a fricking hammer. He is initially at fault but that went well past the appropriate response. Remind me to take out my firearm if someone spits on me, cause apparently thats ok."
Funny the Americans came here to California! In 1849😂😂 and they tried to bring slaves to California then californios told them we work for our own we don’t need slaves!😂
No body shouldn&#39;t look at your video why did you record it if you don&#39;t want any body to see it.
There is no need to show it if you going to mess the picture up.
I unsubscibed because of the wavy effect used to censor the fights. People wanna see fights. Not hear dumb narrating and deal with youtubes ever tightening censorship.
You need to find yourself another job because you’re waving the best part is stupid stupid stupid
If you gonna wave it wavy wavy wavy wavy your fights don’t bother posting anything else cause you’re wasting everybody’s time
"Bill Maher said it best, “When the media shows clips about racist Karen’s getting karma, they NEVER show black racists that get their asses checked. It’s only White, Asian, or Hispanic racists that get coverage, yet FBI crime stats indicate that black on White racist attacks are three times more than the other way around. That’s because the truth doesn’t fit their narrative.” He’s ABSOLUTELY right."
For the little girl in the shop that&#39;s crying you know they have ads on YouTube where you can make $180 an hour by being an actress but your act need some improving and that&#39;s my opinion like it or not really don&#39;t care but you have a good day anyway
Victoria’s Secret Karen should have been locked up.  In another video with more info cops just let her go and gave this woman a hard time.  Incredible.
These videos claim that Karen’s get knocked out cold when no such thing EVER happens and they blur the videos.  WASTE OF TIME!!!  Nothing but liars!!

For all of you moaning about blurs YT would shut this channel down otherwise 🙄🤦‍♂️
Those are some real sick ducks to encourage a fight with 2 year old crying and all they care about is hair pulling disgusting they done deserve kids 😮
"White people are trying to make KAREN a term that can define any woman! Wrong! Don’t even try it, it’s not gonna happen! KAREN is a slang term for a WHITE WOMAN perceived as entitled or demanding beyond the scope of what is normal. The term is often portrayed in memes depicting WHITE WOMEN who use their white privilege to demand their own way. Depictions include demanding to &quot;speak to the manager&quot;, being racist, or wearing a particular bob cut hairstyle. NO, THEY DON’T COME IN ALL RACES!"
Why would you confront someone with your child in your arms.
"Woman knows what she&#39;s doing. She got quiet when the doors opened, but started in again when doors shut."
Did she take the sandwich and want her money back?
"Politics is not a reason to lose a friendship. But then again if you can&#39;t accept each other, you&#39;re not friends. <br>Get the children away."
"Protect me, please. But not because of my behavior."

"It is the rare black that can speak English, it’s pure garbage"
"That woman on bus/train can’t speak,."
"Karens need to wear better outfits, if they are going to cause A disturbance."
Why are the trouble makers mainly black

Karens are specifically entitled ignorant whyte woman. That&#39;s why the name Karen. These are mostly like Rashidas or Taniqas.
Views and subscription = $$. The comment mean nothing.
Video is titled wrong. Bogus. False adversising BS. ... Reported
Morons!!! Why even share the video when you’re blurring it out !
"bullshit, dont waste your time"
Don&#39;t post anymore 😑 lol
Rotten video. The producer blurs out fight scenes as if the audience is juvenile and not mature enough to view them.
SUCKS
This wavy shit is annoying
You should put a trigger warning for the wavy effects on the video for people who have disabilities. That video trigger my  headaches and anxiety .

I apologize for saying ‘Aurora.’ Brain glitch.
More nominees for The Karen Awards!
The COVID-19 Karen was in denial and needed to be banned from the store!
The Irish dude didn&#39;t have any luck that evening once arrested...
"The second video took place at a fast food restaurant, not at a post office."
"Covid or no, if you cough on me like that, it&#39;s night night time"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIlRyerP-U&amp;t=1702"">28:22</a> she killed her by filming her"

Scumbag punching a horse!!!
"Karen at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIlRyerP-U&amp;t=1647"">27:27</a>  Seen that so many times in my lifetime"
Why the hell are the good bits blurred out???
Liar
"Scott Adams , right....again"
"You got your title Wrong, last 2 episodes i checked out barely if any, knock outs"
Sit down and relax? hahahah
Hate the &#39;click bait&#39; ... 6 videos in... NOBODY GOT KNOCKED OUT.... BYE...
Did you call African-Americans immigrants? if that&#39;s the case you would have to apply that then to everybody here in America.
&quot;not the old man. Oh Lord&quot; lol!!
Wait....is that Kayla??? 25.57 minutes in.
There’s a pretty consistent theme of women hitting men and not expecting to get hit back. You shouldn’t expect not to be hit!
"When he said, give me my money, I thought about that meme where it goes<br>JUst GivE mE mY mOnEY😂😂"

"Love that everyone is recording yet they can&#39;t call 911, &#39;merica!"
America. It’s full of sheeeeet
Stop blurring out the good parts 😡
I don’t understand why images are being censored
I hate it when ignorant people say that the police don’t need three people for one person- yes they do and it’s done to protect the person being arrested and the police officers involved in the arrest why should they go one on one? I bet if they did that wouldn’t be right either. Don’t pass judgement until you’ve walked in someone else’s shoes
Could do without the music playing over the talking
"People, the video only helps you when the cops are wrong; otherwise, you record evidence of your wrongdoing for the judge."

Gluttony is a sin Dunkin’ donuts 🍩 woman
You get it right the first time and pull not push the door
I’m English and I thought USPS stood for the United States Postal Service so why are they serving food there ? Or is it that someone has ballsed up the narration for this clip?
That was a great idea too sentence the Karen who threw food at a chipotle employee to work there for a month I hope she gets an understanding of how much work it is for little pay and no reward
At 12.22 how is he a Karen and there was no nee for the office to hit the man. head sould read instant Karma and Karen
"I grew up in a senisible,responsible world, what happened to it 😢🎉"
We living in a real Shakespearen play. Comedy and Tragedy
"Im a white Brit , and one thing above all on many of these clips is the willingness for many white Americans to be out and out racist right off the Bat , personally it&#39;s shocking to me and bothers me a lot . America really is a racist country which barely even tries to hide it ."
"The Karen @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuIlRyerP-U&amp;t=220"">3:40</a>, I screamed! Lady karma is a beautiful b*tch 😂😂😂"
Why the one third width videos?
why do you have to blur  the fight scenes?
Du 16/9pour les faux!
Did I click on the wrong video??? This isn’t Karen karma this is Karen’s doing whatever they want and walking away without consequences!!!! The fuck?
So far I don’t see no karma only Karens walking away Scott free
"2nd vid, workers were trying to steal her money."
"okay, first video, who is who? is the customer the violator or is it now she behind the counter enduring the wrath of yet another Karen?"
Maybe next video make the screen more small
And the stupid continues and these kind are in government. 😮
Im reayin disbelief how childish whyte people are
The dog park one cmon bruh dogs are like that it is in the nature it wasn&#39;t aggressive so shut up my dudes. The racist crap yes is bad but being Hispanic and dealing with it I still believe in the freedom of speech  words only have power if you let them .
And moral is if ur going throw dog poop at a cop make your is a German shepherd  not a pug.
"I like how there is no one who got knocked out cold, instead they just keep talking and yapping, stop clickbating lil bro."
"The customer is NOT always right, Blondie! Order it right the first time and be patient 😊"
"The nit wit whose dog is off leash and who pays taxes, she feels she is entitled to. What an idiot"
Erm…what the sigma?
Damn! The way i love ur videos 😭🤣🤣🔥i came here running when i saw the notification!
Why are you blurring videos? The whole point of a video is to be watched. Disliked and skipped.
That poor old mall cop. At least he tried right.
Blacks are racist. I noticed...<br>Why angry around where the food is...

"That piece of work screaming in the restaurant about how her kids don’t eat green things, they eat red things, should’ve taken a moment to listen to herself say that and maybe she’d hear how ridiculous it sounds to everyone else. She’s lucky I wasn’t in the store. I never let people yell at employees without stepping in to bark back at them. I CANT STAND BULLIES! We should ALL help each other out as much as we can. We need to come together to fix this world we’ve broken."

"What a 💩 show, this is sad it’s happening in “America”. <br>Under Biden this country has become 💩!!!"
Is this real😭

Biden really looks disoriented and dumb founded. I sure would hate to be in his shoes in front of millions of viewers!

"Ada indikasi zelensky menyelewengkan atau menikmati berbagai bantuan militer bersama-sama dengan biden untuk kepentingan pribadi mereka dengan mengorbankan rakyat dan tentara ukraina. Hal ini dapat dilihat dari  banyaknya bantuan militer yang dikerahkan keukraina yang pada akhirnya tidak menghasilkan apapun. Mereka hanya bisa memperlambat tentara rusia, namun tidak pernah ada hasil yang memuaskan bagi ukraina. olehnya itu kita semua patut menduga bahwa bantuan tersebut hanya sebagian yang sampai di Ukraina. Selain itu terlihat pula dari tingginya upaya teror dan penembakan terhadap lawan politiknya. Mungkinkah mereka takut diaudit...???"

Thou shall not kill babies in certain stages

"Что делать, чтобы наступил мир.

Это не свобода. <br>Это подчинение чужой воле.<br>Цветные революции в ряде стран постсоветского пространства устроенные США и их союзниками привели к нестабильности и разрушениям многих стран. Привели к разрушению мира и благополучия в этих странах, а так же к войнам, где погибли сотни тысяч человек. <br><br>Демократия дискредитировала себя созданием междоусобных прокси войн, свержением неугодных правительств, созданием религиозных расколов и религиозных войн среди христиан и мусульман, растлением нравственности и распространением идеологии гомосексуализма. Кроме того, конфликт Украины с Россией грозит перерасти в ядерную мировую войну.<br>Идёт поддержка демократами из ЕС, США, Англии с помощью оружия воюющей с Россией Украины. Именно демократы поджигают войну, которая не может закончиться из за их адского стремления наказать Россию и поделить её природные ресурсы. Из за зависти к России и ее богатству правителей европейских стран с США идёт сейчас война. Льется кровь невинных мирных людей. <br>Убивают десятки тысяч военных из за алчности политиков США, Англии, Германии, Франции, Италии, Польши, Румынии и т д.<br> Мир поставлен на колени благодаря кланам демократов, придумавших все эти безумные идеи, чтобы взять весь мир в свое единоличное правление. <br>Этому надо положить конец!<br><br>Даже если Россия победит, западные страны и США не смогут исправить свой фашистский звериный образ.  Нужно реабилитироваться. Не только в глазах всего мира, но и сменить ущербный курс приведший человечество к большим жертвам. <br>Демократия должна быть низложена и взят новый принцип на созидание мира во всем мире. <br>О мире перестали говорить, как будто ракеты не могу разрушить густонаселённых страны Европы и переполненные людьми города Америки. Это безумие!!! Демократы заигрались с огнём!<br>В США демократов лучше сменить на республиканцев, таким образом можно запустить освобождение от демократии во всем мире и поменять образ фашизма на реальную свободу для народов от диктатуры демократов. <br>Мир даст новые рабочие места, поднятие экономик стран, улучшение качества жизни людей и самое главное перемены в нравственности и образе жизни людей.<br>Мир должен стать  чище и лучше, без звериной сути демократической утопии обманувшей всё человечество. <br><br><br>What to do to bring peace.

"More fake debates, 2 puppets. Boycott the election!"
"thinking joe&#39; believes what he is saying,             just lazy old joe."
Modi cannot answer like them
"If you see both these debates back to back (Trump-Biden &amp; Trump-Harris), it is very clear that Trump put up the same performance in both. Just because Kamala didn&#39;t stutter and make faces like Biden did, she won over Trump!!?? Gimme a break, losers of low expectations!!"
"When Biden talks, I&#39;m straining to hear him . Trump speaks normally and on the other side there&#39;s sleepy Joe"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqG96G8YdcE&amp;t=200"">3:20</a> listen what  jew controlled said"
Lutus repeats what this old man says
"Without Biden&#39;s health problem, he is more presidential than Kamala. Very strong. They should not have moved him as they did."
where is the comment bout covid he skibided with
Debate be like :<br>Biden : 😦😴<br>Trump : 😏
I love when Trump looks over to Biden when he starts not making any sense and can’t put words together 😂😂😂😂
"Putting everything else aside, the golf tangent was crazy😂"
"That there are people out there that seriously supported Biden, no matter how dement he was, just shows us the state the western world is in. Litarelly erasing itself."
"Vote for Donald Trump? Absolutely,Yes! 💯 It&#39;s time to find America again!"
"Drink a shot everytime jaded joe says &quot;the idea&quot;. <br><br>I think everytime he has that glazed look on his face he is thinking about either his sun lounger on the beach, his bed or purple crayons."
"It’s not funny.. America was recognized as most powerful nation in the world, this current incompetent president proved that it is not. Now China has become more powerful than USA."
"I came here after watching president Trump vs vice president Kamala few days ago. <br>Here I can see, president Biden is trying to be very polite, but president Trump is being more aggressive and yes, maybe healthier. <br>I learn a lot from both debates, about how United States affecting the world and how what happening on this modern World, affecting United States."
This debate was much more productive than  competitive kamala ✨🙌
"330 Million people in the US and its really between these two Clowns to be president 🤡<br><br>I honesty feel sorry for Americans today, stay strong you guys!"
OMGGGGGG

"Let&#39;s all vote for Trump!!! He is the bright future of the USA and all the common people. Biden and Harris are a disgrace to the USA, which brought people to poverty and hunger!!!"
Brown William Williams Thomas Taylor Melissa
Who was Biden pointing at when he was entering lol
I never thought a presidential debate would be so funny
How can  VANZ keep on criticising KAMALA all the time? It is the administration he should criticise. Donald Trump will divide the country further
"Vance&#39;s interpretation of the abortion issue does not align with their actual stance on the matter. Vance succeeded in pouring a lot of sugar over their opinions, which I would warn all women against. Be careful! Not everything is as it seems!"
"Vance was amazing ❤, we’re watching a future American president"
Vance
Biden is just an I2ra3li puppet president
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
That Simone woman????  Love MSNBC BUT not her .. What is her problem was she looking for a fight ??? Geez !! The two were cordial - that was nice … they both made their points !! But Vance lost when he wouldn’t answer about Trump losing election wow !! Trump gonna be pissed cuz Vance didn’t say he won  but didn’t say he did either …😂😂😂😂Walz WON that debate for being HONEST - Vance tries selling lies … just like his cult leader …

<br>JD Vance sollte spätestens nach dem Duell selber gemerkt haben, dass er im Herzen ein Demokrat und nicht der Ekel Republikaner ist, den er in Trumps Nähe vorgibt zu sein, nur weil er über Trump jetzt die höchste Chance bekommen hat Vice zu werden... Schauen wir mal, wie lange Trump Spaß an seinem jetzigen Spielzeug JD Vance hat...

Vance clearly won the debate even though the garbage moderators were biased and wouldn&#39;t follow the rules.  Kudos to Vance for fact-checking the leftist media.  The Republicans should not agree to another debate with CBS or ABC due to the blatant bias.

"What people HONESTLY think about the 2024 presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Trump <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSeu2aWLjQ8"">https://youtu.be/xSeu2aWLjQ8?si=XNDHaNTZvpxBNmQj</a>"
What are &quot;Black Jobs &quot;?&quot;  Trump has refused to answer what he would do for childcare.  He also didn&#39;t answer the childcare question in his debate with Kamala.
"In two debates, I notice Trump refuses to answer how he is going to deport all the immigrants.  He changes the subject and goes on a rant."
I&#39;m a veteran. Total of about 5 years&#39; worth of combat. I have no help from the VA
"Two months later I finally watched this.<br><br>-It&#39;s so much easier to concentrate on what the candidates are saying when there&#39;s no distracting applause, cheering and jeering from an audience. In studio is a good format.<br><br>-If Biden (who was clearly nervous) had slowed down a bit, he might not have his lost of train of thought as he so embarrassingly did. His facial expression in the beginning even looked like that of a person who was tired and ill. However, his performance (and even the look on his face) did improve over the course of the debate. All in all, not bad for an 81 year old with a speech impediment, but he still made the right decision in no longer resisting the call to step aside. It was time.<br><br>- Trump just looking into the camera does work for him. He also proved he can resist taking the bait and no longer just blathers away even during an opponent&#39;s time. The annoying sniffing appears to be gone, too. Experience seems to have been a good teacher as this was not a bad performance. Still, Trump&#39;s assertion that the environment was well looked after during his administration is laughable, he doesn&#39;t say how he would negotiate a deal between Russia &amp; Ukraine, his addressing of the subject of The Proud Boys continues to be weak, as was his response regarding the January 6th riot.<br><br>In summation: Biden made the right move stepping aside, and Trump should&#39;ve done the same thing. No matter what their records indicate, these guys are both too old. <br>Next time let&#39;s see a match up between people who aren&#39;t past their prime."
Why does everyone call trump president???!<br>He’s NOT
"In short:<br>Trump: You are sucks<br>Biden: No, you are sucks"
Lies
"YEAH BIDEN, HANG YOUR HEAD LOW!"
"Finally ,trump finds his match 😂😂😂"
BIDEN LIED THROUGH THIS ENTIRE DEBATE 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
"I follow the predisential debate between Harris and Trump and see confirmation that it doesn&#39;t matter who the next POTUS is. They both grovel to the Israeli lobby. The only difference is that Harris is indeed dumber than Trump but has a more sympathetic face than Trump. And that will be the deciding factor for the US voters. As a Dutchman, I am only interested in the fact that the US is on the decline. And that is good for the world."

Trump is winer
"Biden acceptable, he won 💯 My friend Joe Biden a smart  politician, competence and action."
Trump is on point.  I know he won the election in 2020 but the Democrats DID NOT allow it.  They forgot to cheat in 2016 because they underestimated us and were overly confident in Hillary.  They will not let him win in 2024.
This was GREAT!! Trump looked so good. He performed well. <br>The upcoming debate when Trump will win be Harris will end up the same.
😢
lol
This CNN is siding with Biden
Biden can’t speak well ! He is eating the words
Biden like a robot
"It’s still legal to have plan B pill so no excuse for needing abortion these days , it should be last resort no used for contraception"
"God he looks old and ill, them silly faces he pulls are unprofessional, trump’s right the world is laughing at America and it’s Bidens fault. What about poor white people why don’t they get help to buy homes or free student loans it’s not fair and it causes racism"
More people died of Covid under Biden then Trump  look it up.

Vote vote for USA. Let’s make it great again he deserves the keys to the White House after the votes were rigged, which we need to pray this doesn’t happen ever again, they crooked the Democrats are possible that’s why they’re hiding in the seller at the White House how to do evil and cheat cheat and lie lie lie that’s why they don’t want the debate to go on open borders open prison cells dying in our country I mean, what’s 911 they’ll be putting rockets in our High tower buildings all over the country. If you don’t get Harris out of the White House, our country will be destroyed. It already is, but it will be worse than you can ever imagine. It’s important to vote.

"The two biggest lies she told — and it was difficult to choose because she said so many — are the one where she said police had been killed on January 6 and the “fine people” lie in Charlottesville. Both lies are demonstrably false. The fine people lie, which has been discredited for years and is documented on video, has also been thoroughly debunked by liberal Snopes."

"And sleepy joe does it again! Starts off strong, fast, good volume and just comes to a complete stop in the middle of a sentence and forget where he is. That’s some serious skills bro!<br>I remember watching him read off the teleprompter and he’ll say a line and on the screen he’s reading says repeat the line he’ll actually say repeat the line during the sentence.

"I love you Biden, even though I don&#39;t understand all of your economical language you are like a priest 🙏😺"
"Trump, you can just humiliate anybody right!!!!!!!<a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/2sIfY8vIG8z96ALulYDQDQ""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/2sIfY8vIG8z96ALulYDQDQ""></a><a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/2sIfY8vIG8z96ALulYDQDQ""></a>🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
i’m tempted to commit tax evasion.
I did not watch the debate  every bill  under him took the country backwards.
"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE bring on the Trump v Kamala debate. Dont deny us that treat.....it will be HILARIOUS. 🤣"
Why did you all let him come out like that? 😮
"If we stopped sending our money over seas for wars, we could pay for all of those things"
Watching from Papua New Guinea

"Hello, I am an American citizen and I would not vote for Trump, everything he says is false and a liar. which he hates migrants from all nations. and a wall will not solve the problem because God created this planet Earth and this earth is for all human beings, there should be no division in countries, in fact, they should support those countries that are going through economic difficulties and to close with this point, migrants do not They carry drugs because there are drugs everywhere in the world. And may peace reign in all of you and love your enemies love 🕊️🙏"

"Cringe all over, biden is the prime example of how the USA of burgerland is run by old mummies"

The american citizen should take to streets come out for gathering demostrations without peaceful no mercy against current president which is really old enough not qualify for seats order require for the president to resigns step down immediately after watching these
"Read analysis from the debate here: <a href=""https://on.wsj.com/47MyDkF"">https://on.wsj.com/47MyDkF</a>"
Senator Vance did so well.👏 Bravo.
These Walz lies are so deep
Finland&#39;s teachers are some of the best paid in the world.
"Why does walz look like a physcopath everytime he talks? It just makes me feel uneasy every single time, its strange or i guess i should say &quot;weird&quot; lol"
Great debate! I think these two gentlemen should be running for President. They would make a formidable team.
Can Vance run for president next time?
Does he know anything else besides Minnesota?  That&#39;s all I hear -
finally a successful debate based on arguments and not nonsense. congratulations to both candidates
"I think Vance dispelled a lot of the negativity that the opposition has drummed up in regard to his ability. He was incredibly well spoken, reasonable &amp; respectful. Great job."
"Still a 3 v 1, gotta love it"
"That&#39;s right, Harris already has an opportunity to make changes,  but didn&#39;t."
"Are you people insane? What was civil about JD Vance? He kept lying till the end. Its a disgrace. He supports a radikal, that wants to steal our freedom. He knows how to sound moderate, but he is not! Dont get distracted!"
"Tim,, how do you quote the bible then later on support killing Gods children? You know whom else quoted scripture to try to corrupt it? satan"
"Even if we build more houses, what&#39;s to stop the rich from buying them up too and continuing to treat property like a commodity?"
"Kamala lied when she said biden was fit for office, bidenomics works the borders are secure and when a judge ordered her to hand over excupatory evidence to defendants. <br><br>Waltz lied about his military record and affinity for China"
"Trump put the cap on insulin at $35, stop taking credit for what yoy didn&#39;t do. Thank you though, it shows  you agreed with Trump without coming out and saying it."
"Wall Street Journal is corrupt and evil.  Shame on these &quot;journalists&quot; for their evil deeds.  They push leftist evil agenda.  The Holy Lord God Almighty Jesus Christ is the truth and the truth shall set you free.  The wages of sin is death.  Lying is sin and pushing evil agenda,  not being fair and unbiased is evil.  Shame on the Wall Street Journal top management and all those whom took part."
"Im glad that the vice presidents seem a bit more tame than their running mates. Kamala, the infinite slogan repeater with a horrible track record, versus Donald Trump, the low key kinda crazy guy, but he&#39;s got good ideas, fights and just makes things work with a great track record. In no world am i voting for kamala, but if it would be waltz, it would atleast be a closer battle. In all honesty, both of the vice presidents seem like a better choice than their presidential counterparts 😂"
I&#39;m impressed with JD Vance and to be fair Tim was OK. Definitely better than Kamala.
Vance is 10 times the man Walz could ever hope to be. His whole family isn&#39;t even voting for him and kamala.
I trust a man with a shadow more than one without.
Serious YouTube? Four commercials every 10 minutes? You’re digging your own grave
Vance did an amazing job 🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🧹🪠🪠
America can&#39;t afford four more years of Harris
It’s impossible to claim there is “no widespread voter fraud” when we aren’t requiring ID or any other certification to vote. You can’t prove or disprove something when you aren’t gathering the information required to do so<br><br>Lack of proof does not prove nor disprove anything. You need proof to either prove or disprove
Harris wants middle class taxpayers to pay for health care and housing for unvetted migrants.<br><br>NYC already paid 5.5 billion on unvetted migrants
Yall notice how much they cut off Vance but always let wahlz finish his statement. So bias
It really comes down to who would you want to be your president in 4 years.
"Blaming inflation, housing, and everything under the sun on immigrants is infuriating when it&#39;s so obviously corporate greed at the root of those issues. <br><br>Housing isn&#39;t up because of immigration. It&#39;s up because it&#39;s viewed as an investment and as a result, corporations own the majority of US residential housing."
"Vance is future, listen to him"
"Illegal immigrants with no social security # are getting mortgages to buy $300,000+ houses.  Mmmhmmmm."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbKF3Qt9hg&amp;t=737"">12:17</a>"
Waltz so disgusting
This blind trust in so-called science is only possible because the population is so dumbed down they don&#39;t know that the &quot;science&quot; is paid by the government. That is like if you paid someone to say exactly what you want.
"Some bills are not paseed because of what is hidden in them. These laws need to be thoroughly looked at before looking at. Remember obama care, that was a mess. Nancy we won&#39;t know what&#39;s in it until we pass it, nonsense. Not how it works.😊"
We need Trump in office!
"Climate scientists are not scientist. If the existence of a job depends on a crisis being real, then you can&#39;t trust the guy who says there is a crisis. He will lose his job if there is no crisis."
The Best Debate Ever 🙌🏼  <br>Im Voting Republican  .
Vance has credited eyes.
"Ohh Vance is an opportunist, he wants VP, so he can be given Presidency. Ohh I can see it."
This debate was far better than Kamala and trump ; this actually are true politicians 2 diplomats statistical dudes really explaining what they are going to do for the country ! 😂😂 trump vs Kamala was more like children debate not even ……. I like both but I’ll vote for vence 🎉 this was more like a presidential debate !!
"Minnesota is one of the most child friendly states and Minnesota has an epidemic of children getting guns and shooting themselves? Of course, this from someone who says he has befriended school shooters."
Where is the help for young widows/widower and single parents with young kids. They can’t find jobs to work with them on getting a good balanced work schedule. It’s either you come in 6:00am or earlier in morning or you work nights. Where is the 9:00am to 5:00pm jobs that pays decent wage for these parents for they can work and take care of their families with one income?
"Wow, how refreshing!"
Just like they did to trump cut the mic  one sided
"Vance did a really, really great job. I can&#39;t believe anyone wouldn&#39;t vote for him after this."
"The notion that extreme weather is linked to warming is so absurd, it is quite baffling that anyone believes it. It shows how scientifically illiterate people are."
I love Vance!
Walz looks like his in amphetamine &quot;Vance Shread him to peaces &quot;
Can we please get a second presidential debate on CBS instead of MSNBC? This is how a debate is supposed to be conducted fair and tough questions for both candidates. Get Trump and Kamala on here and I think the country will be able to make a better decision. If CBS host a presidential debate.
"Ha ha ha, Vance won easily even in a 3vs1 situation. This man will inherit MAGA from Trump in 2028."
Why do the democrats consistently lie?
The moderators suck as usual!
Rainfall and hurricanes is a sign of global cooling. Any physicist knows that warming increases entropy and thereby minimizes temperature differences and therefore also the occurrence of tornados and hurricanes.
Amazing how all the commercials during this debate all bash Trump. Really necessary? Couldn’t have random product commercials? Oh wait- Merrill Lynch had a few and we know they are totally LEFT leaning. Otherwise great debate with the exception of cutting off Vance or using the - “We have a lot to cover” excuse.
Abortion is not healthcare.
Be a Kennedy Democrat- vote Trump!
Senator Vance - Donald Trump was willing to have his own vice president attacked by mob violence when the vice president refused to break his oath of office. What steps would you take to ensure your safety if your sworn constitutional duty conflicts with the president&#39;s whims?
"See how at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbKF3Qt9hg&amp;t=1830"">30:30</a> these two propagandists Commie true red color comes out. This is why this media is all fake media.  Is American Pravda. Zero credibility."
"Very civil debate, the President&#39;s themselves can learn a great deal from these two men in how to handle a debate. JD Vance has won this Debate, hands down. Trump will win this!  Election.  Vance will step in and take his place in the future. I hope alongside Vivek Ramaswamy. They would be an incredible team in the future to secure America&#39;s Strength."
Vance says the Cartel is using children as drug mules and one of the moderators tries to make it seem like he was accusing Kamala of using children as mules. Then she says nothing when corrected.
Conservatives are avoiding any question about Jan 6th like the PLAGUE.
"An excellent debate that has set a benchmark for future Presidential and VP debates. The sustained focus on issues, healthy acknowledgement of validity in the opponent&#39;s points, clear and meaningful attempt to respond to questions made it a very good debate. Both VP aspirants batted solidly and articulated the policies and positions of their respective captains much better than Harris or Trump could. Kudos to both Vance and Walz for that! While Vance showed a clear edge with his astute knowledge and oratory, Walz was on the back foot as his teammate is a cackling hyena and some of their policies are rather indefensible. Yet another positive was both moderators were mostly professional, unlike in the Presidential debate where Trump was debate a team of three!"
"Interesting how much happier people are when we only have one party. Two politicians who&#39;s interests align exactly for the political class and everyone is so happy about them being civil with each other. We should just stop having elections and let politicians decide who is in charge, by the youtube comments you&#39;d think that would make everyone a lot happier if they never had to confront anyone or work towards their own interests haha."
"Dear Americans. So many comments appreciating that these two had a &#39;normal&#39; debate. <br>I bet you could have had the same experience, if Vance would have debated Harris. <br>Now take a moment and think about it, WHO makes the debates and the presidential elections a clown show. <br>Anyway. Not my monkeys, Not my business. Wish you good luck !"
"I just hate when they say things  like Kamala has had 3.5 years to do what she wants. Actually Biden is president not Kamala. She doesn’t have the powers to do squat. Donald has already been president and had the opportunity and screwed up everything. Mike Pence was the biggest patsy because Vice president can’t override the president. She works for Joe Biden 😅 Hopefully she gets a chance to win, so she can show and prove herself."
Warning: There are a bunch of crypto bots in the comments spamming about XAI8-something which instantly all received 1k upvotes.
Walz has that Betamale high-pitch voice at the end of each sentence.<br>JD Vance has the voice of a real marine.
Sorry Vance but there no such thing as a “state viewpoint”.
Trump/Vance  2024 ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
"Both of these gentlemen behaved and presented themselves well<br><br>The VP should be working to elevate the Pres, I felt Vance did a better job of reinforcing the policies of Trump where Walz focus more on attacking Trump instead of elevating Harris"
Who else hates Hyundai after this debate?
Someone should have gotten these guys a room. 😂 cosied up to each other much
April 2024 there was the most recent school shooting in Finland .
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbKF3Qt9hg&amp;t=1829"">30:29</a>"
It&#39;s not HER administration; she&#39;s not in charge. How much autonomy does he think Trump is going to give him if elected?
Why are the moderators making their own points after the candidates are done making theirs?
"unbiased opinion from someone with no skin in the game; Vance&#39;s Yale experience was on show last night - he is a skilled debater.  I still feel we don&#39;t know the real Vance. he definitely holds conservative values but I genuinely don&#39;t believe him to be as extreme and evangelical as many of his colleagues including Mr Trump.  I am from a country where for too long the church and state were too closely connected and this has had dire consequences for the women and children of my country which are still being uncovered today; I fundamentally believe religion and religious beliefs are personal and should not be used to develop policy and laws - on both sides! I think Tim Walz is genuine, solid and a fundamentally a good person, not as articulate and sleek a debater as Vance but he stepped up and did a great job."
"I hope Trump wins because we need a populist and someone who isn’t an employee to the corrupt state but rather working for the American people first. With that said, it’s a breath of fresh air to have someone with his policies carry himself in away that the American people can all respect. This is why I wanted Vivek to win though that was never going to happen, many people can’t get past the way trump talks to actually focus on what he’s trying to do for the country."
"Funniest thing said award goes to Tim Waltz... He said he and VP Harris have firearms and hunt... He might hunt but Harris is not a hunter, she&#39;s a predator. Well, that and he said he was friends with school shooters..."
"We actually could indeed hear you JD - don’t worry. CBS did a poor job at trying to make you look bad. Millions of us are absolutely blown away by how you handled yourself today. Hands down, you killed it on stage today! Thank you for giving us real information and REAL ANSWERS"
Im living in Finland and there have been school shooting here too. <br>Now will Tim be factchecked  as he lied .
"“We’ve got to earn peoples trust back”, in Ohio Jd? Where your party had anti-abortion groups pen the abortion bill summary..   that lied and said the first issue 1 was to protect the will of the people..    f the GOP in Ohio."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbKF3Qt9hg&amp;t=1816"">30:16</a> Wow what an unbiased moderator"
First few sentences in by moderators and theyre already lying about the status of Iran&#39;s attack.on Israel.
"People forget that these folks are supposed to work for the PEOPLE, not the party.   This is a constitutional republic, not a democracy.  Hold these politicians accountable in NOV &#39;24, and fire the ones that are not representing you! GET OUT ADN VOTE"
It should have shown them walk in and greet each other. Small thing but it shows something I think.
"Reject sensorship? Trump wants to shut down media that doesn&#39;t agree with him and jail people who speak out against judges (excluding himself, obviously)"
Fair play to Vance for putting the moderators in their place
I would rather be voting between Vance and Walz than Trump and Harris 🥲
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbKF3Qt9hg&amp;t=3961"">1:06:01</a>"
It is the job of the president to be impartial and talk with different countries. Know the job before you speak
Just like the president debate it&#39;s just one sided on the Donald Trump that&#39;s crazy that they sit here and keep doing this
I like Vance and he did a good job overall. He’s smarter and more poised than the other 3 people on the ticket for sure. He failed on the abortion questions however. He allowed Walz to focus solely on abortion as it relates to life/health of the mother. There is no mainstream Pro-Life position that doesn’t believe in allowing abortion in certain dire circumstances. The issue is abortion as elective birth control which is what the vast majority of abortions are. It’s disappointing and even infuriating to me that there is currently no high ranking politician than can articulate a principled pro-life position.
He looks like an ancestor from the civil war <br>Handsome man !
"Once again, biased moderators...  One-sided and erroneous &quot;fact-checking&quot;; not providing even time to respond, Leading questions to Waltz (giving the answer in teh phrasing of the question)... really pitiful."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WbKF3Qt9hg&amp;t=1768"">29:28</a> So aggravating, her trying to dictate &quot;facts&quot; and not allowing Vance to comment"
Vance whines about how it&#39;s congress&#39;fault when he was in office. But Kamala should be getting stuff done without congress approval
Both of these guys know how to talk....but one of them is lying. At least they are actually debating the topics rather than name calling.

"What a 💩 show, this is sad it’s happening in “America”. <br>Under Biden this country has become 💩!!!"
Is this real😭
😢😢
Biden really looks disoriented and dumb founded. I sure would hate to be in his shoes in front of millions of viewers!

Is America even running America debate is a total L

Why is he whispering and rampling on?. He needs speech therapy.

"Ada indikasi zelensky menyelewengkan atau menikmati berbagai bantuan militer bersama-sama dengan biden untuk kepentingan pribadi mereka dengan mengorbankan rakyat dan tentara ukraina. Hal ini dapat dilihat dari  banyaknya bantuan militer yang dikerahkan keukraina yang pada akhirnya tidak menghasilkan apapun. Mereka hanya bisa memperlambat tentara rusia, namun tidak pernah ada hasil yang memuaskan bagi ukraina. olehnya itu kita semua patut menduga bahwa bantuan tersebut hanya sebagian yang sampai di Ukraina. Selain itu terlihat pula dari tingginya upaya teror dan penembakan terhadap lawan politiknya. Mungkinkah mereka takut diaudit...???"

Took a shot every time Joe Biden says &quot;and the idea&quot;
FAKE NEWS MSNBC said Crazy Joe won. 😊😂😂😂
Biden is old and becoming senile but he is so much smarter and responding to questions better than Kamala. At least he still know what he is talking about. 😂
Thank you Donald Trump for 4 years of no wars great economy stimulus checks safe borders
Thou shall not kill babies in certain stages
Donald Trump is right Biden &amp; Kamala are allowing in millions of immigrants are going to wipe out social security paying for all these  immigrants making crime rate through the roof no thank you Biden for destroying our country
The difference between Trump &amp; Biden is Trump has class
"Let&#39;s appreciate the oldest man, Biden. 💚"
why is this actually interesting to watch tho.. I am not the one to usually sit and watch these but i watched the whole thing loll

if he did exactly like this again with Harris. he would not have lost !!!!!!!!!!
"What to do to bring peace. A new idea for the global community. In order for peace to come on earth, Western countries, England and the United States need to rehabilitate themselves in the eyes of the world community. In addition, it is necessary to change the political course. Democracy has discredited itself. Everyone can already see that the promised freedom turned out to be a dictatorship, a means of forcing peoples to live within the framework that they have defined for people. This is not freedom. This is submission to someone else&#39;s will. The color revolutions in a number of post-Soviet countries, organized by the United States and its allies, led to instability and destruction in many countries. They led to the destruction of peace and prosperity in these countries, as well as to wars where hundreds of thousands of people died.<br><br>Democracy has discredited itself by creating internecine proxy wars, overthrowing undesirable governments, creating religious schisms and religious wars among Christians and Muslims, corrupting morality and spreading the ideology of homosexuality. In addition, Ukraine&#39;s conflict with Russia threatens to escalate into a nuclear world war.<br>Democrats from the EU, the USA, and England are supporting Ukraine, which is at war with Russia, with the help of weapons. It is the Democrats who are igniting a war that cannot end because of their infernal desire to punish Russia and divide its natural resources.

"Что делать, чтобы наступил мир. Новая идея для мирового сообщества.<br><br>Чтобы наступил мир на земле, западным странам, Англии и США надо реабилитироваться в глазах мировой общественности. <br>Кроме того  надо сменить политический курс.<br>Демократия дискредитировала себя. <br>Уже все видят, что обещанная свобода оказалась диктатурой, средством принуждения народов жить в тех рамках, которые определили для людей. Это не свобода. <br>Это подчинение чужой воле.<br>Цветные революции в ряде стран постсоветского пространства устроенные США и их союзниками привели к нестабильности и разрушениям многих стран. Привели к разрушению мира и благополучия в этих странах, а так же к войнам, где погибли сотни тысяч человек. <br><br>Демократия дискредитировала себя созданием междоусобных прокси войн, свержением неугодных правительств, созданием религиозных расколов и религиозных войн среди христиан и мусульман, растлением нравственности и распространением идеологии гомосексуализма. Кроме того, конфликт Украины с Россией грозит перерасти в ядерную мировую войну.<br>Идёт поддержка демократами из ЕС, США, Англии с помощью оружия воюющей с Россией Украины. Именно демократы поджигают войну, которая не может закончиться из за их адского стремления наказать Россию и поделить её природные ресурсы. Из за зависти к России и ее богатству правителей европейских стран с США идёт сейчас война. Льется кровь невинных мирных людей. <br>Убивают десятки тысяч военных из за алчности политиков США, Англии, Германии, Франции, Италии, Польши, Румынии и т д.<br> Мир поставлен на колени благодаря кланам демократов, придумавших все эти безумные идеи, чтобы взять весь мир в свое единоличное правление. <br>Этому надо положить конец!<br><br>Даже если Россия победит, западные страны и США не смогут исправить свой фашистский звериный образ.  Нужно реабилитироваться. Не только в глазах всего мира, но и сменить ущербный курс приведший человечество к большим жертвам. <br>Демократия должна быть низложена и взят новый принцип на созидание мира во всем мире. <br>О мире перестали говорить, как будто ракеты не могу разрушить густонаселённых страны Европы и переполненные людьми города Америки. Это безумие!!! Демократы заигрались с огнём!<br>В США демократов лучше сменить на республиканцев, таким образом можно запустить освобождение от демократии во всем мире и поменять образ фашизма на реальную свободу для народов от диктатуры демократов. <br>Мир даст новые рабочие места, поднятие экономик стран, улучшение качества жизни людей и самое главное перемены в нравственности и образе жизни людей.<br>Мир должен стать  чище и лучше, без звериной сути демократической утопии обманувшей всё человечество. <br><br><br>What to do to bring peace. A new idea for the global community. In order for peace to come on earth, Western countries, England and the United States need to rehabilitate themselves in the eyes of the world community. In addition, it is necessary to change the political course. Democracy has discredited itself. Everyone can already see that the promised freedom turned out to be a dictatorship, a means of forcing peoples to live within the framework that they have defined for people. This is not freedom. This is submission to someone else&#39;s will. The color revolutions in a number of post-Soviet countries, organized by the United States and its allies, led to instability and destruction in many countries. They led to the destruction of peace and prosperity in these countries, as well as to wars where hundreds of thousands of people died.<br><br>Democracy has discredited itself by creating internecine proxy wars, overthrowing undesirable governments, creating religious schisms and religious wars among Christians and Muslims, corrupting morality and spreading the ideology of homosexuality. In addition, Ukraine&#39;s conflict with Russia threatens to escalate into a nuclear world war.<br>Democrats from the EU, the USA, and England are supporting Ukraine, which is at war with Russia, with the help of weapons. It is the Democrats who are igniting a war that cannot end because of their infernal desire to punish Russia and divide its natural resources. Because of the envy of Russia and its wealth of the rulers of European countries, there is now a war with the United States. The blood of innocent civilians is being shed. <br>Tens of thousands of soldiers are being killed because of the greed of politicians in the United States, England, Germany, France, Italy, Poland, Romania, etc.<br> The world has been brought to its knees thanks to the clans of Democrats who came up with all these crazy ideas to take the whole world into their sole rule. <br>This must end!<br><br>Even if Russia wins, Western countries and the United States will not be able to correct their fascist bestial image. We need to rehabilitate ourselves. Not only in the eyes of the whole world, but also to change the flawed course that led humanity to great sacrifices. <br>Democracy must be overthrown and a new principle must be adopted to create world peace. <br>They stopped talking about peace, as if missiles could not destroy the densely populated countries of Europe and the crowded cities of America. This is crazy!!!

"If you see both these debates back to back (Trump-Biden &amp; Trump-Harris), it is very clear that Trump put up the same performance in both. Just because Kamala didn&#39;t stutter and make faces like Biden did, she won over Trump!!?? Gimme a break, losers of low expectations!!"

Lutus repeats what this old man says
"Without Biden&#39;s health problem, he is more presidential than Kamala. Very strong. They should not have moved him as they did."
where is the comment bout covid he skibided with
Debate be like :<br>Biden : 😦😴<br>Trump : 😏
I love when Trump looks over to Biden when he starts not making any sense and can’t put words together 😂😂😂😂
"Putting everything else aside, the golf tangent was crazy😂"
"That there are people out there that seriously supported Biden, no matter how dement he was, just shows us the state the western world is in. Litarelly erasing itself."
"Vote for Donald Trump? Absolutely,Yes! 💯 It&#39;s time to find America again!"
"Drink a shot everytime jaded joe says &quot;the idea&quot;. <br><br>I think everytime he has that glazed look on his face he is thinking about either his sun lounger on the beach, his bed or purple crayons."
"It’s not funny.. America was recognized as most powerful nation in the world, this current incompetent president proved that it is not. Now China has become more powerful than USA."
"I came here after watching president Trump vs vice president Kamala few days ago. <br>Here I can see, president Biden is trying to be very polite, but president Trump is being more aggressive and yes, maybe healthier. <br>I learn a lot from both debates, about how United States affecting the world and how what happening on this modern World, affecting United States."
This debate was much more productive than  competitive kamala ✨🙌
"330 Million people in the US and its really between these two Clowns to be president 🤡<br><br>I honesty feel sorry for Americans today, stay strong you guys!"

What are &quot;Black Jobs &quot;?&quot;  Trump has refused to answer what he would do for childcare.  He also didn&#39;t answer the childcare question in his debate with Kamala.
"In two debates, I notice Trump refuses to answer how he is going to deport all the immigrants.  He changes the subject and goes on a rant."
I&#39;m a veteran. Total of about 5 years&#39; worth of combat. I have no help from the VA
"Two months later I finally watched this.<br><br>-It&#39;s so much easier to concentrate on what the candidates are saying when there&#39;s no distracting applause, cheering and jeering from an audience. In studio is a good format.<br><br>-If Biden (who was clearly nervous) had slowed down a bit, he might not have his lost of train of thought as he so embarrassingly did. His facial expression in the beginning even looked like that of a person who was tired and ill. However, his performance (and even the look on his face) did improve over the course of the debate. All in all, not bad for an 81 year old with a speech impediment, but he still made the right decision in no longer resisting the call to step aside. It was time.<br><br>- Trump just looking into the camera does work for him. He also proved he can resist taking the bait and no longer just blathers away even during an opponent&#39;s time. The annoying sniffing appears to be gone, too. Experience seems to have been a good teacher as this was not a bad performance. Still, Trump&#39;s assertion that the environment was well looked after during his administration is laughable, he doesn&#39;t say how he would negotiate a deal between Russia &amp; Ukraine, his addressing of the subject of The Proud Boys continues to be weak, as was his response regarding the January 6th riot.<br><br>In summation: Biden made the right move stepping aside, and Trump should&#39;ve done the same thing. No matter what their records indicate, these guys are both too old. <br>Next time let&#39;s see a match up between people who aren&#39;t past their prime."
Why does everyone call trump president???!<br>He’s NOT
"In short:<br>Trump: You are sucks<br>Biden: No, you are sucks"
Lies
"YEAH BIDEN, HANG YOUR HEAD LOW!"
"Finally ,trump finds his match 😂😂😂"
BIDEN LIED THROUGH THIS ENTIRE DEBATE 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
"I follow the predisential debate between Harris and Trump and see confirmation that it doesn&#39;t matter who the next POTUS is. They both grovel to the Israeli lobby. The only difference is that Harris is indeed dumber than Trump but has a more sympathetic face than Trump. And that will be the deciding factor for the US voters. As a Dutchman, I am only interested in the fact that the US is on the decline. And that is good for the world."

Sigan sacrificando al país. A los ciudadanos. Para seguir con una guerra mundial.

Trump is winer
"Biden acceptable, he won 💯 My friend Joe Biden a smart  politician, competence and action."
Trump is on point.  I know he won the election in 2020 but the Democrats DID NOT allow it.  They forgot to cheat in 2016 because they underestimated us and were overly confident in Hillary.  They will not let him win in 2024.
This was GREAT!! Trump looked so good. He performed well. <br>The upcoming debate when Trump will win be Harris will end up the same.
😢
lol
This CNN is siding with Biden
Biden can’t speak well ! He is eating the words
Biden like a robot
"It’s still legal to have plan B pill so no excuse for needing abortion these days , it should be last resort no used for contraception"
"God he looks old and ill, them silly faces he pulls are unprofessional, trump’s right the world is laughing at America and it’s Bidens fault. What about poor white people why don’t they get help to buy homes or free student loans it’s not fair and it causes racism"
More people died of Covid under Biden then Trump  look it up.

NO WAY BUDDY
Being argumentative is a symptom
This was just a little over a month ago.  and the comments are a ghost town and the media vacuum has sucked up everything in its path each day since to the point of changing candidates with 90 days to go.

"Ukraine is NOT NATO! Joe, all these happened because you’re pushing Zelensky to join the alliance!! You’re the one who instigated this &amp; triggered Putin to do such thing!"
President HARRİS🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
This was better than the Trump/Harris debate
"The two biggest lies she told — and it was difficult to choose because she said so many — are the one where she said police had been killed on January 6 and the “fine people” lie in Charlottesville. Both lies are demonstrably false. The fine people lie, which has been discredited for years and is documented on video, has also been thoroughly debunked by liberal Snopes."
"Biden actually talked good points on the Nato argument. he just sounds so weak and timid, kinda sad. cause I appreciate him greatly"
Biden must to retire. Him voice is so tired 😢😢😢
Geriatrics debate!
😂😂😂
Laps
Did we seriously watch an argument about golf for the last part of this debate
Trump
tRump who&#39;s the old one now ? Harris/Walz 🎉🎉🎉
How about Americans being homeless
Americans have always helped themselves if we got our jobs back we could help ourselves again
Talk about golf and being convicted and still nothing about American questions like jobs or anything other than healthcare
I was worried biden the burden was going to have a heart attack😂

"After seeing this NOW, we can understand why Trump is crapping little yellow bricks."
TRUMP TRUMP TRUMP !
😂
"About the age concern, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what&#39;s happening to Biden. Biden has his own health problems. I&#39;ve seen guys older than him with very sharp minds. This guy us sick. Please let him go rest in peace."

"Why would anybody think Kamala will change all of this when this is basically the result of the democrats doing. They are the ones encouraged him to get on stage like this.😢<br><br>They would have actually let this man run America, firmly, until a very non transparent turn of events happened."
Baiden chacha retire le lijiye

"Tru,p won this debate. Hope he can beat Kamala on September 10, and let Trump be our president in 2024 👍🏿"

The media are doing their best to make people forget this debate and who Trump was debating.
Arguing about golf like bros
Took me 55 seconds to laugh
Lol
"You leave off the best line.  One second later, Biden says, “You’re a child”."
fckinu reterda - the whole thing!
"American manufacturers of a number of expensive cars are obliged to stop selling cars to other countries due to the unregulated issuance of loans to people falsifying their income, thus, given further circumstances, it is more profitable to improve the economic reserve, overcrowded prisons and anti-ecology do not suit anyone, this should not have been the case."
"And sleepy joe does it again! Starts off strong, fast, good volume and just comes to a complete stop in the middle of a sentence and forget where he is. That’s some serious skills bro!<br>I remember watching him read off the teleprompter and he’ll say a line and on the screen he’s reading says repeat the line he’ll actually say repeat the line during the sentence. Poor guy."

Jd vance is a fkn liar
<b>ITS  VERY  CLEAR</b>  <b>This  FELLOW  jd vance  LOST  the  DEBATE   With  Mr   TIM  WALZ</b>   1Os  Of  1OOOs  Of  Republican   are  LEAVING  jd  vance   To  JOIN  DEMOCRATS  Mr  TIM  WALZ*
"Y que el verdadero Presidente del 2024, sea nuestro Candidato Republicano Donald J. Trump."
"No sabe usted, lo que me gustaría, que los republicanos, le patearon el trasero a los comunistas, porque en eso se ha convertido el Partido Demócrata. Ahora es el partidos radica, de los comunistas"
"Que equivocado están ustedes. Porque son ustedes los que quieren destruir al País, y disasociaice y quitar el social security, y dicen, que son los republicanos"
JD WON
when does the debate start? It&#39;s hours and hours replaying the same few clips and rallies
"&quot;And though the forest was shrinking, the trees kept voting for the axe, for the axe was clever and convinced the trees that since her handle was made of wood, she was one of them.&quot;"
🤮🤮🤮
Trump could debate if the tables are turned.<br><br>NETWORK: Fox News <br><br>MODERATORS: Jenine Pirro and Jesse Waters.<br><br>FACT-CHECK: Only on Harris
HEADLINE: <br>&quot;CBS MODERATOR VIOLATES DEBATE FACT-CHECK RULES&quot; (That&#39;s called CBS CHEATING! )
"The first time I am feeling, I am in America. That’s the super nice. The beat I ever seen during 20 years. I am here. The boat was very nice a but I would for Trump"
"Moderator: &quot;Senator Vance, you have said you would not have certified the last presidential election.&quot;<br>Vance: &quot;Look at what has happened because Trump was not allowed to remain in office.&quot;"
"Haters, you know Vance lost considerably he lied most of the time"
Nope
He conveniently forgets that food prices are a function of a farm’s overhead which includes the price gouging by industrial billionaires running up costs by buying up farm land and putting higher prices on their products which gets passed along the supply chain and multiplied by the many hands it passes through on the way to market.
Vance really changed my opinion of him tonight. The media had me thinking he was some nut job.<br>Very impressed with how articulate and intelligent he was.
"Haha... Walz didn&#39;t do nothing but show how much better he is than Kamala, she is nowhere even close to his levels, she seems like his secretary now."
Vance won decisively. Idk what Walz strategy was but he agreed with A Lot of Vances points.
Walz and Kamala 2024
"Vance&#39;s interpretation of the abortion issue does not align with their actual stance on the matter. Vance succeeded in pouring a lot of sugar over their opinions, which I would warn all women against. Be careful! Not everything is as it seems!"
Harris and Walz are circus 🤡🤡s. Trump will whip them into line. ❤️DT&amp;JDV. From B.C. 🇨🇦.
Tim Walz literally nodded in agreement when JD Vance said Kamala Harris enabled drug cartels to operate freely in the US.
"Vance won biggy shows how SMART TRUMP is for picking him he <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPoBQuxhjjs&amp;t=94"">1:34</a> would make a terrific president don’t yall agree cnbc"
Tim Walz is a fkn fraud! People !!! Do your homework  get smart! Nothing I N there agenda makes any sense! Lies don&#39;t fix nothin. Twisted burocracy n communism is what will polute this country n it&#39;s already happening
Anyone but Donald Trump for president. Donald Duck would make a better president than Donald Trump
Trump🎉❤
"JD sounds like a car salesman who had my daughter sign an agreement to buy including certain colors are more expensive and the interest rate is inflated but it’s a good buy, NOT, I went back to this bs wheeler dealer and we cut, scissored and threw it in the garbage can. Later, found out the local authorities were looking for him for fraud, money laundering and other charges. Sounding this way isn’t always the case, we’ll see."
"Walz on radio comes across as a common down home blue collar worker with his feet on solid ground, an All American guy. Vance lies on issues of importance and vital to America, spreading slanted misinformation and wishy washy and sneaky clean on his talking points and more of staged platform performer. Definitely, sounds to artificial and sincerely, not genuine."
Vance is a shifty shape shifter ideal a Trump changeling for his lies.
"&quot;I can&#39;t stomach Trump,&quot; J. D. Vance said in an interview with NPR, when describing why he would vote for a third-party candidate. &quot;I think that he&#39;s noxious and is leading the white working class to a very dark place.&quot;"
"J. D. Vance considered voting for Hillary Clinton over Trump: &quot;I think there&#39;s a chance, if I feel like Trump has a really good chance of winning, that I might have to hold my nose and vote for Hillary Clinton.&quot;"
"Since the act&#39;s enactment, over $166 billion in investments in semiconductors and electronics have been announced, showcasing a vigorous response from the industry and a promising future for American technological sovereignty."
"Biden/Harris - A CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law with an aim to bring semiconductor supply chains home. This landmark legislation allocates nearly $53 billion towards U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, research and development, and workforce development."
"Amid this technological push, the U.S. has also seen a remarkable boom in the construction of manufacturing facilities. The U.S. has witnessed a doubling in real manufacturing construction spending since the end of 2021."
"Vance said previously, &quot;My god, what an idiot.&quot; - Vance&#39;s since-deleted tweets criticizing the former president."
BIDEN/HARRIS - Created more manufacturing jobs in 2022 than in any single year in nearly 30 years. A Massive economic bust for China.
U.S. manufacturers are gearing up for a big future and prepping to take supply line issues into their own hands. A new Treasury Department report shines a light on an undeniable surge in U.S. manufacturing.
"Trump the phony Christian couldn&#39;t remember a single Christian prayer before children in church, and the hypocrite couldn&#39;t the words to the &#39;Our Father&#39; - A basic Christian prayer of 66-words."
"FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover spread rumors that the 1950s Democratic presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson was gay; ironically, Hoover was gay and Stevenson wasn&#39;t."
"Republican bag of dirty tricks is considerable and there successful.<br>—In 1972, Senator Edmund Muskie was the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination to run against President Richard Nixon. While campaigning in New Hampshire the editor of the all-important Manchester Union Leader received a letter from a New Hampshire citizen accusing Muskie of using the word &quot;Canuck,&quot; a derogatory term for French Canadians-a significant part of the New Hampshire electorate. Muskie never did any such thing.<br>The letter was later discovered to have been written by a White House aide to President Nixon, Kenneth Clawson).<br>-- At the same time, the editor of the Manchester Union Leader insulted Muskie&#39;s wife, calling her unladylike for drinking too much and telling jokes.<br>Muskie then gave a press conference where he was furious and appeared to cry. This ended his quest for the White House."
Of course the moderators had to fact check because they’re hypocrites one-sided couldn’t help yourself could you? TRUMP 2024 💯🇺🇸👱‍♂️❤️
"As of August 2024, the inflation rate in the United States was 2.5%, while wages grew by 4.6%. This means that wages have been growing faster than inflation since January 2023."
"The Secret Papers of Lee Atwater, Who Invented the Scurrilous Tactics That Trump Normalized An infamous Republican political operative&#39;s unpublished memoir shows how the Party came to embrace lies, racial fearmongering, and winning at any cost. - By Jane Mayer"
"Presently, under the radar Biden/Harris despite GOP&#39;s deceptive propaganda efforts - the United States is producing more oil than any country in history, - yes, more oil than any country.<br>And, despite Trump in 2017 who allowed the Saudi&#39;s, to own our Largest Oil Refinery in America, That&#39;s Right TRump Allowed in Texas - the SAUDI&#39;S TO OWN OUR LARGEST OIL REFINERY IN AMERICA - that is disgusting and criminally undermining our economy. Think on that?<br>Trump&#39;s family made a lucrative deal with the Arabs. Spiking the cost at our fuel pump.<br>And, later, yes, the Trump (Kushner) family, get a $2 Billion dollar payback,<br>and the Republican House sits on their hands and wear Trump&#39;s mask. Isn&#39;t this a treasonable offense?"
"Remember: Trump asked oil execs at Mar-a-Lago for $1 billion for his campaign.<br>In return, Trump pledged to reverse environmental protections and cut their taxes.<br>The deal would net Big Oil $110 billion in tax breaks — 11,000% more than a $1 billion donation.<br>Utter corruption."
"Would any parent on the planet earth allow their teenager to say the same things as Trump?<br>Wash my mouth with soap and blow soap suds!<br>Would any teenager on the planet earth remain in their homes with parents who believe trumps crap do repeat his crap<br>sit in his crap<br>serve his crap over breakfast, lunch and supper<br>and watch his parents vote<br>and throw<br>on our U.S. Constitution. Yes, that&#39;s a teenager who needs to scream out at a canyon and echo his guts out!"
"By the time Trump announced his candidacy on June 16, 2015, the U.S. intelligence community was reportedly already aware of the Kremlin&#39;s interest in Trump. According to The Wall Street Journal, in spring 2015, &quot;US spy agencies captured Russian government officials discussing associates of Mr. Trump, including Mr. [Paul] Manafort,&quot; who would later serve as the second of Trump&#39;s three campaign heads."
"Heads Up America-Russian posts are often accompanied by variations of the same hashtag,<br>&quot;Grow a spine and vote Jill Stein.&quot;<br>&quot;This hasn&#39;t gotten enough attention,&quot; said Andrew Weiss, a Russian expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, referring to Moscow&#39;s and Putin&#39;s efforts to promote Stein, on the Green Party ticket.<br>An NBC News analysis found that Russians working under the direction of the Internet Research Agency, the St. Petersburg-based firm run by a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, tweeted the phrase &quot;Jill Stein&quot; over 1,000 times."
"Setoodeh said he began interviewing the former president for his book in 2021. He added that he spoke with Trump, aged 78, (be in his eighties soon) and is mentally regressing after six interview sessions, adding,<br>&quot;Donald Trump had severe memory issues,&quot;<br>Setoodeh claimed. &quot;As the journalist who spent the most time with him, I have to say, he couldn&#39;t remember things. He couldn&#39;t even remember me.&quot;"
"Trump reported millions in negative income in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2020, and he paid only $750 in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017."
"Trump often reports zero charitable donations year in and year out, IRS returns show.<br>What did Trump show during his time in office - he reported $1.8 million in charitable giving in 2017, and just over $500,000 in charitable donations in 2018 and 2019, the returns show.<br>What da??"
"In 2017, Trump&#39;s first year in office, he also made $6.5 million from China, the returns show.<br>The source of the China payments is not clear from the returns. The payments were a hypocritical surprise."
"Unfortunately, 2017 tax law that was the signature achievement of Donald Trump&#39;s administration will cost 50% more than originally forecast, because wealthy taxpayers have found loopholes that significantly reduce their tax burdens.<br>That&#39;s according to a report released Thursday by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget, which advocates for fiscal restraint.<br>Extending the Trump tax cuts would cost the Treasury Department $4 trillion over 10 years, up from $286 billion in 2018."
"Trump meets w/ Putin. Then, on 8/3/2019, just 3 days later, Trump requests a list of US spies.<br>That&#39;s right!<br>By 2021 the CIA reports a high number of their agents are being captured and/or murdered. An FBI search at Mar A Lago finds more documents w/ lists-our top spies."
"Thom Hartmann<br>Hamas apparently knew how to get around Israel&#39;s Iron Dome defenses, fascinating. - They (Hamas) probably learned this from Iran. Iran almost certainly got the information from Russia.<br>And who gave it to Russia? Sure looks like (via Mar-a-lago USA top secret) Donald Trump, at the request of Putin."
"The national debt had risen by almost $7.8 trillion during Trump&#39;s time in office. That&#39;s nearly twice as much as what Americans owe on student loans, car loans, credit cards and every other type of debt other than mortgages, combined, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It amounts to about $23,500 in new federal debt for every person in the country."
"A former Wharton student stated &quot;Professor Kelley told me 100 times over three decades that &quot;Donald Trump was the dumbest goddam student I ever had.&quot; | remember his emphasis and inflection — it went like this - &quot;Donald<br>Trump was the dumbest goddam student I ever had.&quot; Dr. Kelley told me this after Trump had become a celebrity but long before he was considered a political figure. Dr. Kelley often referred to Trump&#39;s arrogance when he told of this - that Trump came to Wharton thinking he already knew everything.&quot;<br>-- this isn&#39;t surprising, but his propaganda machine will say the absolute, absolutely the opposite. Trump is"
"Schwartz called writing, &#39;The Art of the Deal, his<br>&quot;greatest regret in life, without question,&quot; and both he and the book&#39;s publisher, Howard Kaminsky, alleged that Trump had played no role in the actual writing of the book. -<br>- So the fraud set its groundwork.<br>A no role - a phony - but he blabbered mouthed from the gulf coast to the Canadian borders, and went east coast to west coach preaching &#39;The Big Lie&#39; and this serial felon lied all the way to the Banks, and profited &#39;the Big Lie!&#39; America bought the &#39;Biggest Lie, and was and is not who he says he is.<br>He didn&#39;t write a word, &#39;The Art of the Deal, and is an author only of lies. Many bought into it, and here we are."
"Ed &#39;Big Al Bundy&#39; O&#39;Neill, &quot;Psychopaths like Trump have a tendency to lie a lot and make stuff up to make themselves feel that they are bigger, better, smarter, better looking, and superior to everyone else than they really are.<br>— will lie to inflate their ego and to get what they want no matter what the consequences are.<br>— That is why there should be safeguards that would detect Psychopaths and prevent them from infiltrating Government and Business because they are a threat to all of society.<br>- And the more Psychopaths that make it up to the top of the business and government ladder, the more the world will likely perish due to them.&quot; -<br>- Ed &#39;Big Al Bundy&#39; O&#39;Neill added. &quot;I&#39;ve got a doctorate from YSU, an honorary doctorate that I&#39;m going to give back,&quot; O&#39;Neill reportedly said.<br>&quot;I don&#39;t want it. I&#39;m going to start calling it Trump-U. And I think a lot of people feel that way.&quot;"
Vance won decisively. Idk what Walz strategy was but he agreed with A Lot of Vances points.
JD killed it!
Creep Tim .
CBS is almost worst that CNBC.
Vance just demolished Walz.
Jd Vance destroyed whatever that other guy was. And CBS .
Why didn&#39;t Tim mention that  TRAMP&#39;S a convicted FELON &amp; RAPIST!
Walz wins. Vance &amp; Trump to the TRASH
CBS is garbage and anybody that thinks CBS ain&#39;t his garbage 😆
WALZ IS GETTING SPANKED😂😂😂

Before we start does anyone need tampons😂
I LOVE HER 😍
"Im gone.  Guy who is watching this, is not worth my time because of TDS."
Looks to me like Vance is winning with common sense🇺🇸🇺🇸!!!
Without a MN reference Walz has nothing to say?

Timmy looks kinda panicked. He sure has a lot of times he &quot;mis-speaks&quot;!
VANCE BEATING THE PANTS OFF OF THE KOTEX KWEEN!!!😂
VANCE BEATING THE PANTS OFF OF THE KOTEX KWEEN!!!😂
Unfairly moderated….not surprising
This seems so normal when we don&#39;t have an orange demented clown.
I&#39;ve heard 3 separate lies fall out of JD&#39;s face.
Never have any of us seen two bigger clowns than the laughing she and the tampon him.
"If (big if) Kammie and Walz win the election and something should happen to Kamala, that would mean this guy would be president of the free world with his finger on the bottom. God help us!!!!! He ran away from his troop -- Vance went to a foreign country to be with his troop."
Will Walz be wearing special &quot;talking&quot; earrings?!🙄🙄🙄
Dude dont even know what his daughter eats and disrespected her after she told him.  the level of manipulation to try to make a positive note of harris and walz is intense.
Are you and your commentators going to be unbiased? My guess would be no. . We will see
Ba ha ha ha ..what is this buffoonery?
What momentum? Whoa re you talking about?  This some come from kind of joke pundit?
He is a pure idiot
LIARS Trump &amp; Vance are Devil LIARS

"Will Walz give JD the middle finger, like he did to the people at the stadium,  when he doesn&#39;t like a remark?"
A vote for Kamala is a vote for war..
I don’t think Minnesota is at all attractive to the rest of the country. I don’t think being from Minnesota is a selling point.
So far it’s all Walz -where is the equal representation leading up to the debate? And the lies!!!!! This is why mainstream media is so lacking in truth and so shamefully biased.
"no... yall are creepy.  especially to not actually talk about anything.  no issues which are becoming still to this day more and more non ignorable. <br>yall attack your opponents they give us hope with words then yall resound by either attacking them again,  copying or 1uping their promises without coming up with your own. and siren right talking about yourselfs. <br>fir example in this video when tim commiserate teumps presidency as a disaster that&#39;s the biggest lie compared to what you said Bidens was.  Covid was ending during the transfer of power and biden ended covid by shutting down our financial relief.... <br>biden and kamala has done nothing for any of us but a lot of something for everyone else.  <br><br>the new leader of the UN compliments trump for biting back and forcing everyone else to pay up and support their neighbors, because we .... US &lt;-- should not have to come out of our pockets anymore than we already do to keep Navy <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23hooyah"">#Hooyah</a> ships at sea everywhere.  <br>the UN leader has agreed that everyone else in the UN is not too poor to contribute anymore.  <br>If you want to start delusional that&#39;s in you.  if you have an argument with all that I&#39;m saying; respond. and i expect everyone else that feels the way i do,  dem or rep to also respond to this comment.  <br>are we not more tired and aggregated than ever before? a week as struggling? <br>Senior citizens please here this.  you are retired. your children and their children are not.  we have to carry this all on after we prepare your funerals,  do you care about how our retirement is? do you care if we have to deal with and pay for war until 2048?"
Word Salad on the menu tonight for the blue voters 😂
Vance/Trump 2024
"Oh the laughing hieena, 😅😅😅😅😅 especially when he was dancing in his underware at the gay pride parade. What a great thing to have as a vice president, someone to ĺooķ,up to and be so proud of......"
He is terrible ..... why did Camel choose him!?
"Trump , Trump, Trump"
"Oh my gosh, this just keeps getting better.  Waltz gets off the plane and one person clapps"
Tim is a weirdo and videos to prove it!
Tim is the best
"Vance is a vile man with a thing against women and immigrants, now that he’s a full on Trumper"
A waltz this man does not need tampons nor do any other men
Wipe up the floor with them JD
Does Piers Morgan ever get through an interview without talking across people and not letting other people finish their sentences?
I feel I’m either 100% with piers Morgan or 100% against him. This time I’m 100% with him
blair looks like she did one of those uncanny makeup trends
That’s his wife???!!! 😮🤨🧐
Piers Morgan should invited nick avocado to the show
Margot Squares
I used to like sweets!
&quot;plus size&quot;.. its called fat
Fatty
Jackson Sarah Young Jeffrey Walker Jennifer
Went to a party<br>I ate all night<br>I ate sixteen hamburgers <br>And I started up a fight<br>But now I am jaded<br>You&#39;re out of luck<br>I&#39;m rolling down the stairs<br>Too fat to work…….
Weak men are dangerous
How is he a father............must have one humungous penii
"Being happy in one&#39;s skin, is not the same as flouting being out of shape.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s doing that.  He&#39;s just being happy and himself.  If he could lose weight, I&#39;m sure he would.  We don&#39;t anyone regarding of whether we agree w/ their state of being, to be unhappy in their own skin."
No way missionary goes on in that bedroom
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iPqwf01s64&amp;t=382"">6:22</a> theirs that insecurity I knew was there. He projects it on to his wife. Got it 👍🏾"
Well someone&#39;s punching above his weight...😮😮
Is funny the person that have debating how all that surgery on her face
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iPqwf01s64&amp;t=48"">0:48</a> &quot;Really? That&#39;s what people are watching?&quot; My thoughts exactly."
The fact that he is promoting obesity is shocking I was near 20 stone and had a shock at the doctors and within a year I have dropped over 4 stone by completely Changing my diet and walking more if he feels happy in his own skin fair enough that&#39;s up to him but promoting junk food and bad diets aren&#39;t right I have been down the same road I was living of junk food takeouts dinners enough to feed 2 people plus dessert afterwards only going to work and home nothing in-between days of work all i done was eat all day and I know it&#39;s hard to change but it just takes something to click now im eating 3 times a day and haven&#39;t had any takeouts apart from when I&#39;m in Spain in over a year if your happy in your own body fair enough but don&#39;t promote bad diets or junk food
Internet has killed most things
Genetics 🤣
Well done Piers
"If you google old fat people and hit images, not too many pictures show up. That says it all."
Why
"I liked piers but lately he is just being rude,always right  and just generally a 😂"
Why would they bring in some random trans dude to talk about this lol who cares
"This interview was badly handled, Piers could have allowed the man to speak more rather than talking over him and doing too much"
That Blaire White person has a Michael Jackson nose replica on her face. <br>What&#39;s going on in the world Lol
Maybe he can rent himself out as a  blimp character in the Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Parade. Or have &#39;GOODYEAR&quot; painted on his side so he can float over the Rose Bowl on New Year&#39;s Day.
that thing had babies with that lady ?
"People choose themselves what they put in their body, like if you seen a crackhead promoting crack, you wouldn&#39;t start taking crack, leave this guy alone ffs"
"What&#39;s funny is that there have been actual studies that have been done that show when you work out your body releases endorphins which is basically a dopamine rush, making you feel good. It doesn&#39;t make sense to not workout."
His wife is so cute people say you need to stay lean and muscular to get girls n look at him😂
Holy cow
"Why not promote healthy eating, show how to eat sensibly, exercise regularly"
They better leave my girl Abby out of this- not that it should matter but her account is now being used to document her weightloss journey
Blair White is very beautiful even though it cost a lot of money to get there!
lol she won’t stay with him for long
His wife is kinda bad
This is why aliens don&#39;t visit us....
"I agree with Piers, but if he’s not even going to let him speak, then he shouldn’t invite him on his show."
I think I&#39;m moving to the UK we&#39;re truth and facts are aloud
Start your day with some brain
That&#39;s his wife...? She&#39;s gotta be mental.
I&#39;m here one year later but I doubt the Fatvocate -fat advocate is.
The bigger you get. The more your heart works.
craig
fat and obese are not the same
Thats why glutonny became a sin.
"OK, so as anybody ever heard of the dangers of botox? 🤣 She&#39;s there talking about the dangers of obesity."
She came for the fame and stayed for the life insurance.
He just influenced me to go to the gym
Why would you record yourself eating a Reese&#39;s peanut butter cup? People are weird af
The one time I agree with Pierce.
"Hey fatty bom bom, chill out on those cheese burgers and you might be able to spend some of that money and be with your family"
Piers should have Nikokado Avocado on his show
He must earn some serious coin if he&#39;s able to pull that bird
What a pointless segment. That was just inviting some dude on to berate him and his wife about his weight.
Nothing like being a big pile of s*** and trying to make it look cool as an influencer
"Denying the actual definition of what you are is part of the whole problem, you are denying you have a problem. &quot;Well, let&#39;s not call it..... &lt;insert every adjective that describes you to a T.&gt;&quot;<br>Also, pretty sure his gf has a fat fetish."
"I mean.. Piers is also fat and he was eating burgers on his program with celebration, so I find it funny that he is the one to say what is healthy and what is not."
The look in his wife’s eyes you can see she is waiting for him to choke on a donut
Reject modernity.  Embrace masculinity
the american done my head in dissing george but shes got thousands worth of cosmetics on her face
425
"the wife is a feeder, she will feed him till she klills him and then move on"
His favorite band must be OB/CD
His wife is like Jill Biden. Complicit
Over 30 stone
At least George is a real person unlike Blaire. She looked like a doll with her plastered on make up and her lipstick placed higher than her upper lip. Give me real people like George and not these fakes.
One of the rare occasions where I totally agree with Piers.
"This was such a misfire, both Piers and Blaire (wild choice for a guest btw) and all the comments are just talking around this guy purely because of his weight. <br><br>He clearly said he’s not proud of his weight, he wouldn’t recommend for anyone to gain weight like he did, that he appreciates the health risks and that there is an issue with obesity in the UK, and that he’s currently working to lose weight!! <br><br>His videos are for fun and (now) money. He’s literally making fun of himself in his videos. <br><br>Why is everyone talking like this is a body positivity activist! He’s trying to lose weight, the body positivity cult would crucify him! <br><br>It was like Piers wasn’t even interviewing the person in front of him, he wasn’t listening at all. They literally said he was working on losing weight and Piers not long after says “why don’t you go on a fitness/weight loss journey and show that?” ????"
Those food tic toks gave me ptsd discusting
"These people just benefit of the age we live in, even thought none of it is thanks to them... If it were just 1000 or even a 100 years ago, they&#39;d be the first one to go. There&#39;s no place in nature for this, natural selection would deal with those very very quickly"
"Nothing funny about it, he is in total denial 😂"
108.9 on your dial!
"Well most Trump supporters fall into the obese category.  I know, because I’ve been to 3 of his rallies.   🤷🏻"
Is that craig from ppl just do nothing
His wife is fine 👌 But he’s 🤮 🤮
Interesting topic. I just wish Pierre’s didn’t constantly talk over guests like he does in this video
Fat influencers should not be allowed to be around children
Is that Harvey&#39;s dad? (Katie Price)
One of George’s influencers insulted me for being slim.
"Private health care doesn’t cover A&amp;E or ambulances, or intensive care of any form. <br><br>Nice try, but you can’t use that to get off the hook. And in all fairness, there’s a high chance you’ll use all 3 as you’re one breath away from a heart attack or stroke….."
"Planet Earth is done, doomed and finished."
Its just immature hes in his late 30s just grow up and get a proper job 😂😂
"its a spit in the face for people like me with psoriasis (which can&#39;t be cured), who has occasional flare ups, that these obese people wanna share this body positivity movement with people who actually have unfixable circumstances"
Pounds in excess pounds 😂😂😂 that one got me😂😂
Piers is honestly being so disrespectful but he usually is. I agree with some of what he’s saying but the way he’s communicating is going to make people not want to do anything. They may even do the opposite in spite of his rude comments
There’s no way that’s his wife bro she’s way too hot for him
They make money getting fat and then they make money losing weight. Come on people. Contribute to the f ing world.
he makes piers morgan look thin
"Just clicked on the video to say it&#39;s unfair to show the frame of the obese man on a wider frame than that of piers. May not have been intentional but it shows so much meaning of the two. A lack of balance, such as the conversation and showcasing more of the body of the man in doing so. Piers is not a healthy looking man either, and to shoot both subjects this way is already putting in a negative impression. Bad journalism."
As said by the slim and slender piers morgan 😭🤣
Heart attack doesn’t care about you body positively! Diabetes doesn’t care about that!
Im more stunned that he got a girl like that and had a kid with her.....clearly money talks
Feel bad for that girl dude probably stunk
The bad effect of obesity on the body is too much consequence in having the same lifestyle as him well I guess he is earning money and he is living a yolo life
Blaire has no right to talk with that plastic face.
If you can be so easily be influenced by someone then you must be weak minded to begin with.
fat people should pay more.....insurance as well
How is paying for an Xtra seat raising them prices for others? Here he goes again running his mouth while clueless.
It&#39;s not as bad as an overweight woman trying to give me diet advice and telling me I need to be eating vegetables (I love vegetables so I don&#39;t need to be encouraged) But she was completely unaware that she was bigger than I am. I&#39;m not that big. I didn&#39;t ask her for advice! But people are always trying to analyze things that don&#39;t involve them at all and they know nothing about.
No discrimination.  Get your head out of the chicken bucket.  I&#39;m a big man 6&#39;5&quot; 285 lbs.  I fly either business or first class.  I don&#39;t whine about it.
"When it pertains to women, this is what *I think*:
<br>
<br>*Thicc*: female proportions and the curves are a bit more exagerated/bodyfat-augmented than average.
<br>*Fat*: You have a BMI of &gt; 29 and a fat percentage of &gt;30% and most importantly out of proportion
<br>*Plus-size*: All your features (incl muscles, joints, etc) are bigger than average, but you still see the female silhouette because of good fat distribution
<br>*Big*: fat
<br>*Plump*:  average fat% but BMI &gt;27 and lacking proportion
<br>*chubby*: plus-size but petite
<br>*curvy*: plus-size or thicc
<br>
<br>Fat is the only one here <b>I think</b> is objectively unhealthy and mostly unattractive"
Kids have become ultimate brats!
She needs too use boat travel they can accommodate 😅
No how about losing some weight so you can fit into one seat and not be a safety hazard to everyone on your flight.
It’s all effin ridiculous.
Children and young people are so thin skinned nowadays.
"confused, if you&#39;re offended she said &quot;girls&quot; then you should be offended by calling a school a &quot;girls&quot; school? HYPOCRISY"
"Sitting next to an oversized whale makes me lose my dignity! What an a$$, and a gigantic one, at that!"
"I never thought I&#39;d live to see one that washed up so far inland. 😧 Life Lesson: If you don&#39;t want to attract mockery, don&#39;t try to push your delusions on others."
"All plus sized people should be given absolutely no benefits or special treatment for being fat whatsoever, in fact, ban them from all flights."
The time is coming when the label &quot;racist&quot; will be something to be proud of.I am proud to carry that label.
"Plus size 😂 How is that nicer than just saying fat? Or, more accurately,  morbidly obese."
"I mostly arrive last in most areas , but I try not to bug people about it."
Too bad…. Go on a diet. I’m skinny maybe I should get half off huh
well we werent the one making her plus size.
Today&#39;s generation is challenging reality itself
Then LOOSE weight‼️‼️
Tall people don’t get more leg room unless they buy a business or first-class seat. They can’t change their height. FAT people CAN work on changing their weight.
if she doesn&#39;t identify as a girl she/he/it should be banned from ONLY girls school....
That&#39;s why airplanes have cargo  area 😅😅
"Why call them Plus Size?  Just say Fat, that’s what they are"
But where does Piers find these obnoxious people who can&#39;t differentiate between reality and stupidity? And that woman should not travel in Airplanes and even if she does then she should check in as luggage and not passenger
"I’m the first to agree that airplane seats are too small. But until or unless that is ever resolved, instead of being entitled, maybe have some compassion for the person who is being squished up next to you?"
"That happened to my sons bus driver once. He would get to the school and dismiss the “ladies first” and then the boys. Of course, you had to have that one student make a stink over it and the bus driver got in trouble over it."
It is the first time I agree with him 100%.
Ahh Diabetty<br><br>Run or she&#39;ll eat your babies
Slob.
"Dear lord. They have to pump an extra ton of fuel into the plane to carry those land-whales so they already add 1.5 tons to the plane. Girl, ...there are physical limits. They are only two or three all-you-can-eat buffets away from needing a C5-Galaxy. What will happen then? A petition for a second transport rack?"
The world has gone bananas!  This generation has no respect for authority.  All thin non-binary is rubbish!   Teachers these days have no rights.  STFU <del>-Love Piers Morgan--</del>
The select few…are the few members of fat acceptance who are still alive… not the ones of average size.
Perhaps the airlines should provide accommodations on their freighters  for these entitled buffalo gals.
Agree
Can’t argue with stupidity .
Well she must always get double at McDonald’s .
When did being a girl or woman become a dirty word
If people have to pay extra for heavy luggage then obese people should do the same thing
"I can remember a time when people flew they dressed properly they behaved themselves and if someone behaved badly they were shocked and horrified, today people act like they don&#39;t have a single living brain cell."
How did the teacher know the girl identified as a boy ffs
Its just pathetic
"Im surprised she is allowed to travel on regular planes, she should go on cargo!"
"Love the university clip, gives me hope"
Billy o Reilly has let himself go
When I send air cargo I pay by the kg - why should that girl that likes eating not be treated as cargo
Naah you should pay extra
Rancors go in the hold
LIBBY WOMAN
"LOL this is exactly what happens when people are allowed access to the internet, the delusion is they think it gives them authority or entitlement. I wish I&#39;d studied sociology at school. Because cognitively people are seriously struggling with sanity and it&#39;s having a detrimental effect on society."
She recommends concrete steps bc that’s all that can support her😂
Obesity is not the airlines fault it’s yours
So the fat girl gets extra seats. I bet she’ll say something like skinny people should share seats
There are those planes that crate up hippopotamus’ to move them around. She should use that.
"The name, plus size , gives relief for pigs, to being pigs."
"I wanted go to journalist school, then I was educated. I got a butt lift, Botox, and transcranial  magnetic stimulation. Now I don’t offend anyone. It’s a thing."
Thought ‘fly’ meant beautiful. Going to stay home.
I want to know where his plug goes
He wants to know where man tampons go.
How about a nice seat in the cargo area.
US Universities have lost their quality and credibility
One word: salad
"Just as your carry on luggage has to fit certain dimensions your body should also fit in the seat without spill over and discomfort to other fliers.  If this woman is too large for the seat then put this woman, and her luggage, on a cargo flight and charge her fare by the pound.  I am tired of people who can&#39;t live by the rules demanding special treatment."
The first one was wild
Lose weight
Everybody is entitled to dignity and respect.<br>But not two seats for the price of one.<br>America has been socially assaulted by the left for years now. We are a tolerant people and have done our best to accommodate various segments of society that are out of the norm.<br>This tolerance has served to enable the extremists. And America&#39;s moderates have had enough. November&#39;s presidential election will serve to show less about Trump and more a horrified disenfranchisement with Biden.
Lose weight 😅
I’m a fat guy and I couldn’t agree more! Over the last six years I’ve lost 150 pounds. Before I lost weight I bought two seats on a plane. My fat. My cost.
Dont be PLUS sizef then
Ummmm…so airlines should install sofas for fat girls???
She&#39;s so healthy that she needs oxygen and can&#39;t even walk down the length of a plane without a wheelchair
"I&#39;d never support that petition. Obese people should pay double. They cause more fuel consumption, thus more pollution etc. Etc."
she looks like an massively over wieght brett cooper
This whole „The majority has to conform to the minority.“ will never work. It‘s an unsustainable fad.
Whenever someone screams „Your racism is showing.“ I have to laugh.
I feel sorry for the passengers next to the lady
"Make sure the travel industry serves everyone not just a select few? Your part of the select few they have to go so far out of their way for, cus you can&#39;t walk to airport gates, can&#39;t carry luggage, can&#39;t sit in a normal seat, probably can&#39;t sleep in standard hotel beds, can&#39;t sit in any sort of hot weather, can go on any excursions without assistance and special measures. <br><br>Yet you have the gaul to demand more."
&#39;Mr Bo&#39;sun; pass me my largest harpoon!&#39;
"&quot;SHE WAS THE SIZE OF THE PLANE THAT SHE WANTED TO FLY&quot; I&#39;m dead, this word is amazing. Thank you"
I identify as a fridge.<br>Full of beer. 😜
Put the happy meals down.
"Being unhealthy and proud isnt a reason to be unhealthy. Youre ashamed of yourself and are grasping at straws to feel validated because you&#39;re unwilling to change. <br>This includes trans - if youre unwilling to change, to realize that how you feel isnt a moral justification to change the definition of what a woman is nor to force irresponsible opinions on the rest of society. Lgbtq+++++ is just becoming an excuse to wave your hand and be however you wanna be. Male rapist to women tofay, identifies as a woman tomorrow, can use womans restrooms and lockers.<br>Children? Its confusing af for everyone forming an identity as it is, now you wanna add a total disregard of social and moral standards? Lmao wow.<br>Tomorrow im gonna identify as your aunt."
Pierce: Because you’re a Beast<br><br>Me: you just proved their point of bullying.
High demand anybody with obesity to lose the weight and stop telling other to accept them for being fat.fst is a unhealthy State for the body why should we have to accept it
Do we need larger exit rows are I doubt she would get out.
Waiting for the “we need a larger luggage allowance because our clothes are bigger”
I do not want to sit next to you.
"“Plus size”- typical obfuscating euphemism.<br>Medical term is : morbidly obese. <br>Eat less, weigh less. Eat more, buy two tickets. Accountability for one’s actions is good for one’s mental health."
&quot; PLUS SIZE &quot; Means Porker!
Kevin is the problem and definitely not part of the solution…
Love your work Piers…
The woman is grotesque with a total lack of self control.
They need more seats? What they need to do is lose weight.
At least this woman never hacked a murder victims phone.
Ever notice that really obese people have a permanent frown on both  sides of their mouths? Lol i only see it on fat people
Piers Morgan is &quot;ludicrous.&quot;
I think she might require the whole plane to herself -- which sounds completely fair to me.  My concern would be that she might eat the plane -- and the entire crew -- before they have a chance to do their jobs.
Airline seats should generally be bigger.
"Who cares, whatever happened to individualism"
"Shame has value when it comes from within, you dont need more from the outside. The argument that smoking is also bad or &quot;other stuff is bad too&quot; isnt an argument, you should try to be healthy where you find it worth while since being 100% perfect is impossible. Glorification of morbid obesity should not be allowed, just as we dont allow people to glorify drugs or gambling, obviously. Insane to me people have this &quot;i can do whatever i want because its my body&quot; mentality when you have children who depend and rely on you, absolute nonsense of people just justifying what they do because they dont want to think of actual consequences. I think these messages like that prey on people in vulnerable states who are looking for any reason to keep doing what they are doing instead of getting the possible help for the underlying problems they have."
The thing is peirs is asking a man who is pretending to be a woman if being fat is wrong <br>It&#39;s not something that makes sense
"cmon we all know there&#39;re a lot of people who have fat-fetish to be fair, it take like 1/4 to 1/3 out of all the rule 34 gallery including super fat characters, especially fat furries"
I hate tv interviews because its literally just <br>&quot;Im great and right!&quot; <br>&quot;No you&#39;re wrong!&quot; <br>&quot;Blahblahblahnouourewronginrightaaaa-&quot; <br>&quot;Sorry we&#39;re out of time goodbye!!!&quot;
"Coming from someone who was 140lbs over weight, it&#39;s horrible to be that big, and there&#39;s nothing glorious about it. Get off your lazy ass, quit shoveling food down your throat,  and change your life!  I was fat shamed and it was a good thing! I appreciate it!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=360"">6:00</a> - And then there&#39;s furry pron and you&#39;re really not ready for that."
"Ah come on guys healthy food is cheaper than fast food and it&#39;s cheaper than THAT AMOUNT of food regardless.<br>Just buy groceries and cook. If your standard for food are delivery apps, then yeah, &quot;healthy&quot; is more expensive."
"Guys, I&#39;ve figured it out. It&#39;s not a fat people fetish, it&#39;s a tactic to speed run inheritance."
The fact that this man managed to make a 21 minute reaction video out of a 7 minute video is insane lmfaoo
Saw the thumbnail on this old video and my first thought was is this guy still alive?
The “meta” for a fat man having an attractive girlfriend or wife is if he has money. That isn’t new or unique. Women mostly just care about money so being fat is nearly inconsequential.
(I do agree on your take with alcohol... this country has a load of alcoholics)
"Correction AsNoitall:  it is NOT a God given right to be obese.  It&#39;s a intentional &quot;devil may care&quot; cause in harming your own body, that God gave you, leading to induced health issues and death.  This IS NOT a God given right.  Killing yourself slowly over-eating foods, and then making a big joke of it.  The wife could care less of the health risk to her husband... as long as she&#39; getting free air-time on TikTok.  It&#39;s a free will choice, yes, but with all the fucked-up people out there, he&#39;s sending the wrong signals or impressions to being fat.  And to that, God does not look kindly on.  You are accountable to God first and for most...."
Let’s do it ? Ok! ✅
"Why do people say eating healthy is expensive, its way cheaper. Even if it wasn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t buying less food, and eating healthy be cheaper."
From all the bad shit you can see and learn from the internet.. there will always be more..
When culture is based on corporate needs.
In my country there is no single unhealthy thing that cost less than healthy food
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=514"">8:34</a> right there with ya"
&quot;Let&#39;s do it&quot;. I&#39;m dying over here😂
Jeez how much work did he get done to look like that?
Also any rational person knows how much he weighs pretty accurately without him saying. Someone of that size is about 700 pounds.
This is just fucking ridiculous at this point some people are fat because the worst type of food for you is the cheapest option growing up keeping fresh fruit and vegies wasn’t cheap for a snack but it was easier to buy a bag of chips and because ur a kid and u don’t know how to tell ur self no so u eat till ur full and then u put the bag of chips away then a few hours later mama makes dinner and u eat till ur full again its not that parents encourage bad eating habits its just i didn’t know how badly my habbits were untill i put some weight on shit happens u can’t say fat is unhealthy because fat is normal its apart of animal kingdom we get fat to hibernate it just extra food storage just loads of people now don’t need a diet they need to fast
"Typical store bought Orange juice isnt much different than Coke really, to be fair."
"I would feel gross doing it, let&#39;s do it😂"
"you can always bend facts with statistics, In 2022, approximately 3.6 million people were treated in emergency departments for injuries involving sports and recreational equipment. In 2021, exercise equipment-related injuries resulted in 40,485 fatalities. you can argue going to the gym is bad. 🤣🤣"
Oh no.  His chick is into it.
Make soft drink and  potato ship aisles in supermarket thin so only skinny people can buy that shit.
If I’m not mistaken I think he has died since this….
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=217"">3:37</a> There he is. In the fat… I mean flesh."
Anatole never fails to prove me right
"For tens of thousands of years humans had to work very hard to acquire food. For the majority of our existence we broke even in terms of energy gain vs energy expense with food. The gain was slightly more give the fact that we&#39;re still around, obviously. <br>It&#39;s only for the last couple of decades where food has become so widespread available in extreme abundance, topped off with a capitalistic system who&#39;s single purpose it is to sell the consumer as much as possible, and you got the perfect recipe for a global obesity epidemic. <br>Human&#39;s are literally gorging themselves to death as a result of our own success. We&#39;re not cognitively wired to resist our urges to eat, it&#39;s a result of thousands of years of habit and evolution. What we can do however is become consciously aware of this phenomenon and teach our kids how to responsibly handle food. Which is the exact opposite of body positivity"
Have you ever seen a 300 pound 70 year old? Food for thought. Pun intended.

"Satan has won the last 4 million rounds,  and the last 100 were by K.O. 😈"
"&quot;growing up in poverty&quot; last i checked it doesnt cost money to do idk, jogging, or pull ups on PUBLIC (free) street fitnesses etc. she is obv coping with the fact that she is gonna be a single mother in the next few years and will 100% tell to her kid not to repeat the same mistakes. If anything growing up in poverty should result in you being skinnier"
"He is hurting other people by doing this though, not only is he encouraging others to be obese, he&#39;s putting a burden on the nhs a system that everyone pays for."
"I find it funny, being a fat man myself, is that all those people are the ones ranting on twitter asking for freedom of speech, freedom of whatever, but when it comes to something they disagree, they are all against it. Fat people, gay people, what ever.. so it&#39;s freedom of speech as long as you agree with it. LoL.<br>Cmon, let people be fat, gay, bi, whatever, what others do have zero influence on my life."
"Seriously. I dont think its that bad. Most of them die before 50/60 but still pay taxes and contribute to society. If someone has data and statistics that show that most of them dont work because of health issues I will retract this, but these 350 plus pound cases are of the rarer kind, at least in my country.  Most of them are 220-300. They can walk and work, just no sports etc."
"Orange Juice isnt healthy from that pack.<br>Only if u make it urself, and it still has alot of fruitsugars. But they burn faster"

"You don&#39;t have to know all of the fetish metas to know that if you can imagine it, there&#39;s a meta for it 😅"
What if it was about anorexia ?
Have them watch the movie &quot;the whale&quot;
Since they are influencing many others to be obese that is why it costs the country so much money. they may have private healthcare but the people they influence to do this lifestyle do not so essentially they do contribute to that cost
"FYI orange juice is worst than a coca cola, the sugar is the worst you can eat, and to drink this at breakfirst is killing your estomac."
My uncle is a truck driver the donkey show isn’t just an old thing the odds of him telling me this story yesterday then this popping up is funny as hell
Sayin that someone who lives until 50&#39;s and die of obesity costs more than someone who lives healthy until thei 90&#39;s are insane.
"How that guy is living his life is no one&#39;s business. He&#39;s getting a lot of money from his videos, I&#39;m sure the ones complaining about him are the ones watching those videos."
&quot;death cult&quot; is the best definition I&#39;ve ever heard for the fat positivity movement.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=655"">10:55</a>"
"ALSO, IT&#39;S REALLY SAD HOW MONEY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN HIS HEALTH."
IMAGINE BEING A BLOB THAT JUST EXISTS TO EXIST.
lol Asmon doesn’t now anything about nutrition 🤣🤣🤣
Should be mandatpry for health insurance to be 2-3x as expensive for people who are over 2-3x the normal weight.
His wife is a good lookin lady... she&#39;ll out last him and have great prospects and maybe a little money when he passes
"I&#39;ve worked at nursing homes. It&#39;s 80% old people, 10% young morbidly obese, 5% crippled by accident 5% cancer and dying. <br>The young obese are the hardest (physically) to take care of. When you&#39;re too fat for a hoyer lift, legs leaking with lymphedema and won&#39;t even help turn yourself you break the backs of the people tasked to care for you. It&#39;s unfair and robs the elderly of time for caregivers."
Obesity is gross
Bros gonna influence for a couple years until he dies…. So it can’t be that big of a deal LOL bros got another couple years to go until his heart fails
Americans need to return to Jesus Christ.
Absolutely it should be allowed!…..fucking you are hilarious and I love you!!
I love Blair White
Fatfluencers?!
Sad
How do they afford this lifestyle
14 mins in I couldn’t disagree more mate. Unless you were raised in poor Britain in the 90s you have no idea how little we knew about nutrition. Knowbody cared. I didn’t know fruit has sugar till I started a kitchen job at 16. My grandparents used to give us sugar sandwiches if we were hungry cause it tasted like cake and no one could afford cakes. This is real life bro. I’m now 33 and go to great lengths just to maintain a chubby physique and not of over the deep end. I will forever have issues around food now because of that time. That’s why schools try so hard now to teach about healthy eating. Also when I was a kid sugar was in no way a bad thing. Fat was the enemy in all forms.
"Literally the only thing a man should and must eat, is pure natural meat. Veggies and fruits are just a gmo hoax..... People eat this crap since the end of 1940&#39;s event. Back in history this was &quot;food&quot; for slaves to keep them weak but yet alive to do the work they were suppose to do. Meat was only for the strong and rich."
"I agree that people should be allowed to do whatever as long as it doesnt hurt others. HOWEVER, this is harmful. It gives the impression that being morbidly obese is fun and you will be happy. It encourages people to not eat healthy or work out and to become obese. Its not okay"
"No way he&#39;s happy in his body. He feels like shit every single day, has trouble going to the bathroom, getting in and out of bed, basic things we all take for granted."
"The problem here is that (in the UK, where this was filmed) morbid obesity does hurt other people. We have public healthcare and it isn&#39;t very good. Every fat person who requires medical resources is taking those resources away from someone else who needs them.<br>IMO self-inflicted health conditions caused by things like obesity or smoking should not be covered by public healthcare."
I like your content but you talk too much. More of the clip needed before you analyse.
Disgusting more than anything
This girl is using this man living her best life
"&quot; Orange juice is pretty healthy &quot;<br>Depend on the frequency and quantity , even water can be deadly in absurde numbers of takes"
also &quot;i&#39;m not ashamed of being fat...but i&#39;m not going to tell you how much i weigh&quot; Thats the epitomy of shame
"I love piers Morgan, that is real news"
How did they get money for all of this food?
"Once again, Asmongold reminds us all what the Dunning-Kruger effect is. :D"
"I think the moment hes had kids, his obesity isnt only his personal problem anymore because obviously as a dad you are the primary role model for your kids. If you dont have shame about something thats so negativly impactful to you, weak people would give in easily. Im confident shame is a driving motivator for many people to NOT become fat, shame is good. I think on  the topic of mental health in this subject would simply be representative if you asked a formerly thin person gone fat, and a formerly fat person gone thin about how they feel about it and see whos gonna be most enthusiastic and inspirational speaking about their journey"
"Yeah, I knwo everything that was bad in the internet since 1999, all the shit that was flowing in 4chan and lime wire and torrents. you people don&#39;t know LOL"
"Let&#39;s make it clear, they&#39;re getting views cuz of his wife. Nothing else lol"
"I weigh 110kg and have been overweight for many years. I used to be slim, but my current belly has significantly reduced my quality of life both health-wise and in terms of self-esteem, especially around women. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. I believe those who defend this lifestyle are in denial, unable to see their own potential to make positive changes."
"My wife is a doctor. I can tell you that obese people cost everyone a lot. They require way more care, surgeries, prescriptions, and as such are part of why our insurance premiums are so high and our doctors are so stressed."
"such an L take on this, we already have wayy too much data to know its a bad idea. Just like smoking we put restrictions on it after over 50 years of data accumulated from hundreds of thousands of people. I mean yes leave them alone to being fat but to assume that the market will correct itself when the media is selective about what is censored and reported on.. its like &quot;hey casualties will happen unnecessarily because they have the freedom to hurt themselves&quot;. Change it from being obese to cutting yourself / blood letting like they did back in the day for whiter skin. Its just like of course its a bad idea. Which i dont think he denies but the way he seems to not only dismiss but to say leave them alone and celebrate their freedom to do it on a platform that they clearly accelerate the issue. His take like many others is a very self centric way of thinking versus the community way which is obviously how humans live in 2 simultaneous parallels."
"Thats not just fat, its full on rotund"
"she is 100% cheating on him, I bet u they dont have DNA test about if he is the Real Dad of the child."
"Amongold only got on the internet in grade 4 or 5? Dammn, my dad was in tech, and we had two phone lines, one for dial-up. I started using a PC at 5 years old and first time I remember connecting to the net I was 6 or 7 (1997/98) had my own PC by the time I was 8...<br>I&#39;ve seen some shit."
Says  Piers Morgan with his double chin...
On the topic for the shaming. Bro i got made fun of for having a spiderman lunchbox and for loving star wars and i was in the 5th grade elementary school. Complete bs
"people ofc should have the freedom to do what they want, but that doesnt mean its good. its objectively selfish for someone with kids to be that fat knowing they&#39;ll die young and leave their kids without a father.  its great when you can be age 80 and your mom and dad are still alive and healthy (as one can be) at age 100, and your kids are 60, their kids are 40, their kids are 20, their kids are newborns. its the whole concept of wanting to have kids when you&#39;re still young and healthy so you can go out and play football with them, go on hikes etc, and let them live most of their lives without the trauma of having dead parents. <br>being 15 and having your dad die of obesity is terrible."
"Holy shit he sounds exactly like James Corden<br><br>Also at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=688"">11:28</a> was she just about to say &quot;that the fat fucks&quot; lol<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=803"">13:23</a> &quot;bigger problem&quot; heh"
All she want is his life insurance. lol
Surprising that most people don’t realize Zack’s been playing one of the most degenerate games out there for YEARS and learned all this madman’s knowledge through the player base 💀
"They are making a lot of money, and when he dies from health problems. Its all her money."
"That&#39;s only noon too🤣🤣🤣<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=106"">1:46</a>."
"I&#39;m 46, if I die tomorrow that&#39;s ok. That is really sad........"
is she still alive?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxGEJqLEk2c&amp;t=420"">7:00</a> Learned helplessness meets a defeatist attitude meets a self fulfilling prophecy."
She says she is younger than him like that&#39;s a brag
64 bmi....holy...moly....sick...sick...
Being overweight and obese isn’t the same thing. One is not making weight for you specific age and height but can still be healthy( Over) and one is plain nasty(obese)
she seems out if it
95% failure rate for diets? lol She&#39;s delusional
Geez
I bet she spends as much on food in a week than I do in a month! I eat once a day.
his co host is so brainless lol
Who saw the elephant in the room.🦣🐘
Doesn&#39;t the fashion industry celebrate anorexia?!
Life isn&#39;t fair &amp; isn&#39;t suppose to be

i have a pet pig for mein own amusement
Let this woman be…. Unfortunately she won’t survive to see 60 😢
"Angelina, can you take over the healthcare insurance companies 😂"
"Change the healthcare system pierce , get a clue , please 😊"
"Yes , I think it’s wonderful  she’s on tv , she’s fine , let’s take the healthcare companies who know with dna manipulation, everyone can live a healthy weight and help them change the system to help this young actress, not tell her our healthcare system is a massive joke in the ununited  states , cause we’ve known that forever 😊"
Chloe also has pumped up lips which look ridiculous… natural is best.
"We once had a patient similar to her size requiring us to ship her to nearby Zoo for CT scan because the patient can&#39;t fit into CT scanner.<br>They do have higher risk of dying, but that&#39;s their call if they want to die."
Couch cushion
Sad!
Sad that she&#39;s even agreed to an interview... it&#39;s embarrassing and pointless 🫣😔
5 years later and her IG is deplorable. It’s really sick. I wonder what happened that she treats her body and mind like this?
She is built like a tanker
People need to STOP ENCOURAGING MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH ISSUES JUST TO MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL BETTER. IT&#39;S P*****G ME OFF
I watched The whale last night... Just sayin...
Moo
What music video was she in
"I have been suffering from insomnia pretty much as long as i can remember..<br>I am 25, i like to workout but.. I can see how lack of sleep is really starting to effect me.<br>Sometimes it even causes panic attacks. They are mild but... They make me feel like i just might randomly.. Die.<br>And i feel like i can&#39;t really control it. Sure i could do a little more to improve my sleep but.. I am just saying i struggle..<br>I wouldNEVER go out there and say tha suffering with insomnia is fine and we should just accept it when someone is constantly tired.. This isn&#39;t normal.. There are many health issues related to insomnia, it scares me. And yet i don&#39;t see people glorifying it. It&#39;s different, sure but... It&#39;s an unhealthy thing too. Why is it fine to encourage unhealthy eating but not fineto encourage staying up for too long?<br>Why is this a thing?"
46???
Pierce is not obverweight at all she is dangetously overweight and could have jeart attack but why leave overweight people out of things because of how she looks but she didd try and take focus on him to take off her
"Oh… g<br>Go on a diet, it is like having cancer and denying chemotherapy"
Obesity is cursed simple
"Piers, you got mad at the British guy who wanted Russian women because of the obesity rate.  Don&#39;t get angry at him; why would he want to stay around for this?"
People are given a choice they can follow or not. I chose to check out of this fruitless debate
"The woman, as an adult, deserves respect in her decisions.<br><br>Conversely, accountability should rest with parents, the food industry, and marketing ethics for fostering obesity in children. Children lack agency in what they consume, and these influences can set lifelong patterns of unhealthy habits."
"I’m overweight - not quite as much as her but overweight nonetheless - but I can’t stand the hypocrisy of these ‘plus-size’ models, if they were stick-thin we’d rightly be calling it out for promoting unhealthy and unrealistic body image, but being hugely overweight is ok??"
She doesn&#39;t have to talk to know she&#39;s American!
A model for mobility scooters maybe 😂 lol cow
"Watch out for DR NOW, 600 lb life"
When GMB was good
You look 60
She does not understand that this is not about her.  Looking for ways to fight back with incoherent arguments only makes here look and sound naive
She’s deep in denial 😞
How can a lady go from &quot;My 600lb Sister&quot;  to a &quot;model?&quot; BA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is funny
"Piers, you are so spot on!<br>We really need you in Sweden! To be able to hear these thoughts we have to turn to s c &#39;alternative media&#39; - but without debate...<br><br>How dare you express what almost everyone thinks?😅<br><br>Love from Sweden!❤"
Piers looks good. This woman in red is a human tick.
Good to finally see a appearance sence your last one holding princess Leia captive in Star Wars
"Excuses,🙄 Go work out"
I cant believe it&#39;s not butter .
Trump 2024
Piers….220??? Sir add that 40lbs to your weight
She is dead 😂
"😂 emphasising the word BIG in that question, made my day"
"Well you are celebrating anorexic models, who are losing hair and teeth right? So what’s the difference"
"I watched a lot of guests here and this guest goes ad hominem. In the chess game of logic , this guest lost big time"
64.6 BMI is beyond crazy!!!
Is the cow still alive?
THE WORLD IS GOING BACK TO FRONT
&quot;model&quot; 😂😂😂
Piers has a beautiful  build very fit person she can&#39;t  reach for any thing else. Sad comment lady
A model for what? Dumper trucks?
So now barnyard cattles are called Models too ?
The eyebrows on the “Model” are a felony too!
I think she got hungry just from sitting there and having to talk more than she usually would. lol 😂
He’s 60 pounds over weight
One person is intelligent on this panel. Not either women.
The nerve this woman has is ... well huge.
In answer to his question about him reflecting a clinically dangerous weight. He is. Anything over weight is still clinically dangerous even if it is slightly. So yeah na he really can&#39;t talk
she is delusional making fun of not looking fun at all...BODY POSITIVITY MOVEMENT IS THE ONLY MOVEMENT THAT DOESNT REQUIRE TO MOVE
she really thought she <b>ate</b> after this
"Piers, if there are tv journalist like you , then anything is possible"
She likes eating what&#39;s the problem with that LOL
"I am judgemental against overweight people. Not proud of it, it&#39;s an automatic emotional reaction."
Diet has a 95 percent failure rate? Examples <br><br>She failed to put the box of doughnuts away<br>She failed to order a salad<br>She failed to choose water over soda<br>She failed to not over eat <br>She failed to take morning walks<br>She failed to pass on the butter
friendly fire isnt tolerated
Guys the girl coudnt make it up the stairs herself... Simple. piers is right lets face it
Nobody 600 lbs is a model for anything except donuts
Obesity = sickness
Jus&quot; buy a LARGE WIDE Angle Lens!
Moo 🐮
BIG backlash.  Who did she eat?
🐘🐘🐘🐘 borne as a 😮
I like piers
My phone screen is bent down to the right now
She said” I did it to get paid” 😂😂😂
Need Katie Hopkins on this pannel.
how the F can people be so lazy
Don&#39;t skinny people die of heart attack.
Get some help there’s too many options for weight loss and to be healthy is the quality of life that you live not longevity
&quot;Diets are 95% failure rate&quot;.  Yup that is why you don&#39;t diet.  You change your lifestyle.  Eating less calories than your daily requirement is medical science fact in losing weight.
"Bet if she walked down the street in that dress kids would be running behind her screaming &quot;HEY KOOL-ADE!!!   <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ssIfY7OFG5OykQOpn4CQCw""></a>"
Let’s face it… nobody WANTS to look like that <br>Literally nobody
"Everyone deserves love but think about it, you hardly ever seen obese elderly people. I think that says a lot."
"She is delusional!  Thank you, Piers."
His wife encourages it. She likes him that big. It’s a sexual fetish.
"As an obese woman with walking issues due to car accidents without medical because ex was drunk, it is hard to lose weulight and i think its disgusting to glorify obesity. Its hard it hurts"
They are raking in ten thousand pounds a month so it is all about the money.
Does Piers Morgan ever get through an interview without talking across people and not letting other people finish their sentences?
I feel I’m either 100% with piers Morgan or 100% against him. This time I’m 100% with him
blair looks like she did one of those uncanny makeup trends
That’s his wife???!!! 😮🤨🧐
Piers Morgan should invited nick avocado to the show
Margot Squares
I used to like sweets!
&quot;plus size&quot;.. its called fat
Fatty
Jackson Sarah Young Jeffrey Walker Jennifer
Went to a party<br>I ate all night<br>I ate sixteen hamburgers <br>And I started up a fight<br>But now I am jaded<br>You&#39;re out of luck<br>I&#39;m rolling down the stairs<br>Too fat to work…….
Weak men are dangerous
How is he a father............must have one humungous penii
"Being happy in one&#39;s skin, is not the same as flouting being out of shape.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;s doing that.  He&#39;s just being happy and himself.  If he could lose weight, I&#39;m sure he would.  We don&#39;t anyone regarding of whether we agree w/ their state of being, to be unhappy in their own skin."
No way missionary goes on in that bedroom
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iPqwf01s64&amp;t=382"">6:22</a> theirs that insecurity I knew was there. He projects it on to his wife. Got it 👍🏾"
Well someone&#39;s punching above his weight...😮😮
Is funny the person that have debating how all that surgery on her face
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iPqwf01s64&amp;t=48"">0:48</a> &quot;Really? That&#39;s what people are watching?&quot; My thoughts exactly."
The fact that he is promoting obesity is shocking I was near 20 stone and had a shock at the doctors and within a year I have dropped over 4 stone by completely Changing my diet and walking more if he feels happy in his own skin fair enough that&#39;s up to him but promoting junk food and bad diets aren&#39;t right I have been down the same road I was living of junk food takeouts dinners enough to feed 2 people plus dessert afterwards only going to work and home nothing in-between days of work all i done was eat all day and I know it&#39;s hard to change but it just takes something to click now im eating 3 times a day and haven&#39;t had any takeouts apart from when I&#39;m in Spain in over a year if your happy in your own body fair enough but don&#39;t promote bad diets or junk food
Internet has killed most things
Genetics 🤣
Well done Piers
"If you google old fat people and hit images, not too many pictures show up. That says it all."
Why
"I liked piers but lately he is just being rude,always right  and just generally a 😂"
Why would they bring in some random trans dude to talk about this lol who cares
"This interview was badly handled, Piers could have allowed the man to speak more rather than talking over him and doing too much"
That Blaire White person has a Michael Jackson nose replica on her face. <br>What&#39;s going on in the world Lol
Maybe he can rent himself out as a  blimp character in the Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Parade. Or have &#39;GOODYEAR&quot; painted on his side so he can float over the Rose Bowl on New Year&#39;s Day.
that thing had babies with that lady ?
"People choose themselves what they put in their body, like if you seen a crackhead promoting crack, you wouldn&#39;t start taking crack, leave this guy alone ffs"
"What&#39;s funny is that there have been actual studies that have been done that show when you work out your body releases endorphins which is basically a dopamine rush, making you feel good. It doesn&#39;t make sense to not workout."
His wife is so cute people say you need to stay lean and muscular to get girls n look at him😂
Holy cow
"Why not promote healthy eating, show how to eat sensibly, exercise regularly"
They better leave my girl Abby out of this- not that it should matter but her account is now being used to document her weightloss journey
Blair White is very beautiful even though it cost a lot of money to get there!
lol she won’t stay with him for long
His wife is kinda bad
This is why aliens don&#39;t visit us....
"I agree with Piers, but if he’s not even going to let him speak, then he shouldn’t invite him on his show."
I think I&#39;m moving to the UK we&#39;re truth and facts are aloud
Start your day with some brain
That&#39;s his wife...? She&#39;s gotta be mental.
I&#39;m here one year later but I doubt the Fatvocate -fat advocate is.
The bigger you get. The more your heart works.
craig
fat and obese are not the same
Thats why glutonny became a sin.
"OK, so as anybody ever heard of the dangers of botox? 🤣 She&#39;s there talking about the dangers of obesity."
She came for the fame and stayed for the life insurance.
He just influenced me to go to the gym
Why would you record yourself eating a Reese&#39;s peanut butter cup? People are weird af
The one time I agree with Pierce.
"Hey fatty bom bom, chill out on those cheese burgers and you might be able to spend some of that money and be with your family"
Piers should have Nikokado Avocado on his show
He must earn some serious coin if he&#39;s able to pull that bird
What a pointless segment. That was just inviting some dude on to berate him and his wife about his weight.
Nothing like being a big pile of s*** and trying to make it look cool as an influencer
"Denying the actual definition of what you are is part of the whole problem, you are denying you have a problem. &quot;Well, let&#39;s not call it..... &lt;insert every adjective that describes you to a T.&gt;&quot;<br>Also, pretty sure his gf has a fat fetish."
"I mean.. Piers is also fat and he was eating burgers on his program with celebration, so I find it funny that he is the one to say what is healthy and what is not."
The look in his wife’s eyes you can see she is waiting for him to choke on a donut
Reject modernity.  Embrace masculinity
the american done my head in dissing george but shes got thousands worth of cosmetics on her face
425
"the wife is a feeder, she will feed him till she klills him and then move on"
His favorite band must be OB/CD
His wife is like Jill Biden. Complicit
Over 30 stone
At least George is a real person unlike Blaire. She looked like a doll with her plastered on make up and her lipstick placed higher than her upper lip. Give me real people like George and not these fakes.
One of the rare occasions where I totally agree with Piers.
"This was such a misfire, both Piers and Blaire (wild choice for a guest btw) and all the comments are just talking around this guy purely because of his weight. <br><br>He clearly said he’s not proud of his weight, he wouldn’t recommend for anyone to gain weight like he did, that he appreciates the health risks and that there is an issue with obesity in the UK, and that he’s currently working to lose weight!! <br><br>His videos are for fun and (now) money. He’s literally making fun of himself in his videos. <br><br>Why is everyone talking like this is a body positivity activist! He’s trying to lose weight, the body positivity cult would crucify him! <br><br>It was like Piers wasn’t even interviewing the person in front of him, he wasn’t listening at all. They literally said he was working on losing weight and Piers not long after says “why don’t you go on a fitness/weight loss journey and show that?” ????"
Those food tic toks gave me ptsd discusting
"These people just benefit of the age we live in, even thought none of it is thanks to them... If it were just 1000 or even a 100 years ago, they&#39;d be the first one to go. There&#39;s no place in nature for this, natural selection would deal with those very very quickly"
"Nothing funny about it, he is in total denial 😂"
108.9 on your dial!
"Well most Trump supporters fall into the obese category.  I know, because I’ve been to 3 of his rallies.   🤷🏻"
Is that craig from ppl just do nothing
His wife is fine 👌 But he’s 🤮 🤮
Interesting topic. I just wish Pierre’s didn’t constantly talk over guests like he does in this video
Fat influencers should not be allowed to be around children
Is that Harvey&#39;s dad? (Katie Price)
One of George’s influencers insulted me for being slim.
"Private health care doesn’t cover A&amp;E or ambulances, or intensive care of any form. <br><br>Nice try, but you can’t use that to get off the hook. And in all fairness, there’s a high chance you’ll use all 3 as you’re one breath away from a heart attack or stroke….."
"Planet Earth is done, doomed and finished."
Its just immature hes in his late 30s just grow up and get a proper job 😂😂
"its a spit in the face for people like me with psoriasis (which can&#39;t be cured), who has occasional flare ups, that these obese people wanna share this body positivity movement with people who actually have unfixable circumstances"
Pounds in excess pounds 😂😂😂 that one got me😂😂
Piers is honestly being so disrespectful but he usually is. I agree with some of what he’s saying but the way he’s communicating is going to make people not want to do anything. They may even do the opposite in spite of his rude comments
There’s no way that’s his wife bro she’s way too hot for him
They make money getting fat and then they make money losing weight. Come on people. Contribute to the f ing world.
he makes piers morgan look thin
"Just clicked on the video to say it&#39;s unfair to show the frame of the obese man on a wider frame than that of piers. May not have been intentional but it shows so much meaning of the two. A lack of balance, such as the conversation and showcasing more of the body of the man in doing so. Piers is not a healthy looking man either, and to shoot both subjects this way is already putting in a negative impression. Bad journalism."
As said by the slim and slender piers morgan 😭🤣
Heart attack doesn’t care about you body positively! Diabetes doesn’t care about that!
Im more stunned that he got a girl like that and had a kid with her.....clearly money talks
Feel bad for that girl dude probably stunk
The bad effect of obesity on the body is too much consequence in having the same lifestyle as him well I guess he is earning money and he is living a yolo life
Blaire has no right to talk with that plastic face.
If you can be so easily be influenced by someone then you must be weak minded to begin with.
fat people should pay more.....insurance as well
How is paying for an Xtra seat raising them prices for others? Here he goes again running his mouth while clueless.
It&#39;s not as bad as an overweight woman trying to give me diet advice and telling me I need to be eating vegetables (I love vegetables so I don&#39;t need to be encouraged) But she was completely unaware that she was bigger than I am. I&#39;m not that big. I didn&#39;t ask her for advice! But people are always trying to analyze things that don&#39;t involve them at all and they know nothing about.
No discrimination.  Get your head out of the chicken bucket.  I&#39;m a big man 6&#39;5&quot; 285 lbs.  I fly either business or first class.  I don&#39;t whine about it.
"When it pertains to women, this is what *I think*:
<br>
<br>*Thicc*: female proportions and the curves are a bit more exagerated/bodyfat-augmented than average.
<br>*Fat*: You have a BMI of &gt; 29 and a fat percentage of &gt;30% and most importantly out of proportion
<br>*Plus-size*: All your features (incl muscles, joints, etc) are bigger than average, but you still see the female silhouette because of good fat distribution
<br>*Big*: fat
<br>*Plump*:  average fat% but BMI &gt;27 and lacking proportion
<br>*chubby*: plus-size but petite
<br>*curvy*: plus-size or thicc
<br>
<br>Fat is the only one here <b>I think</b> is objectively unhealthy and mostly unattractive"
Kids have become ultimate brats!
She needs too use boat travel they can accommodate 😅
No how about losing some weight so you can fit into one seat and not be a safety hazard to everyone on your flight.
It’s all effin ridiculous.
Children and young people are so thin skinned nowadays.
"confused, if you&#39;re offended she said &quot;girls&quot; then you should be offended by calling a school a &quot;girls&quot; school? HYPOCRISY"
"Sitting next to an oversized whale makes me lose my dignity! What an a$$, and a gigantic one, at that!"
"I never thought I&#39;d live to see one that washed up so far inland. 😧 Life Lesson: If you don&#39;t want to attract mockery, don&#39;t try to push your delusions on others."
"All plus sized people should be given absolutely no benefits or special treatment for being fat whatsoever, in fact, ban them from all flights."
The time is coming when the label &quot;racist&quot; will be something to be proud of.I am proud to carry that label.
"Plus size 😂 How is that nicer than just saying fat? Or, more accurately,  morbidly obese."
"I mostly arrive last in most areas , but I try not to bug people about it."
Too bad…. Go on a diet. I’m skinny maybe I should get half off huh
well we werent the one making her plus size.
Today&#39;s generation is challenging reality itself
Then LOOSE weight‼️‼️
Tall people don’t get more leg room unless they buy a business or first-class seat. They can’t change their height. FAT people CAN work on changing their weight.
if she doesn&#39;t identify as a girl she/he/it should be banned from ONLY girls school....
That&#39;s why airplanes have cargo  area 😅😅
"Why call them Plus Size?  Just say Fat, that’s what they are"
But where does Piers find these obnoxious people who can&#39;t differentiate between reality and stupidity? And that woman should not travel in Airplanes and even if she does then she should check in as luggage and not passenger
"I’m the first to agree that airplane seats are too small. But until or unless that is ever resolved, instead of being entitled, maybe have some compassion for the person who is being squished up next to you?"
"That happened to my sons bus driver once. He would get to the school and dismiss the “ladies first” and then the boys. Of course, you had to have that one student make a stink over it and the bus driver got in trouble over it."
It is the first time I agree with him 100%.
Ahh Diabetty<br><br>Run or she&#39;ll eat your babies
Slob.
"Dear lord. They have to pump an extra ton of fuel into the plane to carry those land-whales so they already add 1.5 tons to the plane. Girl, ...there are physical limits. They are only two or three all-you-can-eat buffets away from needing a C5-Galaxy. What will happen then? A petition for a second transport rack?"
The world has gone bananas!  This generation has no respect for authority.  All thin non-binary is rubbish!   Teachers these days have no rights.  STFU <del>-Love Piers Morgan--</del>
The select few…are the few members of fat acceptance who are still alive… not the ones of average size.
Perhaps the airlines should provide accommodations on their freighters  for these entitled buffalo gals.
Agree
Can’t argue with stupidity .
Well she must always get double at McDonald’s .
When did being a girl or woman become a dirty word
If people have to pay extra for heavy luggage then obese people should do the same thing
"I can remember a time when people flew they dressed properly they behaved themselves and if someone behaved badly they were shocked and horrified, today people act like they don&#39;t have a single living brain cell."
How did the teacher know the girl identified as a boy ffs
Its just pathetic
"Im surprised she is allowed to travel on regular planes, she should go on cargo!"
"Love the university clip, gives me hope"
Billy o Reilly has let himself go
When I send air cargo I pay by the kg - why should that girl that likes eating not be treated as cargo
Naah you should pay extra
Rancors go in the hold
LIBBY WOMAN
"LOL this is exactly what happens when people are allowed access to the internet, the delusion is they think it gives them authority or entitlement. I wish I&#39;d studied sociology at school. Because cognitively people are seriously struggling with sanity and it&#39;s having a detrimental effect on society."
She recommends concrete steps bc that’s all that can support her😂
Obesity is not the airlines fault it’s yours
So the fat girl gets extra seats. I bet she’ll say something like skinny people should share seats
There are those planes that crate up hippopotamus’ to move them around. She should use that.
"The name, plus size , gives relief for pigs, to being pigs."
"I wanted go to journalist school, then I was educated. I got a butt lift, Botox, and transcranial  magnetic stimulation. Now I don’t offend anyone. It’s a thing."
Thought ‘fly’ meant beautiful. Going to stay home.
I want to know where his plug goes
He wants to know where man tampons go.
How about a nice seat in the cargo area.
US Universities have lost their quality and credibility
One word: salad
"Just as your carry on luggage has to fit certain dimensions your body should also fit in the seat without spill over and discomfort to other fliers.  If this woman is too large for the seat then put this woman, and her luggage, on a cargo flight and charge her fare by the pound.  I am tired of people who can&#39;t live by the rules demanding special treatment."
The first one was wild
Lose weight
Everybody is entitled to dignity and respect.<br>But not two seats for the price of one.<br>America has been socially assaulted by the left for years now. We are a tolerant people and have done our best to accommodate various segments of society that are out of the norm.<br>This tolerance has served to enable the extremists. And America&#39;s moderates have had enough. November&#39;s presidential election will serve to show less about Trump and more a horrified disenfranchisement with Biden.
Lose weight 😅
I’m a fat guy and I couldn’t agree more! Over the last six years I’ve lost 150 pounds. Before I lost weight I bought two seats on a plane. My fat. My cost.
Dont be PLUS sizef then
Ummmm…so airlines should install sofas for fat girls???
She&#39;s so healthy that she needs oxygen and can&#39;t even walk down the length of a plane without a wheelchair
"I&#39;d never support that petition. Obese people should pay double. They cause more fuel consumption, thus more pollution etc. Etc."
she looks like an massively over wieght brett cooper
This whole „The majority has to conform to the minority.“ will never work. It‘s an unsustainable fad.
Whenever someone screams „Your racism is showing.“ I have to laugh.
I feel sorry for the passengers next to the lady
"Make sure the travel industry serves everyone not just a select few? Your part of the select few they have to go so far out of their way for, cus you can&#39;t walk to airport gates, can&#39;t carry luggage, can&#39;t sit in a normal seat, probably can&#39;t sleep in standard hotel beds, can&#39;t sit in any sort of hot weather, can go on any excursions without assistance and special measures. <br><br>Yet you have the gaul to demand more."
&#39;Mr Bo&#39;sun; pass me my largest harpoon!&#39;

I identify as a fridge.<br>Full of beer. 😜
Put the happy meals down.
"Being unhealthy and proud isnt a reason to be unhealthy. Youre ashamed of yourself and are grasping at straws to feel validated because you&#39;re unwilling to change. <br>This includes trans - if youre unwilling to change, to realize that how you feel isnt a moral justification to change the definition of what a woman is nor to force irresponsible opinions on the rest of society. Lgbtq+++++ is just becoming an excuse to wave your hand and be however you wanna be. Male rapist to women tofay, identifies as a woman tomorrow, can use womans restrooms and lockers.<br>Children? Its confusing af for everyone forming an identity as it is, now you wanna add a total disregard of social and moral standards? Lmao wow.<br>Tomorrow im gonna identify as your aunt."
Pierce: Because you’re a Beast<br><br>Me: you just proved their point of bullying.
High demand anybody with obesity to lose the weight and stop telling other to accept them for being fat.fst is a unhealthy State for the body why should we have to accept it
Do we need larger exit rows are I doubt she would get out.
Waiting for the “we need a larger luggage allowance because our clothes are bigger”
I do not want to sit next to you.
"“Plus size”- typical obfuscating euphemism.<br>Medical term is : morbidly obese. <br>Eat less, weigh less. Eat more, buy two tickets. Accountability for one’s actions is good for one’s mental health."
&quot; PLUS SIZE &quot; Means Porker!
Kevin is the problem and definitely not part of the solution…
Love your work Piers…
The woman is grotesque with a total lack of self control.
They need more seats? What they need to do is lose weight.
At least this woman never hacked a murder victims phone.
Ever notice that really obese people have a permanent frown on both  sides of their mouths? Lol i only see it on fat people
Piers Morgan is &quot;ludicrous.&quot;
I think she might require the whole plane to herself -- which sounds completely fair to me.  My concern would be that she might eat the plane -- and the entire crew -- before they have a chance to do their jobs.
Airline seats should generally be bigger.
"Who cares, whatever happened to individualism"
"Shame has value when it comes from within, you dont need more from the outside. The argument that smoking is also bad or &quot;other stuff is bad too&quot; isnt an argument, you should try to be healthy where you find it worth while since being 100% perfect is impossible. Glorification of morbid obesity should not be allowed, just as we dont allow people to glorify drugs or gambling, obviously. Insane to me people have this &quot;i can do whatever i want because its my body&quot; mentality when you have children who depend and rely on you, absolute nonsense of people just justifying what they do because they dont want to think of actual consequences. I think these messages like that prey on people in vulnerable states who are looking for any reason to keep doing what they are doing instead of getting the possible help for the underlying problems they have."
The thing is peirs is asking a man who is pretending to be a woman if being fat is wrong <br>It&#39;s not something that makes sense
"cmon we all know there&#39;re a lot of people who have fat-fetish to be fair, it take like 1/4 to 1/3 out of all the rule 34 gallery including super fat characters, especially fat furries"

"Coming from someone who was 140lbs over weight, it&#39;s horrible to be that big, and there&#39;s nothing glorious about it. Get off your lazy ass, quit shoveling food down your throat,  and change your life!  I was fat shamed and it was a good thing! I appreciate it!"

"Ah come on guys healthy food is cheaper than fast food and it&#39;s cheaper than THAT AMOUNT of food regardless.<br>Just buy groceries and cook. If your standard for food are delivery apps, then yeah, &quot;healthy&quot; is more expensive."
"Guys, I&#39;ve figured it out. It&#39;s not a fat people fetish, it&#39;s a tactic to speed run inheritance."
The fact that this man managed to make a 21 minute reaction video out of a 7 minute video is insane lmfaoo
Saw the thumbnail on this old video and my first thought was is this guy still alive?
The “meta” for a fat man having an attractive girlfriend or wife is if he has money. That isn’t new or unique. Women mostly just care about money so being fat is nearly inconsequential.
(I do agree on your take with alcohol... this country has a load of alcoholics)
"Correction AsNoitall:  it is NOT a God given right to be obese.  It&#39;s a intentional &quot;devil may care&quot; cause in harming your own body, that God gave you, leading to induced health issues and death.  This IS NOT a God given right.  Killing yourself slowly over-eating foods, and then making a big joke of it.  The wife could care less of the health risk to her husband... as long as she&#39; getting free air-time on TikTok.  It&#39;s a free will choice, yes, but with all the fucked-up people out there, he&#39;s sending the wrong signals or impressions to being fat.  And to that, God does not look kindly on.  You are accountable to God first and for most...."
Let’s do it ? Ok! ✅
"Why do people say eating healthy is expensive, its way cheaper. Even if it wasn&#39;t wouldn&#39;t buying less food, and eating healthy be cheaper."
From all the bad shit you can see and learn from the internet.. there will always be more..
When culture is based on corporate needs.
In my country there is no single unhealthy thing that cost less than healthy food

&quot;Let&#39;s do it&quot;. I&#39;m dying over here😂
Jeez how much work did he get done to look like that?
Also any rational person knows how much he weighs pretty accurately without him saying. Someone of that size is about 700 pounds.
This is just fucking ridiculous at this point some people are fat because the worst type of food for you is the cheapest option growing up keeping fresh fruit and vegies wasn’t cheap for a snack but it was easier to buy a bag of chips and because ur a kid and u don’t know how to tell ur self no so u eat till ur full and then u put the bag of chips away then a few hours later mama makes dinner and u eat till ur full again its not that parents encourage bad eating habits its just i didn’t know how badly my habbits were untill i put some weight on shit happens u can’t say fat is unhealthy because fat is normal its apart of animal kingdom we get fat to hibernate it just extra food storage just loads of people now don’t need a diet they need to fast

Anatole never fails to prove me right
"For tens of thousands of years humans had to work very hard to acquire food. For the majority of our existence we broke even in terms of energy gain vs energy expense with food. The gain was slightly more give the fact that we&#39;re still around, obviously. <br>It&#39;s only for the last couple of decades where food has become so widespread available in extreme abundance, topped off with a capitalistic system who&#39;s single purpose it is to sell the consumer as much as possible, and you got the perfect recipe for a global obesity epidemic. <br>Human&#39;s are literally gorging themselves to death as a result of our own success. We&#39;re not cognitively wired to resist our urges to eat, it&#39;s a result of thousands of years of habit and evolution. What we can do however is become consciously aware of this phenomenon and teach our kids how to responsibly handle food. Which is the exact opposite of body positivity"

"I find it funny, being a fat man myself, is that all those people are the ones ranting on twitter asking for freedom of speech, freedom of whatever, but when it comes to something they disagree, they are all against it.

"Seriously. I dont think its that bad. Most of them die before 50/60 but still pay taxes and contribute to society. If someone has data and statistics that show that most of them dont work because of health issues I will retract this, but these 350 plus pound cases are of the rarer kind, at least in my country.

Sayin that someone who lives until 50&#39;s and die of obesity costs more than someone who lives healthy until thei 90&#39;s are insane.

Absolutely it should be allowed!…..fucking you are hilarious and I love you!!
I love Blair White
Fatfluencers?!
Sad
How do they afford this lifestyle
14 mins in I couldn’t disagree more mate. Unless you were raised in poor Britain in the 90s you have no idea how little we knew about nutrition. Knowbody cared. I didn’t know fruit has sugar till I started a kitchen job at 16. My grandparents used to give us sugar sandwiches if we were hungry cause it tasted like cake and no one could afford cakes. This is real life bro. I’m now 33 and go to great lengths just to maintain a chubby physique and not of over the deep end. I will forever have issues around food now because of that time. That’s why schools try so hard now to teach about healthy eating. Also when I was a kid sugar was in no way a bad thing. Fat was the enemy in all forms.
"Literally the only thing a man should and must eat, is pure natural meat. Veggies and fruits are just a gmo hoax..... People eat this crap since the end of 1940&#39;s event. Back in history this was &quot;food&quot; for slaves to keep them weak but yet alive to do the work they were suppose to do. Meat was only for the strong and rich."
"I agree that people should be allowed to do whatever as long as it doesnt hurt others. HOWEVER, this is harmful. It gives the impression that being morbidly obese is fun and you will be happy. It encourages people to not eat healthy or work out and to become obese. Its not okay"
"No way he&#39;s happy in his body. He feels like shit every single day, has trouble going to the bathroom, getting in and out of bed, basic things we all take for granted."
"The problem here is that (in the UK, where this was filmed) morbid obesity does hurt other people. We have public healthcare and it isn&#39;t very good. Every fat person who requires medical resources is taking those resources away from someone else who needs them.<br>IMO self-inflicted health conditions caused by things like obesity or smoking should not be covered by public healthcare."
I like your content but you talk too much. More of the clip needed before you analyse.
Disgusting more than anything

How did they get money for all of this food?
"Once again, Asmongold reminds us all what the Dunning-Kruger effect is. :D"
"I think the moment hes had kids, his obesity isnt only his personal problem anymore because obviously as a dad you are the primary role model for your kids. If you dont have shame about something thats so negativly impactful to you, weak people would give in easily. Im confident shame is a driving motivator for many people to NOT become fat, shame is good. I think on  the topic of mental health in this subject would simply be representative if you asked a formerly thin person gone fat, and a formerly fat person gone thin about how they feel about it and see whos gonna be most enthusiastic and inspirational speaking about their journey"

"I weigh 110kg and have been overweight for many years. I used to be slim, but my current belly has significantly reduced my quality of life both health-wise and in terms of self-esteem, especially around women. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. I believe those who defend this lifestyle are in denial, unable to see their own potential to make positive changes."
"My wife is a doctor. I can tell you that obese people cost everyone a lot. They require way more care, surgeries, prescriptions, and as such are part of why our insurance premiums are so high and our doctors are so stressed."
"such an L take on this, we already have wayy too much data to know its a bad idea. Just like smoking we put restrictions on it after over 50 years of data accumulated from hundreds of thousands of people. I mean yes leave them alone to being fat but to assume that the market will correct itself when the media is selective about what is censored and reported on.. its like &quot;hey casualties will happen unnecessarily because they have the freedom to hurt themselves&quot;. Change it from being obese to cutting yourself / blood letting like they did back in the day for whiter skin. Its just like of course its a bad idea. Which i dont think he denies but the way he seems to not only dismiss but to say leave them alone and celebrate their freedom to do it on a platform that they clearly accelerate the issue. His take like many others is a very self centric way of thinking versus the community way which is obviously how humans live in 2 simultaneous parallels."

"people ofc should have the freedom to do what they want, but that doesnt mean its good. its objectively selfish for someone with kids to be that fat knowing they&#39;ll die young and leave their kids without a father.  its great when you can be age 80 and your mom and dad are still alive and healthy (as one can be) at age 100, and your kids are 60, their kids are 40, their kids are 20, their kids are newborns. its the whole concept of wanting to have kids when you&#39;re still young and healthy so you can go out and play football with them, go on hikes etc, and let them live most of their lives without the trauma of having dead parents. <br>being 15 and having your dad die of obesity is terrible."
"Holy shit he sounds exactly like James Corden<br><br>Also at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=688"">11:28</a> was she just about to say &quot;that the fat fucks&quot; lol<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=803"">13:23</a> &quot;bigger problem&quot; heh"
All she want is his life insurance. lol
Surprising that most people don’t realize Zack’s been playing one of the most degenerate games out there for YEARS and learned all this madman’s knowledge through the player base 💀
"They are making a lot of money, and when he dies from health problems. Its all her money."
"That&#39;s only noon too🤣🤣🤣<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-neHWuzSXA&amp;t=106"">1:46</a>."
"I&#39;m 46, if I die tomorrow that&#39;s ok. That is really sad........"
is she still alive?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxGEJqLEk2c&amp;t=420"">7:00</a> Learned helplessness meets a defeatist attitude meets a self fulfilling prophecy."
She says she is younger than him like that&#39;s a brag
64 bmi....holy...moly....sick...sick...
Being overweight and obese isn’t the same thing. One is not making weight for you specific age and height but can still be healthy( Over) and one is plain nasty(obese)
she seems out if it
95% failure rate for diets? lol She&#39;s delusional
Geez
I bet she spends as much on food in a week than I do in a month! I eat once a day.
his co host is so brainless lol
Who saw the elephant in the room.🦣🐘
Doesn&#39;t the fashion industry celebrate anorexia?!
Life isn&#39;t fair &amp; isn&#39;t suppose to be
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxGEJqLEk2c&amp;t=240"">4:00</a> 46??? She won’t make it to be a senior citizen"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxGEJqLEk2c&amp;t=186"">3:06</a> sh’s so rude"
i have a pet pig for mein own amusement
Let this woman be…. Unfortunately she won’t survive to see 60 😢
"Angelina, can you take over the healthcare insurance companies 😂"
"Change the healthcare system pierce , get a clue , please 😊"
"Yes , I think it’s wonderful  she’s on tv , she’s fine , let’s take the healthcare companies who know with dna manipulation, everyone can live a healthy weight and help them change the system to help this young actress, not tell her our healthcare system is a massive joke in the ununited  states , cause we’ve known that forever 😊"
Chloe also has pumped up lips which look ridiculous… natural is best.
"We once had a patient similar to her size requiring us to ship her to nearby Zoo for CT scan because the patient can&#39;t fit into CT scanner.<br>They do have higher risk of dying, but that&#39;s their call if they want to die."
Couch cushion
Sad!
Sad that she&#39;s even agreed to an interview... it&#39;s embarrassing and pointless 🫣😔
5 years later and her IG is deplorable. It’s really sick. I wonder what happened that she treats her body and mind like this?
She is built like a tanker
People need to STOP ENCOURAGING MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH ISSUES JUST TO MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL BETTER. IT&#39;S P*****G ME OFF
I watched The whale last night... Just sayin...
Moo
What music video was she in
"I have been suffering from insomnia pretty much as long as i can remember..<br>I am 25, i like to workout but.. I can see how lack of sleep is really starting to effect me.<br>Sometimes it even causes panic attacks. They are mild but... They make me feel like i just might randomly.. Die.<br>And i feel like i can&#39;t really control it. Sure i could do a little more to improve my sleep but.. I am just saying i struggle..<br>I wouldNEVER go out there and say tha suffering with insomnia is fine and we should just accept it when someone is constantly tired.. This isn&#39;t normal.. There are many health issues related to insomnia, it scares me. And yet i don&#39;t see people glorifying it. It&#39;s different, sure but... It&#39;s an unhealthy thing too. Why is it fine to encourage unhealthy eating but not fineto encourage staying up for too long?<br>Why is this a thing?"
46???
Pierce is not obverweight at all she is dangetously overweight and could have jeart attack but why leave overweight people out of things because of how she looks but she didd try and take focus on him to take off her
"Oh… g<br>Go on a diet, it is like having cancer and denying chemotherapy"
Obesity is cursed simple
"Piers, you got mad at the British guy who wanted Russian women because of the obesity rate.  Don&#39;t get angry at him; why would he want to stay around for this?"
People are given a choice they can follow or not. I chose to check out of this fruitless debate
"The woman, as an adult, deserves respect in her decisions.<br><br>Conversely, accountability should rest with parents, the food industry, and marketing ethics for fostering obesity in children. Children lack agency in what they consume, and these influences can set lifelong patterns of unhealthy habits."
"I’m overweight - not quite as much as her but overweight nonetheless - but I can’t stand the hypocrisy of these ‘plus-size’ models, if they were stick-thin we’d rightly be calling it out for promoting unhealthy and unrealistic body image, but being hugely overweight is ok??"
She doesn&#39;t have to talk to know she&#39;s American!
A model for mobility scooters maybe 😂 lol cow
"Watch out for DR NOW, 600 lb life"
When GMB was good
You look 60
She does not understand that this is not about her.  Looking for ways to fight back with incoherent arguments only makes here look and sound naive
She’s deep in denial 😞
How can a lady go from &quot;My 600lb Sister&quot;  to a &quot;model?&quot; BA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!
😂😂😂😂😂😂 this is funny
"Piers, you are so spot on!<br>We really need you in Sweden! To be able to hear these thoughts we have to turn to s c &#39;alternative media&#39; - but without debate...<br><br>How dare you express what almost everyone thinks?😅<br><br>Love from Sweden!❤"
Piers looks good. This woman in red is a human tick.
Good to finally see a appearance sence your last one holding princess Leia captive in Star Wars
"Excuses,🙄 Go work out"
I cant believe it&#39;s not butter .
Trump 2024
Piers….220??? Sir add that 40lbs to your weight
She is dead 😂
"😂 emphasising the word BIG in that question, made my day"
"Well you are celebrating anorexic models, who are losing hair and teeth right? So what’s the difference"
"I watched a lot of guests here and this guest goes ad hominem. In the chess game of logic , this guest lost big time"
64.6 BMI is beyond crazy!!!
Is the cow still alive?
THE WORLD IS GOING BACK TO FRONT
&quot;model&quot; 😂😂😂
Piers has a beautiful  build very fit person she can&#39;t  reach for any thing else. Sad comment lady
A model for what? Dumper trucks?
So now barnyard cattles are called Models too ?
The eyebrows on the “Model” are a felony too!
I think she got hungry just from sitting there and having to talk more than she usually would. lol 😂
He’s 60 pounds over weight
One person is intelligent on this panel. Not either women.
The nerve this woman has is ... well huge.
In answer to his question about him reflecting a clinically dangerous weight. He is. Anything over weight is still clinically dangerous even if it is slightly. So yeah na he really can&#39;t talk
she is delusional making fun of not looking fun at all...BODY POSITIVITY MOVEMENT IS THE ONLY MOVEMENT THAT DOESNT REQUIRE TO MOVE
she really thought she <b>ate</b> after this
"Piers, if there are tv journalist like you , then anything is possible"
She likes eating what&#39;s the problem with that LOL
"I am judgemental against overweight people. Not proud of it, it&#39;s an automatic emotional reaction."
Diet has a 95 percent failure rate? Examples <br><br>She failed to put the box of doughnuts away<br>She failed to order a salad<br>She failed to choose water over soda<br>She failed to not over eat <br>She failed to take morning walks<br>She failed to pass on the butter
friendly fire isnt tolerated
Guys the girl coudnt make it up the stairs herself... Simple. piers is right lets face it
Nobody 600 lbs is a model for anything except donuts
Obesity = sickness
Jus&quot; buy a LARGE WIDE Angle Lens!
Moo 🐮
BIG backlash.  Who did she eat?
🐘🐘🐘🐘 borne as a 😮
I like piers
My phone screen is bent down to the right now
She said” I did it to get paid” 😂😂😂
Need Katie Hopkins on this pannel.
how the F can people be so lazy
Don&#39;t skinny people die of heart attack.
Get some help there’s too many options for weight loss and to be healthy is the quality of life that you live not longevity
&quot;Diets are 95% failure rate&quot;.  Yup that is why you don&#39;t diet.  You change your lifestyle.  Eating less calories than your daily requirement is medical science fact in losing weight.
"Bet if she walked down the street in that dress kids would be running behind her screaming &quot;HEY KOOL-ADE!!!   <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/ssIfY7OFG5OykQOpn4CQCw""></a>"
Let’s face it… nobody WANTS to look like that <br>Literally nobody
"Everyone deserves love but think about it, you hardly ever seen obese elderly people. I think that says a lot."
"She is delusional!  Thank you, Piers."
His wife encourages it. She likes him that big. It’s a sexual fetish.
"As an obese woman with walking issues due to car accidents without medical because ex was drunk, it is hard to lose weulight and i think its disgusting to glorify obesity. Its hard it hurts"
They are raking in ten thousand pounds a month so it is all about the money.

Yall fuck ricegum jake paul is more better and he has more subscribers and fuck all ricegums fans bye motherfukers
the first like!
You suck
I finally know what it says and I&#39;m like WHAT MY LITTLE COUSIN WAS LISTENING TO THIS
good
Woooohooo
I looove this song
It&#39;s more of a loser kind of way.. so that makes it 100% fine!
Lmfao I was waiting for this one
I commented on her apology and my comment was the only one that didn’t get any likes 💀
She dug her own grave with this one
"I think your the uncle of packgod, your a roaster too, am i wrong?"
"&quot;lets supersize, the Mcdonalds fries&quot; was probably the hardest line anyone has ever heard."
It&#39;s been a year now... Wow
&quot;misinformation&quot;
Ngl Moist is a roast king
You look like a homeless dude.
she did a terrible apology and even worse the lyrics don&#39;t make any sense she made the music industry and humanity mad thats just impressive
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyIKCv4AnB4&amp;t=373"">6:13</a> just a timestamp for my favorite part"
what eventually happened to her?
hawking a what?? tu- tu- tuahh..
I love choclate waffle
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyIKCv4AnB4&amp;t=20"">0:20</a> dog has been spotted"
It&#39;s abundantly clear that Gen Z is pathologically out of touch with reality.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyIKCv4AnB4&amp;t=34"">0:34</a> what happened to the dog?"
she looks like a walten files character
"Remember back when we saw Logan Paul’s apology and thought, “No one can do worse than this.” 💀"
The best thing we got out of this is a megagonefree cover
this hurted all them victims
"nah i could not watch the video till the end <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI""></a>"

Already making a song to apologise shows that u r not taking shit seriously
"hey, its my first time here, but man have you earned my respect"
She’s the female version of EDP445 P Diddy R.Kelly and Dan Snihender she doesn’t want to take accountability for her own actions she’s a PDF
"All I hear is &#39;trauma&#39;, &#39;harm&#39;, &#39;victims&#39; etc.. what horrible thing did she do?"
DEFACATION STATION KILLED ME
The singing is actually pretty good ngl

"I&#39;ve been following this story since a little while after the allegations came out, but I never saw Charlie&#39;s take on it. I used to be subscribed to her vlog channel and I remember at one point there were videos she uploaded where she couldn&#39;t talk because she had a node on her vocal chords that could have caused her serious vocal damage and would have prevented her from ever singing and performing again. Is it wrong for me to wish that actually happened under the want that this video never happened?"

"My favourite part is when she says “They said I couldn’t say what I wanted to say but never that I couldn’t sing what I want to say” And then goes on to stop singing and talk about her gobeldygook then sings her little chorus then starts talking, Over and over and then my ears are free from torture"
Imagine Siennna Mae dancing while Coleen sings
She should get together with Featureman and fly away off of yt.

It pisses me off that instead of actually taking accountability (not singing about it but not doing it), she&#39;s basically saying she didnt do it when theres proof. But this specific part of the song that i linked just pisses me off the most because now shes basically calling us the bad people and victimizing herself the most. Fuck this"

This wasn&#39;t an apology. This was a murder
"See, this is why Jenna Marbles is a good person. She didn&#39;t downplay any of what happened that led to her apologizing, she didn&#39;t blame anyone, she didn&#39;t defend her actions, she simply and earnestly apologized and sought to validate those who were hurt and better herself. She did the right thing and she didn&#39;t victimize herself or blame anyone. She knew what she did was wrong and wanted to better herself. She also didn&#39;t apologize to gain good faith back, she simply wanted to apologize to those she hurt and validate them. She did it for purely selfless reasons. Because she&#39;s a true philanthropist.<br>I really hope she&#39;s happy and doing well for herself."

Girl literally using the legal logic of a toilet paper ad.
“SHE WAS IN HER THIRTIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEESSS”
If Colleen wasn&#39;t as MASSIVE of a YouTuber would these videos even been made ? It seems to come off as if they weren&#39;t super famous they wouldn&#39;t make the video calling her out for these acts.  <br>Can we please start making videos calling out disgusting weirdos too ? There is actual SICKO&#39;S out doing S3XUAL ACTS ON CHILDREN.<br>It seems like if you can get a crazy amount of views its not getting a video made ....
Lmfao this is funny. And your voice is beautiful
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=806"">13:26</a> She sounds like a cartoon character, I literally love it sm 😂"
I love how she says that her “apology” won’t change anyone’s mind about her but before the video went viral I had no idea what was going on but seeing it made it cement in my mind that she definitely did what she was being accused of…
I’ll admit I said creepy things when I was younger but I was a teen/preteen…. I’m now 21 and realize how creepy it was and throughly regret it. I cannot imagine doing even worse now or being 30 💀💀
"Well, it was kind of a trend to make videos on this apology ukele video thing. Trends to get alot of views, that&#39;s why people do them. So she was right about that. People do make them for money fundamentally. Im sure that there are crazier dramas happening but are less know hence less exposure. So less money"
"gurl, i have no problem with the WOAH! Jeez"
No way<br><br><br>…Read more
Collen paused the comments on the og video💀
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=51"">0:51</a> GAMECUUUUBE!?"
She goes up to an E not an F. I literally checked because I was so impressed by your note recognition lol. Still not too far off!
"Girl, I have just find you and I think &quot;well, that video was good, I don&#39;t think she has anything else for me (as I&#39;m Spanish)&quot; and then I see another &quot;joya&quot; in my feed! I love what you do and how you do it, thank you!"
Damn gabi hit them vocals
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=702"">11:42</a> Spot on! 🎯<br>Yes she is really cringing out on her Ukelele of Shame.<br>She is so condesending and pleased with herself.<br>Hope she has YouTubed for the last time."
She basically parodied herself. And with a Schoolhouse Rock bullshit song.
"Watching this a year after it happened, so thought she must have disappeared off internet. No no she has a new channel that she uplaods to regularly with 3.5 million subscribers."
I loved your musical addition to her singing hahaha made the whole thing.
I DO ALSO SING THIS WHEN I MESS UP IN LIFE
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=810"">13:30</a> I want a full 10-11 minute version of this"
This girls fck up is ultimately what lead me to find this channel and here I am a year and change later still tuning in so I guess rock on Toxic Gossip Train?<br>I wonder what happened she ultimately ended up working at KFC right?
Her calling us a “toxic gossip train” is her way of<br>Apologizing?? Talk about a shitty person
girls suck at apologies and a female youtuber will be worse lol
"I hate that she sings it about the allegations against her because honestly it’s like, not a bad song. Just doesn’t apply to her situation lmao"
"Do Conor McGregor&#39;s &quot;apology&quot;, when he got his second belt."
if it wasnt by her it woulda been a banger
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=33"">0:33</a> when i was younger she always gave me an off feeling and i just couldn&#39;t place it... well now i know why"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=234"">3:54</a> why are her eyes so creepy 😭"
"I just could never wrap my head around pedophiles, like how do you like kids?"
I can’t believe I forgot about this. It’s only been a year
Gabi has such a pretty singing voice like dead a$$ I loved the end where she sang. Also side not I got a GMC add right after miranda said &quot;F*ck me right&quot;💀
"I think her mistake here was not apologizing as a fictional gangster like Kevin Spacey. Actually, fictional gangster ukulele apology video; That&#39;s what we all need for healing."
A year ago?
"&quot;It isn&#39;t true, and I did it in the past so it&#39;s not fair&quot;??????????????"
"Super wierd? Creepy? No it&#39;s criminal. Calling it wierd, creepy, or cringe is shining a light on an action but being wierd, creepy, or cringe is also an excuse that the actions committed don&#39;t warrant full accountability. An adult engaging with minors in a sexual discussion that goes beyond the realm of education or mentorship is criminal. I&#39;m part way through this video of yours and I hope you call the spade a spade."
"Still funny, I haven&#39;t gotten used to it though"
"Hot take everyone will hate: the idea of grooming a straight teenage boy, is absolutely laughable! no teenage boy in the history of ever was harmed by having sex with an older woman. Ever.  Never happened and I defy you to find one REAL example.<br>    Uptight, self-righteous members of society have harmed them.  <br>   I’m sorry, but there are some differences in the sexes that hold through the vast majority of the time.<br>   The only harm that would come to a straight teenage boy, would be how sore his hand would be from getting high-fived so much by his bros.<br>    I like Gabby but she’s totally wrong on this one.<br>   People are just trying to gossip and profit from it.  they didn’t even have sex, it’s freaking underwear. That kid could go to JCPenney and buy some himself. I don’t believe for one second any harm. Came to that kid because some cute older chick sent him some underwear. <br>  I am not a boomer, nor a redneck and I am college educated… this is still ridiculous and I’m not gonna jump on the bandwagon."
Colleen is way too creepy to look at for me to finish this video lol
"Calling it &quot;weird&quot; is wrong. Just imagine it was a guy talking to underage girls. Yeah, you wouldn&#39;t call that &quot;weird&quot;, would you?"
i could never watch her whole song fully through but every few months i watch it and just watch a bit more than last time and get increasingly more shocked about how tf this was real
i could’ve listened to free bird instead of this
genuinely what was her thought process though? was she actually deluded enough to think this would go over well? did she think she wrote such a banger people would fucking stream it and forget about all of the (proven) allegations?? insane behavior
"She wasn&#39;t that creepy, y&#39;all are just being petty and pedantic.<br><br>You think 13 year olds don&#39;t talk about &quot;whether you lost your virginity?&quot; It&#39;s all they talk about<br><br>Fr stop overthinking it - and who cares about sending a bra to someone, they probably found it funny. Just now people are getting hella sensitive about every tiny ass detail.<br><br>Go out for a walk or get a hobby instead of overanalyzing details of someone&#39;s past at a time where people were less woke"
"The thing about children in her audience is because she&#39;s brought up children onto the stage during her live shows and done REALLY inappropriate stuff to them. She&#39;s had a little boy pat her crotch or smth (don&#39;t remember that exactly, and shamed a girl for wearing short shorts (because that&#39;s like one of her common jokes????) and had her spread her legs to the audience."
It feels crazy that this was just a year ago
I&#39;m a millennial and I would like NOT to be put in the same category as this weirdo...
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=54"">0:54</a> except WAAAAAAY less good. Like, 1 billion times less good."
Her saying she’s not manipulating and then proceeding to pretend end the video and fake an on the spot encore is hilarious
The best part of this apology is the guitar hero chart
"You also can&#39;t take accountability lol. You can take responsibility, or you can be accountable."
bot whares the greens??
"You ate that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=412"">6:52</a>"
I watched Colleen’s vid for the first time and said out loud “she was on Broadway?” 😭
"that whole &quot;dramatize, monetize, demise&quot; rhyme scheme was some &quot;lyrical spiritual miracle&quot; type shit"
When you started singing with her I lost it XDDDD
Yeah but it sounded like she was taking acountability and then she called you out on monetising her demise. 😅😅😅😅 sounds to me like your only point is that she is playing a uke . Never heard of this woman and don’t really know you either but ….. 😂😂😂😂
"&quot;I&#39;m not a groomer, I&#39;m just a loser.&quot; Don&#39;t worry you can always be both 😊😊😊😊"
"i feel the need to share that my sister bought a ukulele and learned how to play toxic gossip train. We shared a bedroom.<br>Also, I feel the need to talk about one of my favourite YouTubers, an artimator who yes, is an adult and yes, talks to their fans. But also.. they’re not exactly asking us about our favourite positions.? And they’ve said that if they start being creepy we all have full permission to ruin them, which believe me, I will"
"Shes like &quot;sorry i groomed kids, didnt know everyone else was perfect&quot;"
You’ve got a lovely voice Gabi
Imagine if a man had done this stuff.
Hate to say it and I’m sure it’s auto tuned from hell and back but the vocal quality slaps
I hate Ukeleles so much
"I don&#39;t get it why all the hate for miners, they work so hard in hars conditions in coal mines etc, and for some reasons everyone online are saying basically that none of them should find happiness and love."
Why her hed so big
"The toxic gossip train absolutely exists, it just doesn&#39;t apply to her. The internet has been a cesspool for its entire existence. The barrier of it incentivizes people to release all their nastiness because we think there aren&#39;t going to be consequences."
You had me laughing with the ad libs 😂
YOUR VOICE IS SO BEAUTIFUL OMGGGG
&quot;You&#39;re going to make ad sense. That&#39;s what this is about. . . Not the truth.&quot;<br><br>Those things can both be true. A content creator can want to make money off their content and want the truth.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=537"">8:57</a> I share birthday with this weird, singing thing. Fucking hell."
that foundation really doesn&#39;t match her skin tone. yet another crime
The singing duet got me
"&quot;I was messaging my fans, but not in a creepy way-&quot; dude, messaging minors and trying to be their &quot;buddy&quot; when you&#39;re a grown adult? Yeah, that&#39;s creepy!"
"Okay man, I get Drake&#39;s a bad guy but coming after his race is not the right move."
"&quot;as long as it&#39;s entertainingggggggg&quot; (ah yes! because concern for someone being a pedo, a groomer, INTERESTED IN CHILDREN- as a full, (of knowing age.) adult, is entertaining. I am certainly entertained by the thought of your gross endeavors, thoughts, conversations w fans (minors), and you being a predator, Colleen. I&#39;m just confused to this day, what was that line??? What was every line?????)"

"Colleen does not care, she is going to be canceled so why bother saying sorry"
"Does she... does she actually <i>know</i> what accountability means? This is a genuine question because I don&#39;t think she does. The definition of accountability is to hold yourself responsible for your actions. Someone who is accountable is someone who would realize they did wrong, admit to doing wrong so as to not throw anyone else under the bus, and then do whatever it takes to redeem themselves. This is the definition google gave me: &quot;You don&#39;t blame others or make excuses, and you do what you can to make amends when things go wrong.&quot;<br><br>Let&#39;s recap. She denies that anything happened, starts accusing her audience of spreading lies for fun, accuses them of over exaggerating, claims that she is the victim, and then changes her story to &#39;I did do it, kinda&#39; for no reason than to accuse the audience of ignoring that she &quot;already DID fix things&quot;. That&#39;s a lot of words and none of them are actually something an accountable person would say."
She really used a skin smoothing filter like she wants to look good for her future victims. give us a break
Try to strike a cord and it’s probably a minorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr……
would be even more funny if she used autotune like the tiktokers lmfao

I love it when you sing along with her! 🤭🤭🤣🤣
girl the harmonies im dying 😂
The thing about the last section where she says that it’s just a mistake is the fact that she did that mistake repeatedly for a couple of years so she thought that it was okay to do it back in the day.
YOU WERE IN YOUR THIRTHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
You&#39;re over 30~
"Something I hate tho is that some new friends I don’t even know what she did I said in her and some people that obviously don’t care what she did involved in the past so it doesn’t even matter what she did and which is making me mad because most of those months ago, and the video was that “” she did nothing wrong ““ clearly dont know what she did so they’re not supporting or taking people that have been for a while, taking it serious, which is why new fans really helpful, sexually harassed and mostly minors and they don’t know or don’t care because it was in the past apparently so yeah that’s just weird"
she is a narcissist😂
i have to sit down and watch her apology  im not going to watch her video not going to given her more views
"If I were in charge, her channel would&#39;ve been terminated after this video"
"I genuinely don’t get why you’re calling this an apology, it isn’t, she isn’t sorry"

When Colleen said (sorry SANG)  &quot;well I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not gonna take that route&quot; that was literally the duck song
this fr going to my liked spotify songs
She literally told on herself more than 3 times in this video alone 😂 she knew what she did
We can criticize her all we want but she ate. Lmao.

I knew she was weird when parts of her Miranda Sings act was alluding to incest with her uncle.
im a little late but she looks like momo in that picture HAHAH
it’s SO theater kid coded it’s actually physically uncomfortable
Its WILD because there is actual PROOF of what she&#39;s being accused of and then she sings about taking accountability 😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀
Fun fact: she wrote this song in the key of a minor. I wish I was kidding.

my left ear enjoyed liver king&#39;s apology
But yet people still support Travis Scott to this day
🎶toxic gossip traaaaaiin🎶
Can’t forget the ukelele..
"I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologize. What we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There&#39;s a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn&#39;t. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologize to the internet. I want to apologize to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But most importantly I want to apologize to the victim and his family. For my fans who are defending my actions, please don&#39;t. I don’t deserve to be defended. The goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world I live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don’t expect to be forgiven, I’m just here to apologize. I&#39;m ashamed of myself. I’m disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you."
the dog in team modern&#39;s apology looks like &quot;yeah and why the fuck should i care&quot;
"For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve 1 Corinthians 15:3-5❤❤❤❤😊"
completely forgot about the fine brothers and how they wanted to take ownership for the word “react”
Its funny that now all of these have been eclipsed by Colleen Ballingers.
if someone didnt know any better they would think that sienna&#39;s apology was just another video about inspiration maybe and not in response to a heinous act toxic women like her try and almost always get away with but laura&#39;s apology pissed me the FOOK off for one reason and one reason only...  her fake crying was one thing but I watched the whole thing once and when she spat tryna make it look something real it grossed me out so much to the point where it pisses me off 😭she dribbled and drooled like a crying toddler on camera as if she wasn&#39;t anything other than a 30 some yr old woman if you don&#39;t get yo ahh off the ground 😭😭
I’m Sorry but you forgot P. Diddy and Will Smith and Paula Deen and Michael Richards 😂😂😂
"ukelele should have been the 0th one , but im assuming you didnt include it because it wasn&#39;t much of an apology 💀💀💀"
No uleleke?
Your videos are dope but they end so abruptly it throws me off 😂
Sigma
Make one that has the best YouTube apologies
"Let&#39;s face it, a youtuber could put out the most sincere apology video and the masses still won&#39;t accept it. They&#39;ll gripe that they don&#39;t apologise and they&#39;ll gripe if they do. It&#39;s a lose-lose situation really."
I’m surprised that Colleen vlogs isn’t here😭💀
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=730"">12:10</a> i can&#39;t watch her yapping"
I made apology video because of racism to the gingers in my school.
I keep insisting that Travis Was high on some dope ass shit thats why he looks like he didnt know what happened on the concert
"I don’t understand why that social repose guy needed to apologize? I mean, sure, he needed to apologize to his girlfriend, but why did he need to make a public apology to his fans? He didn’t cheat on his fans."
&quot;Besides it&#39;s almost impossible to have an apology worst...&quot;<br><b>Number 3 on the list</b>
Wow. To think just a few months after this Colleen would blow almost all of these out of the water.
"Anyone starting a YouTube channel, get your apology ready before you start. Always be prepared, don’t wanna land on this list"
Waiting for Mrbeasts apology
Sienna&#39;s was the worst. She did an interpretive dance thinking it makes amends for her raping that dude.
"Why is Laura crying when she’s the one who did it “And this video has been so hard” “It’s almost impossible” “It’s so hard, it’s probably the hardest things I’ve ever done” she did nothing but cry, the most sincere apology I’m really done with her, glad she got canceled on twitter ^^ :]"
"Sienna’s is crazy dude it’s like she made it a documentary and even worse she said the Sam smith song which had the lyrics “I did nothing wrong, I’m young” now wonder it’s the second worst apology video"
The Social Repose Apology Video’s dislike and like ratio is a like a lightsaber💀
The best apology ever was the Manii show&#39;s
How is Logan Paul&#39;s not included?
Most of them sound like they are saying sorry in school after hitting little Timmy on the playground 😭😭😭
"Sunny, I&#39;m a little disappointed.  I&#39;ve made over 16 public apologies here on YouTube -- all of which are terrible, and didn&#39;t even get an honorable mention here? Loce your content, but thie one hurt. Also, I just want to apologize."
Can&#39;t wait for Mr beast to be on part 2

this was made like right before the toxic gossip train hit single came out
I wish it was a top 15.. i miss james charles / jeffree star ect 😂
Damn I was hoping for creepy ukulele song from Colleen
I hate people like this ( people in the video )
I wonder if sunny is going to make a part two if mrbeast makes an apology video
If travis stopped singing do you think they wouldve stopped charging the concert. Because i dont
Did you plan to not have logan paul in there or did you just forget <br><br>&quot;I have made a continuous lapse of my judgement&quot;

Where’s the ukulele girl? Colleen Ballinger?
"I feel very fortunate that I can say: Other than Travis Scott, I&#39;ve not heard of any of these people before. It&#39;s baffling that people would spend their time watching &quot;influencers&quot; like these who talk about things that really don&#39;t matter in life."

"What kind of fucking thought process goes on where cheating on your lover leads to uploading an apology video on Youtube? SORRY FANS, I CHEATED ON MY GIRLFRIEND, I NEED TO APOLOGISE TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE NEGATIVE INVOLVEMENT OTHER THAN JUST BAGGING ME OUT WHEN MY EX GIRLFRIEND MADE A VIDEO ABOUT ME!"
I misread that ”at” as ”ai”
"She just mashed Simply Kenna&#39;s, Team Modern&#39;s, and Shane Dawson&#39;s Re-Apology, Acting like it&#39;s hard, and Saying basic random stuff."
"&quot;BrAgGiNg AbOuT mOnEy.&quot;<br><br>Bro, does just SAYING you&#39;re rich count as bragging? Bragging would be saying something like &quot;I&#39;m richer than you cuz I&#39;m better than you.&quot;"
Think the NoahJ456 video belongs on this list nowadays
Wish this video was made later because NoahJ456 would 10000000000% be on this list lol
He left out the ukulele
Me personally i don&#39;t feel like it was fully travis scott fault people broke in his concert and it was crowded because of those people yes he should have stopped which is no excuses for that but both parties are wrong kinda
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=122"">2:02</a> Why’s Shane Dawson really sound like Mlp fluttershy with an lower voice volume. 😅"
You may need to update this…
kinda surprised logan paul isnt in here
1 thing I will never understand is how people say stuff like &quot; this is one of my hardest videos ever&quot; like what is hard about this just sit in front of the camera and make a sincere apology it is not that difficult
where was the ukelele one?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=381"">6:21</a> ‘I rehearsed this instead of just talking to you guys naturally’ That’s every day for me 😂"
"If the fine bros actually just took down every reaction video, then SSsniperwolf would be a completely different channel."
Logan paul japan forest apology
I love these quaint apologies from the olden days. No ukeleles or anything.
are there any good apology video?
I havent heard of any of these people..
Shane? more like Shame
Then he didn’t come across it by random.
Wow he got kid a killed not cool.
"Uh, IDK if it is for clout but why is Pewdiepie in the description?"
"Binge-Worthy Content, Keep it up Sunny"
You should cover The Manii Show&#39;s apology since it&#39;s like the first YouTube apology that was actually good.
R.I.P to all the people who died in the Travis Scott concert. ❤
"the worst part about travis scott&#39;s mistake and apology: if he just stopped the show like people said, he could&#39;ve avoided all the deaths and injuries he caused"
Sunnyv2: huh what’s that noise?<br><br>* Ukulele starts playing*
Not me waiting for the toxic gossip train
if you have to make an apology video with another one? your done at this point lol😂
I like that everyone’s coming back to this video after Colleen Ballinger’s “apology” video. It’s the toxic gossip trainnnn
I’m so glad I don’t know who any of these people are (except Travis) and never watched their “content”. Shows me I’m on the right path in life.
All aboard!
Nah. Colleen Ballinger has a worse apology than the top 2. She’s recently made another apology for her previous apology
Why are there tears in the thumbnail? Is this click bait??? 🙃

In her eyes she can do no wrong because men tell her how hot she is all day, everyday.<br>So why should she follow the rules of society? She’s young and hot! She’s above the law.<br>She just thinks she’s SO CUTE<br><br><b>not inspired</b>"
"i know this is an old video, but what is up with the way zoomers talk? like the way they move their lips looks so fake and forced. 
<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=128"">2:08</a> it is like instead of just talking naturally she is consciously choosing how to make her lips move, seems so unnatural"
“It’s like a ballet recital” made me laugh 😭😭
"&quot;Kiss a hundred boys and feel like I&#39;m not tied to them.&quot;<br><br>Ummm...... oh, no...."
This thing aged like milk
lmao.... it&#39;s okay because she&#39;s an attractive female. a man would&#39;ve been sentenced to prison
Why is the boy in this situation being believed beyond any doubt??? That video of &quot;proof&quot; was edited and 3 seconds short with no context what so ever...they lived in a house that was filled with kids who would rob a bank for content! This boy was all over her as well...FOR CONTENT. I really hope yall eat your words when true evidence comes out.
"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=140"">2:20</a> I&#39;m pretty sure she was referring to the time in her life and the accusations being the hardest time in her life...not going off social media...that&#39;s common sense."
"Jack wright: i have been sexually assualted<br>Sienna mae: dances to a song with the lyrics &quot;i&#39;ve done nothing wrong, i&#39;m young&quot; and calls it an apology"

"The music in that video is incredibly shitty! She must be a psychopath just for choosing that song. What a nightmare that was having to watch her horrible dancing, it&#39;s so cringe!"
I don&#39;t think Sam Smith would approve of the video if they saw it.
Charlie breakin it down was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen in my life
Ngl Charlie got some better moves than me
This apology just Seems like a big fuck you to the guy she molested
ukulele joke
"if you combine all the brain cells of the people who put this apology together,<br><br>you’d get half a brain cell"
Sienna is a worse dancer than Prince Harry and Yoko Ono! 🤣
here so many years later. &quot;Come add a few inches to your penis&quot; is still the most jarring statement ive heard from a streamer. love it
“I feel proud of the person that I am” JESUS FUCKING YIKES
Shouldn&#39;t even call them apology videos.
🎶🎶🎶I&#39;m sorry I assaulted you🎶🎶🎶- W2S
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I assulted you&quot; - W2S<br><br>😭
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=222"">3:42</a> is my favorite part"
I hope Sam Smith sends her a cease and desist for besmirching his song like that
If Charlie ever makes an Apologie video and dances I will probably be convinced
"Sadly, I could see many public figures doing this sort of non-pology"
She&#39;s disgusting.
Hey Sienna you&#39;ve just been accused of sexual assault and theres video evidence.<br><br>Whats your response? <br>Sienna: 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
Taking advantage of someone while they’re in the most vulnerable state and then addressing your social media status and dancing is such a disgusting move. What an absolute piece of filth
I wonder how the original creators of this song feel that she used their song
This video didn’t age very well <br>Considering the Amanda apology
Scientist really have to look into this bro like how can some people have negative iq that’s ground breaking discovery right there
Sienna Mae dancing ❌<br>Charlie dancing ✔
Sienna Mae probably inspired a plethora of Rapists with this dance her way out of accountability
I love you moist critikal have my babys
"When she pushed herself on him, she could not fathom that at any moment that she was in anyway going to be rejected. I mean, shes so irristable to all right?  She was more than amazed that he wanted nothing of the sort, bottom line."
I love contemporary dance and this woman just ruined it🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
abused by a girl who kissed him. What do you know about abuse
"This is worse than Colleen&#39;s sorry, she made a whole interpretative dance 😂"
her apology video is actually insulting af
"I had to come back to this just to confirm her name, she just popped up on my snap and her name sounded way to familiar"
I guess I&#39;m getting old but this s*** is so  common
That gotta be the worst Apology video of my life
PUT SOME CLOTHES ON LADY
"Hey, why did you hit a 3 year old kid with your car going at 170 miles an hour!!!<br><br>Sienna: IM YOUNG ✨️💅"
Yo colleen balinger just upted the anty. Cringe 💀

"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=32"">0:32</a> no Skyrim npcs are at least coherent"
When I watched the apology video I felt like I was gonna go to Hell for watching it. Plz help I need Logan Paul apology video...
"The fact that the producers were like “Yeah, this is perfect. Everyone will forgive her now!”"
Pewds charlie made her even more famous
"I love her “apology” was basically her saying “I’m young, stop being mean to me for committing one of the worst crimes out there.” 0 clue why she was acting like she did nothing and didn’t commit SA on a guy. Also that’s the stupidest excuse ever, saying “I’m young!” so am I, I’m a teenager, younger than you. But if I committed a crime, just bc I’m a teenager I’m not not responsible."
"ik im like a year late but <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=213"">3:33</a> this is the best apology video out there, it doesnt get better then this"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=365"">6:05</a> little did he know…"
I seriously commend the people watching both this and Colleen&#39;s apologies completely<br>I can&#39;t watch more than 5 seconds of the actual apologies without wanting to vomit my brain and hearts out
"it legit made me choke by laughter, It reminded me Kronk in the Emperor´s new groove movie, when his angel and  devil are arguing and the devil says &quot;reason no. 2, look what I can do &quot; and he just stands in one hand, Kronk is confused asking how is that related to anything and the angel says... no no no, wait, that&#39;s actually not that bad? <br><br>this is like the live action of that scene"
&quot; I&#39;m sorry 🙆‍♀️ I assaulted 💃 you 🕺 &quot;
so that’s why my friend start dancing on me when i die in game. Why can’t I stop laughing watching this shit.
"If malignant narcissism made a video, it would be this."
Why she dancing in her Grammas underwear. She needs to apologize for that to.
&quot;time for jack to let er rip&quot;
"Now she was a man, even her age, could you imagine what would have happened, like she would already be in Alcatraz"
Just wait for Colleen&#39;s apology
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=217"">3:37</a> 😂💀💀💀💀💀💀💀"
Such a woman apology.
This is an order of magnitude delusional than anything I&#39;ve seen before.
"Tbh, with the editing, dance, and script, I thought I was watching an unreleased apology by The Deep."
Sssniperwolf:<br><br>“Allow us to introduce ourselves”
this whole thing feels like springtrap at the end of fnaf vr dancing after taking another victim
Jack : Say sorry your a b!tch <br>Sienna : 🕺🏽
It&#39;s more of a loser kind of way.. so that makes it 100% fine!
Lmfao I was waiting for this one
I commented on her apology and my comment was the only one that didn’t get any likes 💀
She dug her own grave with this one
"I think your the uncle of packgod, your a roaster too, am i wrong?"
"&quot;lets supersize, the Mcdonalds fries&quot; was probably the hardest line anyone has ever heard."
It&#39;s been a year now... Wow
&quot;misinformation&quot;
Ngl Moist is a roast king
You look like a homeless dude.
she did a terrible apology and even worse the lyrics don&#39;t make any sense she made the music industry and humanity mad thats just impressive
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyIKCv4AnB4&amp;t=373"">6:13</a> just a timestamp for my favorite part"

she looks like a walten files character
"Remember back when we saw Logan Paul’s apology and thought, “No one can do worse than this.” 💀"
The best thing we got out of this is a megagonefree cover
this hurted all them victims
"nah i could not watch the video till the end <a href=""UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/LsMfY8P6G-yckNAPjoWA8AI""></a>"
Don’t think this is an apology
The fact that she’s a mom is fucking nuts
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyIKCv4AnB4&amp;t=245"">4:05</a> - Oh, you mean Delunium? It&#39;s an isotope with an atomic weight of &quot;WTF is wrong with you?&quot;"

"hey, its my first time here, but man have you earned my respect"
She’s the female version of EDP445 P Diddy R.Kelly and Dan Snihender she doesn’t want to take accountability for her own actions she’s a PDF
"All I hear is &#39;trauma&#39;, &#39;harm&#39;, &#39;victims&#39; etc.. what horrible thing did she do?"
DEFACATION STATION KILLED ME

"I&#39;ve been following this story since a little while after the allegations came out, but I never saw Charlie&#39;s take on it. I used to be subscribed to her vlog channel and I remember at one point there were videos she uploaded where she couldn&#39;t talk because she had a node on her vocal chords that could have caused her serious vocal damage and would have prevented her from ever singing and performing again. Is it wrong for me to wish that actually happened under the want that this video never happened?"

"My favourite part is when she says “They said I couldn’t say what I wanted to say but never that I couldn’t sing what I want to say” And then goes on to stop singing and talk about her gobeldygook then sings her little chorus then starts talking, Over and over and then my ears are free from torture"
Imagine Siennna Mae dancing while Coleen sings
She should get together with Featureman and fly away off of yt.

It pisses me off that instead of actually taking accountability (not singing about it but not doing it), she&#39;s basically saying she didnt do it when theres proof. But this specific part of the song that i linked just pisses me off the most because now shes basically calling us the bad people and victimizing herself the most. Fuck this"

This wasn&#39;t an apology. This was a murder
"See, this is why Jenna Marbles is a good person. She didn&#39;t downplay any of what happened that led to her apologizing, she didn&#39;t blame anyone, she didn&#39;t defend her actions, she simply and earnestly apologized and sought to validate those who were hurt and better herself. She did the right thing and she didn&#39;t victimize herself or blame anyone. She knew what she did was wrong and wanted to better herself. She also didn&#39;t apologize to gain good faith back, she simply wanted to apologize to those she hurt and validate them. She did it for purely selfless reasons. Because she&#39;s a true philanthropist.<br>I really hope she&#39;s happy and doing well for herself."

There is actual SICKO&#39;S out doing S3XUAL ACTS ON CHILDREN.<br>It seems like if you can get a crazy amount of views its not getting a video made ....
Lmfao this is funny. And your voice is beautiful
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=806"">13:26</a> She sounds like a cartoon character, I literally love it sm 😂"
I love how she says that her “apology” won’t change anyone’s mind about her but before the video went viral I had no idea what was going on but seeing it made it cement in my mind that she definitely did what she was being accused of…
I’ll admit I said creepy things when I was younger but I was a teen/preteen…. I’m now 21 and realize how creepy it was and throughly regret it. I cannot imagine doing even worse now or being 30 💀💀
"Well, it was kind of a trend to make videos on this apology ukele video thing. Trends to get alot of views, that&#39;s why people do them. So she was right about that. People do make them for money fundamentally. Im sure that there are crazier dramas happening but are less know hence less exposure. So less money"
"gurl, i have no problem with the WOAH! Jeez"
No way<br><br><br>…Read more
Collen paused the comments on the og video💀
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=51"">0:51</a> GAMECUUUUBE!?"
She goes up to an E not an F. I literally checked because I was so impressed by your note recognition lol. Still not too far off!
"Girl, I have just find you and I think &quot;well, that video was good, I don&#39;t think she has anything else for me (as I&#39;m Spanish)&quot; and then I see another &quot;joya&quot; in my feed! I love what you do and how you do it, thank you!"
Damn gabi hit them vocals
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=702"">11:42</a> Spot on! 🎯<br>Yes she is really cringing out on her Ukelele of Shame.<br>She is so condesending and pleased with herself.<br>Hope she has YouTubed for the last time."
She basically parodied herself. And with a Schoolhouse Rock bullshit song.
"Watching this a year after it happened, so thought she must have disappeared off internet. No no she has a new channel that she uplaods to regularly with 3.5 million subscribers."
I loved your musical addition to her singing hahaha made the whole thing.
I DO ALSO SING THIS WHEN I MESS UP IN LIFE
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=810"">13:30</a> I want a full 10-11 minute version of this"
This girls fck up is ultimately what lead me to find this channel and here I am a year and change later still tuning in so I guess rock on Toxic Gossip Train?<br>I wonder what happened she ultimately ended up working at KFC right?
Her calling us a “toxic gossip train” is her way of<br>Apologizing?? Talk about a shitty person
girls suck at apologies and a female youtuber will be worse lol
"I hate that she sings it about the allegations against her because honestly it’s like, not a bad song. Just doesn’t apply to her situation lmao"
"Do Conor McGregor&#39;s &quot;apology&quot;, when he got his second belt."
if it wasnt by her it woulda been a banger
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=33"">0:33</a> when i was younger she always gave me an off feeling and i just couldn&#39;t place it... well now i know why"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=234"">3:54</a> why are her eyes so creepy 😭"
"I just could never wrap my head around pedophiles, like how do you like kids?"
I can’t believe I forgot about this. It’s only been a year
Gabi has such a pretty singing voice like dead a$$ I loved the end where she sang. Also side not I got a GMC add right after miranda said &quot;F*ck me right&quot;💀
"I think her mistake here was not apologizing as a fictional gangster like Kevin Spacey. Actually, fictional gangster ukulele apology video; That&#39;s what we all need for healing."
A year ago?
"&quot;It isn&#39;t true, and I did it in the past so it&#39;s not fair&quot;??????????????"
"Super wierd? Creepy? No it&#39;s criminal. Calling it wierd, creepy, or cringe is shining a light on an action but being wierd, creepy, or cringe is also an excuse that the actions committed don&#39;t warrant full accountability. An adult engaging with minors in a sexual discussion that goes beyond the realm of education or mentorship is criminal. I&#39;m part way through this video of yours and I hope you call the spade a spade."
"Still funny, I haven&#39;t gotten used to it though"
"Hot take everyone will hate: the idea of grooming a straight teenage boy, is absolutely laughable! no teenage boy in the history of ever was harmed by having sex with an older woman. Ever.  Never happened and I defy you to find one REAL example.<br>    Uptight, self-righteous members of society have harmed them.  <br>   I’m sorry, but there are some differences in the sexes that hold through the vast majority of the time.<br>   The only harm that would come to a straight teenage boy, would be how sore his hand would be from getting high-fived so much by his bros.<br>    I like Gabby but she’s totally wrong on this one.<br>   People are just trying to gossip and profit from it.  they didn’t even have sex, it’s freaking underwear. That kid could go to JCPenney and buy some himself. I don’t believe for one second any harm. Came to that kid because some cute older chick sent him some underwear. <br>  I am not a boomer, nor a redneck and I am college educated… this is still ridiculous and I’m not gonna jump on the bandwagon."
Colleen is way too creepy to look at for me to finish this video lol
"Calling it &quot;weird&quot; is wrong. Just imagine it was a guy talking to underage girls. Yeah, you wouldn&#39;t call that &quot;weird&quot;, would you?"
i could never watch her whole song fully through but every few months i watch it and just watch a bit more than last time and get increasingly more shocked about how tf this was real
i could’ve listened to free bird instead of this
genuinely what was her thought process though? was she actually deluded enough to think this would go over well? did she think she wrote such a banger people would fucking stream it and forget about all of the (proven) allegations?? insane behavior
"She wasn&#39;t that creepy, y&#39;all are just being petty and pedantic.<br><br>You think 13 year olds don&#39;t talk about &quot;whether you lost your virginity?&quot; It&#39;s all they talk about<br><br>Fr stop overthinking it - and who cares about sending a bra to someone, they probably found it funny. Just now people are getting hella sensitive about every tiny ass detail.<br><br>Go out for a walk or get a hobby instead of overanalyzing details of someone&#39;s past at a time where people were less woke"
"The thing about children in her audience is because she&#39;s brought up children onto the stage during her live shows and done REALLY inappropriate stuff to them. She&#39;s had a little boy pat her crotch or smth (don&#39;t remember that exactly, and shamed a girl for wearing short shorts (because that&#39;s like one of her common jokes????) and had her spread her legs to the audience."
It feels crazy that this was just a year ago
I&#39;m a millennial and I would like NOT to be put in the same category as this weirdo...
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=54"">0:54</a> except WAAAAAAY less good. Like, 1 billion times less good."
Her saying she’s not manipulating and then proceeding to pretend end the video and fake an on the spot encore is hilarious
The best part of this apology is the guitar hero chart
"You also can&#39;t take accountability lol. You can take responsibility, or you can be accountable."
bot whares the greens??
"You ate that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=412"">6:52</a>"
I watched Colleen’s vid for the first time and said out loud “she was on Broadway?” 😭
"that whole &quot;dramatize, monetize, demise&quot; rhyme scheme was some &quot;lyrical spiritual miracle&quot; type shit"
When you started singing with her I lost it XDDDD
Yeah but it sounded like she was taking acountability and then she called you out on monetising her demise. 😅😅😅😅 sounds to me like your only point is that she is playing a uke . Never heard of this woman and don’t really know you either but ….. 😂😂😂😂
"&quot;I&#39;m not a groomer, I&#39;m just a loser.&quot; Don&#39;t worry you can always be both 😊😊😊😊"
"i feel the need to share that my sister bought a ukulele and learned how to play toxic gossip train. We shared a bedroom.<br>Also, I feel the need to talk about one of my favourite YouTubers, an artimator who yes, is an adult and yes, talks to their fans. But also.. they’re not exactly asking us about our favourite positions.? And they’ve said that if they start being creepy we all have full permission to ruin them, which believe me, I will"
"Shes like &quot;sorry i groomed kids, didnt know everyone else was perfect&quot;"
You’ve got a lovely voice Gabi
Imagine if a man had done this stuff.
Hate to say it and I’m sure it’s auto tuned from hell and back but the vocal quality slaps
I hate Ukeleles so much
"I don&#39;t get it why all the hate for miners, they work so hard in hars conditions in coal mines etc, and for some reasons everyone online are saying basically that none of them should find happiness and love."
Why her hed so big
"The toxic gossip train absolutely exists, it just doesn&#39;t apply to her. The internet has been a cesspool for its entire existence. The barrier of it incentivizes people to release all their nastiness because we think there aren&#39;t going to be consequences."
You had me laughing with the ad libs 😂
YOUR VOICE IS SO BEAUTIFUL OMGGGG
&quot;You&#39;re going to make ad sense. That&#39;s what this is about. . . Not the truth.&quot;<br><br>Those things can both be true. A content creator can want to make money off their content and want the truth.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=537"">8:57</a> I share birthday with this weird, singing thing. Fucking hell."
that foundation really doesn&#39;t match her skin tone. yet another crime
The singing duet got me
"&quot;I was messaging my fans, but not in a creepy way-&quot; dude, messaging minors and trying to be their &quot;buddy&quot; when you&#39;re a grown adult? Yeah, that&#39;s creepy!"
"Okay man, I get Drake&#39;s a bad guy but coming after his race is not the right move."
"&quot;as long as it&#39;s entertainingggggggg&quot; (ah yes! because concern for someone being a pedo, a groomer, INTERESTED IN CHILDREN- as a full, (of knowing age.) adult, is entertaining. I am certainly entertained by the thought of your gross endeavors, thoughts, conversations w fans (minors), and you being a predator, Colleen. I&#39;m just confused to this day, what was that line??? What was every line?????)"
"*indubitably <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=104"">1:44</a>"
Time to update the title. Cody Ko DJing Sorry by Justin Bieber is the worst ever now.

"Oh man, that&#39;s &quot;undert(r)aining&quot;... ^^"
"Colleen does not care, she is going to be canceled so why bother saying sorry"
"Does she... does she actually <i>know</i> what accountability means? This is a genuine question because I don&#39;t think she does. The definition of accountability is to hold yourself responsible for your actions. Someone who is accountable is someone who would realize they did wrong, admit to doing wrong so as to not throw anyone else under the bus, and then do whatever it takes to redeem themselves. This is the definition google gave me: &quot;You don&#39;t blame others or make excuses, and you do what you can to make amends when things go wrong.&quot;<br><br>Let&#39;s recap. She denies that anything happened, starts accusing her audience of spreading lies for fun, accuses them of over exaggerating, claims that she is the victim, and then changes her story to &#39;I did do it, kinda&#39; for no reason than to accuse the audience of ignoring that she &quot;already DID fix things&quot;. That&#39;s a lot of words and none of them are actually something an accountable person would say."
She really used a skin smoothing filter like she wants to look good for her future victims. give us a break
Try to strike a cord and it’s probably a minorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr……
would be even more funny if she used autotune like the tiktokers lmfao

"This is my first time even listening to this person&#39;s music or voice or whatever, she got a good good voice... For it to be wasted like this makes me wanna cry"
I love it when you sing along with her! 🤭🤭🤣🤣
girl the harmonies im dying 😂
The thing about the last section where she says that it’s just a mistake is the fact that she did that mistake repeatedly for a couple of years so she thought that it was okay to do it back in the day.
YOU WERE IN YOUR THIRTHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
You&#39;re over 30~
"Something I hate tho is that some new friends I don’t even know what she did I said in her and some people that obviously don’t care what she did involved in the past so it doesn’t even matter what she did and which is making me mad because most of those months ago, and the video was that “” she did nothing wrong ““ clearly dont know what she did so they’re not supporting or taking people that have been for a while, taking it serious, which is why new fans really helpful, sexually harassed and mostly minors and they don’t know or don’t care because it was in the past apparently so yeah that’s just weird"
she is a narcissist😂
i have to sit down and watch her apology  im not going to watch her video not going to given her more views
"If I were in charge, her channel would&#39;ve been terminated after this video"
"I genuinely don’t get why you’re calling this an apology, it isn’t, she isn’t sorry"
"As a millennial musician, im offended. @<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8d2PntfD6g&amp;t=335"">5:35</a> She is just odd, herself. Lol"
She kinda ate downnnn on the vocals and writing I’m SAURYYY

it’s SO theater kid coded it’s actually physically uncomfortable
Its WILD because there is actual PROOF of what she&#39;s being accused of and then she sings about taking accountability 😂😂😂💀💀💀💀💀
Fun fact: she wrote this song in the key of a minor. I wish I was kidding.

"As an (actual) dancer, your eyes don&#39;t deceive you. This isn&#39;t some &quot;Y&#39;all aren&#39;t cultured enough to understand her dance&quot; thing. She&#39;s just not good at dancing. It doesn&#39;t even go with the music lmao"

Inspire. LMAO. She thinks she’s inspiring.
"She’s used to men falling at her feet and giving her millions of compliments. In her eyes she can do no wrong because men tell her how hot she is all day, everyday.<br>So why should she follow the rules of society? She’s young and hot!

"At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=140"">2:20</a> I&#39;m pretty sure she was referring to the time in her life and the accusations being the hardest time in her life...not going off social media...that&#39;s common sense."
"Jack wright: i have been sexually assualted<br>Sienna mae: dances to a song with the lyrics &quot;i&#39;ve done nothing wrong, i&#39;m young&quot; and calls it an apology"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=212"">3:32</a> Dude I was wheezing at this for like 15 minutes straight. Real tears were flowing.<br><br>“Hit em with the Mickey Mouse clubhouse dance” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=173"">2:53</a> LMFAOO the fact that she clarified “unedited” photos is fucking hilarious. Probably got called out for photoshopping shit and got angry about it LOL<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=220"">3:40</a> EXACTLY LIKE WHY DID SHE CLARIFY THE UNEDITED PART BWAHAHA"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=89"">1:29</a> &quot;Well, that one didn&#39;t age quite so well!&quot;"
"The music in that video is incredibly shitty! She must be a psychopath just for choosing that song. What a nightmare that was having to watch her horrible dancing, it&#39;s so cringe!"
I don&#39;t think Sam Smith would approve of the video if they saw it.
Charlie breakin it down was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen in my life
Ngl Charlie got some better moves than me
This apology just Seems like a big fuck you to the guy she molested
ukulele joke
"if you combine all the brain cells of the people who put this apology together,<br><br>you’d get half a brain cell"
Sienna is a worse dancer than Prince Harry and Yoko Ono! 🤣
here so many years later. &quot;Come add a few inches to your penis&quot; is still the most jarring statement ive heard from a streamer. love it
“I feel proud of the person that I am” JESUS FUCKING YIKES
Shouldn&#39;t even call them apology videos.
🎶🎶🎶I&#39;m sorry I assaulted you🎶🎶🎶- W2S
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I assulted you&quot; - W2S<br><br>😭
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=222"">3:42</a> is my favorite part"
I hope Sam Smith sends her a cease and desist for besmirching his song like that
If Charlie ever makes an Apologie video and dances I will probably be convinced
"Sadly, I could see many public figures doing this sort of non-pology"
She&#39;s disgusting.
Hey Sienna you&#39;ve just been accused of sexual assault and theres video evidence.<br><br>Whats your response? <br>Sienna: 💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾💃🏾
Taking advantage of someone while they’re in the most vulnerable state and then addressing your social media status and dancing is such a disgusting move. What an absolute piece of filth
I wonder how the original creators of this song feel that she used their song
This video didn’t age very well <br>Considering the Amanda apology
Scientist really have to look into this bro like how can some people have negative iq that’s ground breaking discovery right there
Sienna Mae dancing ❌<br>Charlie dancing ✔
Sienna Mae probably inspired a plethora of Rapists with this dance her way out of accountability
I love you moist critikal have my babys
"When she pushed herself on him, she could not fathom that at any moment that she was in anyway going to be rejected. I mean, shes so irristable to all right?  She was more than amazed that he wanted nothing of the sort, bottom line."
I love contemporary dance and this woman just ruined it🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
abused by a girl who kissed him. What do you know about abuse
"This is worse than Colleen&#39;s sorry, she made a whole interpretative dance 😂"
her apology video is actually insulting af
"I had to come back to this just to confirm her name, she just popped up on my snap and her name sounded way to familiar"
I guess I&#39;m getting old but this s*** is so  common
That gotta be the worst Apology video of my life
PUT SOME CLOTHES ON LADY
"Hey, why did you hit a 3 year old kid with your car going at 170 miles an hour!!!<br><br>Sienna: IM YOUNG ✨️💅"
Yo colleen balinger just upted the anty. Cringe 💀
Man the toxic gossip train really be chugging down the tracks of misinformation
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=32"">0:32</a> no Skyrim npcs are at least coherent"
When I watched the apology video I felt like I was gonna go to Hell for watching it. Plz help I need Logan Paul apology video...
"The fact that the producers were like “Yeah, this is perfect. Everyone will forgive her now!”"
Pewds charlie made her even more famous
"I love her “apology” was basically her saying “I’m young, stop being mean to me for committing one of the worst crimes out there.” 0 clue why she was acting like she did nothing and didn’t commit SA on a guy. Also that’s the stupidest excuse ever, saying “I’m young!” so am I, I’m a teenager, younger than you. But if I committed a crime, just bc I’m a teenager I’m not not responsible."
"ik im like a year late but <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=213"">3:33</a> this is the best apology video out there, it doesnt get better then this"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=365"">6:05</a> little did he know…"
I seriously commend the people watching both this and Colleen&#39;s apologies completely<br>I can&#39;t watch more than 5 seconds of the actual apologies without wanting to vomit my brain and hearts out
"it legit made me choke by laughter, It reminded me Kronk in the Emperor´s new groove movie, when his angel and  devil are arguing and the devil says &quot;reason no. 2, look what I can do &quot; and he just stands in one hand, Kronk is confused asking how is that related to anything and the angel says... no no no, wait, that&#39;s actually not that bad? <br><br>this is like the live action of that scene"
&quot; I&#39;m sorry 🙆‍♀️ I assaulted 💃 you 🕺 &quot;
so that’s why my friend start dancing on me when i die in game. Why can’t I stop laughing watching this shit.
"If malignant narcissism made a video, it would be this."
Why she dancing in her Grammas underwear. She needs to apologize for that to.
&quot;time for jack to let er rip&quot;
"Now she was a man, even her age, could you imagine what would have happened, like she would already be in Alcatraz"
Just wait for Colleen&#39;s apology
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RH8H4Z07FIo&amp;t=217"">3:37</a> 😂💀💀💀💀💀💀💀"
Such a woman apology.
This is an order of magnitude delusional than anything I&#39;ve seen before.
"Tbh, with the editing, dance, and script, I thought I was watching an unreleased apology by The Deep."
Sssniperwolf:<br><br>“Allow us to introduce ourselves”
this whole thing feels like springtrap at the end of fnaf vr dancing after taking another victim
Jack : Say sorry your a b!tch <br>Sienna : 🕺🏽
Oh I remember this guy from a video called Be amazed

whole idea of demanding from someone to make apology video is snowflake crying.
i mean laura stands for..L aura sooo...she matches her name lol
What about logan paul?
"No matter what people say or do in an “apology video”, people will complain.  Not sincere, too sincere, too happy, not sad enough, too soon, too late, too brief, too long, why the makeup?  Why no makeup?  It’s bananas.. lol."

But yet people still support Travis Scott to this day
🎶toxic gossip traaaaaiin🎶
Can’t forget the ukelele..
"I made a severe and continuous lapse in my judgement, and I don’t expect to be forgiven. I’m simply here to apologize. What we came across that day in the woods was obviously unplanned. The reactions you saw on tape were raw; they were unfiltered. None of us knew how to react or how to feel. I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down and stopped recording what we were going through. There&#39;s a lot of things I should have done differently but I didn&#39;t. And for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry. I want to apologize to the internet. I want to apologize to anyone who has seen the video. I want to apologize to anyone who has been affected or touched by mental illness, or depression, or suicide. But most importantly I want to apologize to the victim and his family. For my fans who are defending my actions, please don&#39;t. I don’t deserve to be defended. The goal with my content is always to entertain; to push the boundaries, to be all-inclusive. In the world I live in, I share almost everything I do. The intent is never to be heartless, cruel, or malicious. Like I said I made a huge mistake. I don’t expect to be forgiven, I’m just here to apologize. I&#39;m ashamed of myself. I’m disappointed in myself. And I promise to be better. I will be better. Thank you."
the dog in team modern&#39;s apology looks like &quot;yeah and why the fuck should i care&quot;
"For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve 1 Corinthians 15:3-5❤❤❤❤😊"
completely forgot about the fine brothers and how they wanted to take ownership for the word “react”
Its funny that now all of these have been eclipsed by Colleen Ballingers.
if someone didnt know any better they would think that sienna&#39;s apology was just another video about inspiration maybe and not in response to a heinous act toxic women like her try and almost always get away with but laura&#39;s apology pissed me the FOOK off for one reason and one reason only...  her fake crying was one thing but I watched the whole thing once and when she spat tryna make it look something real it grossed me out so much to the point where it pisses me off 😭she dribbled and drooled like a crying toddler on camera as if she wasn&#39;t anything other than a 30 some yr old woman if you don&#39;t get yo ahh off the ground 😭😭
I’m Sorry but you forgot P. Diddy and Will Smith and Paula Deen and Michael Richards 😂😂😂
"ukelele should have been the 0th one , but im assuming you didnt include it because it wasn&#39;t much of an apology 💀💀💀"
No uleleke?
Your videos are dope but they end so abruptly it throws me off 😂
Sigma
Make one that has the best YouTube apologies
"Let&#39;s face it, a youtuber could put out the most sincere apology video and the masses still won&#39;t accept it. They&#39;ll gripe that they don&#39;t apologise and they&#39;ll gripe if they do. It&#39;s a lose-lose situation really."
I’m surprised that Colleen vlogs isn’t here😭💀
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=730"">12:10</a> i can&#39;t watch her yapping"
I made apology video because of racism to the gingers in my school.
I keep insisting that Travis Was high on some dope ass shit thats why he looks like he didnt know what happened on the concert
"I don’t understand why that social repose guy needed to apologize? I mean, sure, he needed to apologize to his girlfriend, but why did he need to make a public apology to his fans? He didn’t cheat on his fans."
&quot;Besides it&#39;s almost impossible to have an apology worst...&quot;<br><b>Number 3 on the list</b>
Wow. To think just a few months after this Colleen would blow almost all of these out of the water.
"Anyone starting a YouTube channel, get your apology ready before you start. Always be prepared, don’t wanna land on this list"
Waiting for Mrbeasts apology
Sienna&#39;s was the worst. She did an interpretive dance thinking it makes amends for her raping that dude.
"Why is Laura crying when she’s the one who did it “And this video has been so hard” “It’s almost impossible” “It’s so hard, it’s probably the hardest things I’ve ever done” she did nothing but cry, the most sincere apology I’m really done with her, glad she got canceled on twitter ^^ :]"
"Sienna’s is crazy dude it’s like she made it a documentary and even worse she said the Sam smith song which had the lyrics “I did nothing wrong, I’m young” now wonder it’s the second worst apology video"
The Social Repose Apology Video’s dislike and like ratio is a like a lightsaber💀
The best apology ever was the Manii show&#39;s
How is Logan Paul&#39;s not included?
Most of them sound like they are saying sorry in school after hitting little Timmy on the playground 😭😭😭
"Sunny, I&#39;m a little disappointed.  I&#39;ve made over 16 public apologies here on YouTube -- all of which are terrible, and didn&#39;t even get an honorable mention here? Loce your content, but thie one hurt. Also, I just want to apologize."
Can&#39;t wait for Mr beast to be on part 2
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=410"">6:50</a> NO NOT TMARTN HE GOATED"
this was made like right before the toxic gossip train hit single came out
I wish it was a top 15.. i miss james charles / jeffree star ect 😂
Damn I was hoping for creepy ukulele song from Colleen
I hate people like this ( people in the video )
I wonder if sunny is going to make a part two if mrbeast makes an apology video
If travis stopped singing do you think they wouldve stopped charging the concert. Because i dont
Did you plan to not have logan paul in there or did you just forget <br><br>&quot;I have made a continuous lapse of my judgement&quot;
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=1"">0:01</a>"
Where’s the ukulele girl? Colleen Ballinger?
"I feel very fortunate that I can say: Other than Travis Scott, I&#39;ve not heard of any of these people before. It&#39;s baffling that people would spend their time watching &quot;influencers&quot; like these who talk about things that really don&#39;t matter in life."
Where the hell is liver kings nips

I wish you put kudas from creature hub on here he had sex with co workers and so many weird things that led up to their failure please cover creature hub

"What kind of fucking thought process goes on where cheating on your lover leads to uploading an apology video on Youtube? SORRY FANS, I CHEATED ON MY GIRLFRIEND, I NEED TO APOLOGISE TO PEOPLE THAT HAVE NEGATIVE INVOLVEMENT OTHER THAN JUST BAGGING ME OUT WHEN MY EX GIRLFRIEND MADE A VIDEO ABOUT ME!"
I misread that ”at” as ”ai”
"She just mashed Simply Kenna&#39;s, Team Modern&#39;s, and Shane Dawson&#39;s Re-Apology, Acting like it&#39;s hard, and Saying basic random stuff."
"&quot;BrAgGiNg AbOuT mOnEy.&quot;<br><br>Bro, does just SAYING you&#39;re rich count as bragging? Bragging would be saying something like &quot;I&#39;m richer than you cuz I&#39;m better than you.&quot;"
Think the NoahJ456 video belongs on this list nowadays
Wish this video was made later because NoahJ456 would 10000000000% be on this list lol
He left out the ukulele
Me personally i don&#39;t feel like it was fully travis scott fault people broke in his concert and it was crowded because of those people yes he should have stopped which is no excuses for that but both parties are wrong kinda
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=122"">2:02</a> Why’s Shane Dawson really sound like Mlp fluttershy with an lower voice volume. 😅"
You may need to update this…
kinda surprised logan paul isnt in here
1 thing I will never understand is how people say stuff like &quot; this is one of my hardest videos ever&quot; like what is hard about this just sit in front of the camera and make a sincere apology it is not that difficult
where was the ukelele one?
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6As4Z6tS8i0&amp;t=381"">6:21</a> ‘I rehearsed this instead of just talking to you guys naturally’ That’s every day for me 😂"
"If the fine bros actually just took down every reaction video, then SSsniperwolf would be a completely different channel."
Logan paul japan forest apology
I love these quaint apologies from the olden days. No ukeleles or anything.
are there any good apology video?
I havent heard of any of these people..
Shane? more like Shame
Then he didn’t come across it by random.
Wow he got kid a killed not cool.
"Uh, IDK if it is for clout but why is Pewdiepie in the description?"
"Binge-Worthy Content, Keep it up Sunny"
You should cover The Manii Show&#39;s apology since it&#39;s like the first YouTube apology that was actually good.
R.I.P to all the people who died in the Travis Scott concert. ❤
"the worst part about travis scott&#39;s mistake and apology: if he just stopped the show like people said, he could&#39;ve avoided all the deaths and injuries he caused"
Sunnyv2: huh what’s that noise?<br><br>* Ukulele starts playing*
Not me waiting for the toxic gossip train
if you have to make an apology video with another one? your done at this point lol😂
I like that everyone’s coming back to this video after Colleen Ballinger’s “apology” video. It’s the toxic gossip trainnnn
I’m so glad I don’t know who any of these people are (except Travis) and never watched their “content”. Shows me I’m on the right path in life.
All aboard!
Nah. Colleen Ballinger has a worse apology than the top 2. She’s recently made another apology for her previous apology
Why are there tears in the thumbnail? Is this click bait??? 🙃
"It&#39;s about the pursuit of truth and integrity, not the race for speed and spectacle. In our rush to be first at everything, we&#39;ve neglected the importance of truth and are inadvertently fostering a victim mentality in young people.

Great presentation.
"Every time you hear the word &#39;woke&#39;, replace it with the word &#39;representation&#39;. That, in essence, is the message.<br><br>Representation inconveniences those with authority and power and the advantageous position many find themselves in. Which is why conservatism is challenged by it (because conservatism is about protecting &#39;the way things are&#39; to those who it suits).<br><br>Dont be considerate; it will worsen your situation. Its a fine argument, but a thoroughly obviously selfish one."
Which British values? Poor people don&#39;t care? We looked at scan photos of wife&#39;s fetus (because he is old shool) and wondered what it would look like at 20months?<br>.

"Yeah, I disagree hard with that speech. &quot;Wokism&quot; isn&#39;t  plain stupidity, just as &quot;Western civilization&quot; isn&quot;t  common sense. Try to dwell in any of both these items and you just find yourself blinded by your own light. Try to take a step further outside of the common box the next time around."
LOL! I loved these burns. This was such a fucking amazing speech
"something about him saying &#39;we would all send plumes of co2 into the atmosphere for the sake of our own children&#39;, watching everyone clap, and realising that statement roughly translates to &#39;humans care more about themselves than the planet to that extreme AND will clap for it&#39;...<br>...sort of sounds like the climate change problem in a nutshell."
"His argument is so fundamentally flawed amd juvenile. It isn&#39;t &quot;poor people&quot; that are profiting from fossil fuel extraction but the fossil fuel companies that have know about climate change since the 1970s, covered up their findings and bribed politicians to continue with the status quo. Fine if you dont care or want to believe in climate change but millions die and suffer from diseases related to the air and water pollution from fossil fuel extraction and processing but I guess that doesn&#39;t matter because it isn&#39;t sudden and in your face to see everyday. China cares about climate change as it now the market leader in solar panels, EV and other green technologies and installing more green energy capacity than any other country, but facts don&#39;t line up with the beliefs you want to hold."

"I was really beginning to enjoy Konstantin&#39;s speech until he got to the point where he accused the poor who, in his own words, &quot;couldn&#39;t give a shit about serving the planet.&quot; Somehow, you&#39;re right that only 2 percent is yours in UK, but we all live in one world. I wasn&#39;t born yesterday to not notice how the rich countries work. Of course, your backyard&#39;s clean because you&#39;re rich, but where did you throw your trash?<br><br>Where do you think the dirty coal that India still uses came from? Who owns those tons of crates of garbage that was thrown in Philippines? Which country&#39;s depleting Myanmar&#39;s resources and the natives are losing their land and forest right now?

there is no woke culture no one would call the worst of an idea a culture it&#39;s just the stupid misunderstanding what the idea was the another stupid group misunderstanding everything as they usually does!

"thats the problem here! hes completely right... yet he is just talking?! since when did talking solve any problems on this planet? never!<br>actions weight more than words and what actions have been taken? ofc shouting loudly on a street is not an action.... its the same as writing this comment here!<br>you guys voted... you guys voted for the people, who have produced this outcome and now you have to carry the consequences... <br><br>but hey, somewhere in some room, some dude, speaks to other people who already know what he says! looks like for the mayority this was and still is enough!<br><br>not convinced? look at the UK these days :) also this video here has led to the current situation, since it calms people down, hearing what they think and since its 2024 and imagining things is enough and higher priority than reality, you have the UK right now as it is as the consequence... who could have thought, right? XD"
"The UK outsources most of their production, just like most 1st world countries. I assure you that the UK is responsible for more than 2% of carbon emissions. They&#39;re just funding it on different soil. So yes, there is more that could be done. But they won&#39;t because it&#39;s outsourced for the same reason the rich are not going to foot the bill for people working and creating to create CHEAP renewable energy; money. Cost and profit margins are the deciding factor. That&#39;s why we complain, because those of us working and creating will have the ideas, but most of us will never have the money to actually fund these endeavors. The people who do and who will, will do it for profit. And unless many companies with the funds globally come together and decide they&#39;re going to end world hunger, provide clean water, and provide renewable energy, that&#39;s not going to change."

Magnificent material for my debate class 🙏
"The Origins of “Woke”
<br>The term “woke” originated in African American communities in the United States, particularly within AAVE. It was initially used to describe someone who was aware of and knowledgeable about the systemic injustices faced by marginalized communities, especially people of color. Derived from African American Vernacular English, it emerged as a form of resistance against oppression and inequality.? <br>Disgruntled White Conservative Influences has refined WOKE into a white man&#39;s word, They could not find another word for themselves the dumb asses hahaha"
"With all due respect, this idea of &quot;we&#39;re only responsible for x% of climate change&quot; is a disingenuous practice that speaks of laziness rather than logic."
BS. Total trash definition of woke. He thinks Trump would make better leader of free world! No thank you!
"Excellent, sobering speech. <br><br>Too bad that, as Konstantin said in the very introduction, to WOKE degenerates, feelings are more important than facts, than truth."

"The pole of English politics is also greasy and bloody. Over 200 million humans died of English imperialistic colonialism&#39;s terroristic invasions and subjugations of smaller countries, just for the sake of English empire&#39;s global economic status as #1 in rank."
"It&#39;s funny that this guy is worried about Vladimir Putin as an enemy going to capitalize western cultural values. while completely forgetting that Putin is a westerner who&#39;s already using western system. <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJdqJu-6ZPo&amp;t=468"">7:48</a> He is right! You&#39;re not going to get those people to stay poor because some of those people prefer to live with simple life rather than extravagant. Otherwise, he&#39;s just projecting his own personal ideal life, which is being financially rich. But that would consequently make him wrong because he&#39;s completely disregarding those people&#39;s preference for way of living. He&#39;s the one who keeps believing that he has no agency by relying on poor people and communist government in formulating his stance on what to do with climate change because he couldn&#39;t even formulate his own individual perspective. (so much for freedom and liberty of thinking) and complaining about woke people by acting like a victim by blaming the current communist China&#39;s government while completely forgetting the fact that communism, which is Karl Marx&#39; ideology that&#39;s western ideology was adapted by China in order to not look like an enemy that would get attacked by Soviet army and simultaneously against the terroristic English imperialists&#39; threats such as the opium war that was perpetrated by barbaric British traders. The fact that this guy is relying on poor people and communist government in terms of forming his stance and using whataboutism in what to do about the climate change... is basically reveals that he couldn&#39;t even formulate his own individual perspective. So much for freedom and liberty of thinking. He also didn&#39;t really argued against the woke people&#39;s notions therefore, he failed. He tried to give the clean energ and cheap argument but completely forgot to mention that the energy is not solely the thing problem but also material garbage pollution that the western countries dominate in global contribution due to the consequent act of non-western government&#39;s defensive precaution against western terroristic imperialists&#39; threats toward those non-western countries and the transnational western trading factories in those countries for the sake of the maintenance of the supply of valuable resources necessary for the survival of English empire&#39;s global economic status as the #1 in rank."
That man is absolutely right. Have any of these WOKE protesters ever developed or invented anything to save or support the environment. Talking is the easy way and doing is the hard way.
"I used to vote liberal but they&#39;ve been taken over by the radical woke ideology, which is just another form of racism and intolerance disguised as some kind of &quot;social justice.&quot; Thank goodness we have these guys exposing them!"
Kennedy 2024!!!
"Climate change is the number one existential issue of our time. For those among us who feel the need to line their pockets or feed their egos off denying this fact, grow a brain cell. &quot;Clever&quot; fools who find humor in making light of this issue should look at the latest WEF appraisal as to the level of threat, which finally acknowledges what the scientists (even in the oil industry) have been saying for decades..."
I have watched this at least a dozen times over the past year. It gives me hope that we still have a voice in the madness
Canada is woke perfected textbook example. Sheep cowards do not fight back.
Brilliant!!!
"Oh man. - Imagine the woke agenda having to deal with Starmer&#39;s;&#39; Pro Sharia law &#39; mates,  Oh, you guys are sooo screwed."
"Oh no, he told them to work for what they wanted! They don&#39;t like that"
&quot;You&#39;re not going to get these people to stay poor.&quot;<br><br>Come to the US. It seems that people here have degrees in mooching off the welfare system. 😂
"At some point in time in our past, woke people would fill mental institutions. How did this happen?"
"The reason why a lot of poor countries have high amounts carbon emission is beacuse of their population .<br>Countries like India and China habe over a billion people while the UK just has 65 million. <br>The real difference comes in per capita emessions wealther countries and wealthier people do have  higher per capita emissions, not poor people ."
This is like that 13 year old &quot;never talk to the police&quot; video. I like to watch it a few times a year just for fun.
"All woke and dei people can freely go and live in Africa, there they will be able to pay off their “debt”, since they suffer so much from it."
"Por fin un hombre joven con sentido común, y la inteligente para expresar mis ideas. La agenda o ideología WOKE es basura para la vida en este planeta."
&quot;It will be decided by poor people who DO NOT CARE about saving the planet&quot;<br>&quot;question&quot;<br>&quot;No thank you.&quot;<br>Epic. Don&#39;t take stupid questions when you have a point to make still.
Brilliant 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
"Thank you Mr. Kisin. Well said, Sir ! Not just Putin but WEF, The CCP.  and globalists."
Absolutely spot on!
"It is not a question of being poor, the issue is people who need money to reside paying rent. The system has reverted to possible earnings being standardized to not being enough. Then, you need to ask about China, why they are all so sane, smart, economically fine, not homeless, have culture, pay 2 dollars for clothing, and 10 dollars for phones, 40 dollars for computers, and 1000 dollars for a car."
"woke has become objective reality and now means that you buy the cheapest option versus the brand name, because technology (and AI) has facilitated the quality gap to be bridged. For example lab diamond versus real diamonds, stamped clothing versus the &quot;official&quot; clothing, rebadging items, sticker says Apple 9.0, but is a smart underneath, fly econo versus first class, take a ride-share versus buy a car, etc. on the logic that you are dumb and NOT smart if you pay 20X the price for anything that is a good enough representation of the same product because from the &quot;factory&quot; it cost 4 usd to make regardless of the brand.
<br>Woke is accelerated by technology doing increasing workloads of human jobs, this means no monthly salaries anymore, but freelance fee paid to you for the job, which AI did 80% of anyway, so 5 usd per hour is generous.
<br>Further this affects relationships among humans, where marriage was until death, increasingly it is about the 1 night stand relationship, then move on to the next, and pets (dogs and cats) have gained marriage status, being valued equal to or greater than humans to live under the same roof with.
<br>Social impact is seen, where the male is still expected to earn and pay bills, despite the same being excluded from the corporate hiring practices, relegating a man to hard labor jobs only, and a &quot;threat&quot; in the &quot;office&quot;."
Psychologue et psychiatre sont l&#39;avenir 😂😂😂😂😂 et bon courage aux jeunes qui ne paieront pas les retraites de leurs parents. Et oui et vos parents vous ont portes😅😅. Affaires de votre famille
Woke voices??? 😂😂😂😂😂😂  sleeping noise that repesent a minority.... because they are so sound ASLEEP🤯🤯🤯
"Im really appreciate the rational speaking of Konstantin, but the point is to give as much more rational  thinking,  BECAUSE  we as people need something consistent. I&#39;m coming from Earth, and believe me, it tried to kill us 100x1000 times, and you are still here is safe if you find some control. Ask some astrophysics how much impact will have some Supernova blows would like millions of years ago if we in the way. We live on this planet by coincidence and luck and you should appreciate every second we are here."
I always come back to this just to show people how woke culture really has devolved hard.
💯
A brilliant speech with a lot of good Humor 👍
Wow that man is quite a grifter 😅. Im surprised he didnt svck himself off right then and there.
"A filthy traitor is spewing lies about the country his parents were also proud to betray. But hey, when you allow traitors into your so-called establishment it tells everything about you to anyone who wants to know the truth about British."
"One point, I&#39;d argue that Climate Change would be fairly high on XJP priority list. China is a 4000 year old civilization, and XJP doesn&#39;t have to worry about ruling terms and reelection, it&#39;s stewardship of an established civilization, not the building of a new one. There is a fundamental difference in mentality there, which is important to highlight as the speaker illustrates a relatable scenario, using relatable imagery for XJP&#39;s life. <br><br>Sustainability in that context would be an underlying principle, and if one takes a look at China&#39;s adoption of sustainable measures, the reality reinforces this statement."
Like it!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJdqJu-6ZPo&amp;t=454"">7:34</a> precisely my stance on caring for the environment. People come first. Life first. Figure out climate issues in the context living an actual life that doesn&#39;t involve iron age regression"
"Woke culture should not be called like that, It gives false meaning to a term awaken. Same as homophobia, no one is affraid of gays, people mostly hate them, but they don&#39;t fear them. So basically everything about &quot;woke&quot; culture is false starting from the terminology to ithe deology. Should be called &quot;misguided&quot; culture, and  the root to this problem is deep mistrust towards autority. And this distrust snd its roots are s theme  for itself."
"Sir, please help us in America! We are unbelievably tolerant with this madness. Help!! TRUMP 🇺🇸🇺🇸💪🇺🇸🏴‍☠️"
wild west needs you to be the governor
"Not all people from other racial-grouos/cultures are interested in this stupid, nihilistic woke-garbage.<br>Russia, China, South African Nations, South American nations and others, are pushing agaist Western-liberalism.<br><br>Seriously, white-liberals think they know better than everyone else. They are completely delusional and self-righteous.🌏🤡"
Great speech.
"Very good but, he believes climate change is real?!"
"Britain, Australia, Canada, the United States have a duty to retain their identities. And the current demand that they must change, is an extension of the new demand, mandate of compliance, acquiescence, obedience, and submission placed upon us. While recognising and respecting other cultures is important, it is no more critical, and vital than our collective respect, regard, and appreciation of our own identities, our own institutional pillars, and institutions, the values and traditions that have long defined our countries, and societies, and not allow them to be deconstructed, broken down, and dismantled.
<br>
<br>It is not about intolerance, and inequality (favouritism) it is about ensuring our core values remain strong, durable and influential. By doing so we can maintain the integrity of our institutions and the cohesive fabric of our society."
Absolute bs. Says things that can easily be challenged by using actual sources and proof.
"Amazing speech. Put aside the wit and jokes, he was genuine in his promise to try and speak to the &quot;woke&quot; crowd from a position of understanding their feelings, a position of empathy, and a position of shared values of wanting the best for the world albeit from a differing angle."

woke agenda is a power play by people on the cluster b spectrum - has nothing to do with equality
I tried to leave a comment on his last post yet the people who run u tube wouldn&#39;t let my comment saying 404 server not found so I made a comment saying can&#39;t comment yet that got posted hmmmmmm free speech really we should have free speech when we agree with like this man but not the rubbish going around
what a nerd
superb
"Never heard this word before 5 years ago, never heard anyone say - Sure, Bob can come along, he&#39;s always been woke! It&#39;s a bullshit word! No one used that word until some rightwing internet troll created it and dispersed it. Some young liberals took to it but it really resonates with rightwingers bc it&#39;s a way for them to talk about &quot;gays and blacks&quot; without sounding overtly homophobic or racist. It&#39;s a bullshit word."
super
"Laughter and truth matter. At least Kisin got the laughter right. Homo sapiens are defined by stories, not truth. One story has taken us further than any other. That story has changed our world to the point where &quot;we are in the fight of our lives&quot;. That story is the money story. The problem is not that we have too many left wing nutters or too many right wing nutters or too many &quot;woke&quot; people or too many religious fanatics. The problem is the money story. We need to reconstruct our money story to ensure the survival of Homo sapiens by constructing a story based on Earth&#39;s true currency - air, water, soil, biodiversity and energy. This is a monumental task. It may be that only AI can take us there. We have to recognise that we are an inseparable part of the Earth&#39;s ecosystem. This is the truth that matters more than any other. If Kisin truly cares for his son, he must face this truth now. To all of us, if we truly care for our children and their children and their children and their children, we must face this truth now."

Scott Jennings: Biden Refuted The Entire Thesis Of His Campaign On Friday
So true. Life is not fair get used to it get a hair cut get an education and get a job. Everything comes down to personal responsibility because one day you&#39;re going be standing face to face with God and held responsible whether you like it or not. And that&#39;s why socialists hate God because they don&#39;t want to be held individually responsible.

"One of my clients had been 90% blind from a child and he once said to me that if I ever meet anyone that is more positive than me, I know I have more work to do. Another client was a Thalidomide, and she never complained either. She loved to laugh, joke and have fun, she had so much personality."
What a low-life move.  How do these people tolerate one another?   How do people tolerate themself when they know the impact something so tasteless would have?  Sick.
I’ve got a brother like the handicapped man Mr. Kisin met.  He’s a functional quad who can only push with one leg and has spastic control of one arm.  He also has severe short term memory loss.  He can’t eat by mouth and is fed by a tube.  He has a great attitude and is happy.  It is amazing!

Do we really have to lay this all out? Victim hood? Virtue signalling? Are people that lost that they don’t see this blatant over play of emotional thinking?
"So, let me tell you something, I’m blind, I work and study at the same time, and am on the way to finishing my second university degree, which will take time, but will come at one point in the next 18 months. I speak three languages fluently. I’m a certified teacher of English and give lessons in German as well. I’ve never felt I’m a victim. The only thing I feel is disappointment. I’m disappointed that people less qualified than me get 100 times more attention than I. I’m disappointed because the societal models being promoted today are based on victimhood and not on performance or merit. I have migration background, I have a disability, and none of the above has been ever used to take advantage of circumstances. Never in a job interview, for example, have I mentioned that I have these two things. All of the people I’ve talked to have shown the greatest respect for what I am and what I do, and that is a sign that I should not stop, and I won’t. That is for sure."
"I think a lot of the irony in this statement is religious people usually follow the same mindset.  This is my life because this is what god chose for me so I&#39;m just going to ride it out.  I don&#39;t disagree, It&#39;s just social media isn&#39;t the first thing to make people think this way."
"Many students want to destroy capitalism though it is the opportunity of CHOICE. Socialism is by one&#39;s needs. There is no one forcing people to purchase those things they do not need in capitalism. True capitalists understand they must say NO to the commercials, hawkers and sellers."

"Agency = Personhood.  If you reject accountability and responsibility for your own actions and fate, then you are rejecting your freedom and status as a human being, reducing yourself to a mere resource; a slave at best, compostable biomass at worst.  That narcisistic victimhood mentality not only degrades yourself, but the entire human species."
"The Bulgarian social scientist who specialises in democracy, Ivan krastav, says democracy fails if people don’t believe in their country, in shared values. How could Britain have sunk so low? I hope there is still life in the sinking mother ship."
"Leftards<br>&quot;Climate change is bad!&quot;<br>Society<br>&quot;So do something about it.&quot;<br>Leftards<br>&quot;Hey, I like to virtue signal, I don&#39;t want to be virtuous!&quot;"
"Konstantin exactly specializes on good sounding, but misleading ideas. It is true that people play victims to get attention, but it is also true that people, and kids especially, are oppressed. They feel it, but they can&#39;t explain this properly and incorrectly rationalize this as racism and patriarchy. Just as conservatives incorrectly explain economic depression by immigration. The very fact that people have to pretend they are victims to be at least somewhat successful is exactly showing how broken out society is. There are no other ways for these kids to succeed in our world. Somebody has stolen their future along with their prospects of getting on housing ladder. Did you stole it, Konstantin, with your sweet speeches? Now you come by and essentially say &quot;you&#39;re bad people for playing victims, look at that disabled dude, you should be ashamed&quot;. I don&#39;t think you even understand how devastating and evil your message is. Fix the problem, not the &quot;bad&quot; kids who respond to the problem."
… people are taking responsibility for their own lives… by convincing others they are victims of crime. This guy retarded.
"Thats the big difference, real &quot;victims&quot; dont wanna be seen as a victim. People who wanna be seen as a victim are faking it for their own narcism"

"Except this isn&#39;t a Liberal thing. Conservatives LOVE to nail themselves to the cross and do it all the time. . . ironically, with wokeism as the big bogeyman. I&#39;m no fan either (I just loathe the concept of thought policing) but they&#39;re just as if not more screechy than the woke liberals. They&#39;re literally flip sides of the same coin. Hell, both these guys have basically made a career of playing to it. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so uncomfortable for KK to talk about Ukraine, because if he&#39;s honest he&#39;s going to piss off all his subscribers. At least here in the US."
"When you cater to and caudal stupid, you will always get more of it."
"the last thing that anyone with a disability wants is for anyone to think of them as a victim, shit happened thats life they got on and dealt with it, the vast majority of these so called &quot;victims&quot; these days are just cries for attention and hustles for free handouts"
"Everyone is a victim today. I am a victim, give me money and free stuff."
So well said.
Well that just shits on everybody who has been abused and wronged in some way. Guess these people are abuser enablers?
"KK puts across Israel as victims, and they had no other real option but to kill thousands of women and children.  He is disingenuous and has an agenda, which is that the oppressed and those that are being wronged should put up and shut up, and he extends this to the UK and West.  In the west too, we have corrupt politicians who serve Zionist interests and that of their clique&#39;s above the massess.  Income inequality is at its greatest as is absolute poverty.  Otherwise, we are all in agreement that blaming the other for every single failing as individuals or as society and not taking responsibility makes matters worse."
Victims getting attention tell that to the victims of grooming gangs
We are breeeding psychopathic children ... That they are the most important thing on the planet .....
"The most determination I&#39;ve ever seen in a person comes from people with cerebral palsy. Imagine having a perfectly working brain, but your body just doesn&#39;t want to listen to it and do its own thing."
"Your statement that religion has been a bad thing in human history (your other speech), is fundamentally wrong. In the whole, religion has been a net benefit, as it has engendered morals an ethics in the human diaspora."
"The problem with rewarding, and then debasing, &quot;victimhood&quot;, is that it takes away from actual victims, those who have been systematically repressed due to their disadvantages, whether that&#39;s a disability, their skin colour, their social background, or simply down to the fact they don&#39;t have a voice in the constant clamour that is the woke far left vs the non-existent far right rhetoric.  Thus we end up with an over-privileged, brainwashed majority who think that their imagined struggles and first world problems deserve more attention and remedy than those who are victims of the generational oppression caused by the ancestral power of these privileged classes."
Dark skinned?  Maybe in Sweden.
Most real victims hate to be seen or percived like victims.
Being an oppressed victim is &quot; fun &quot; ?
Konstantin Kisin hombre.
"When you are a victim, nothing can change. It is only when you become an active participant that you can choose your path."
Wow…..what this really screwed up world desperately needs is more people like this amazing fellow Konstantin.
Was raised well by smart parents and went to exceptional schools. Took advantage of that and would like to think I spread it around. Not for me to say...
And right wingers do the same saying the leftists are ruining your world so fight them rather than finding solutions and working with each other.
"There is some truth to the social benefit of the victimhood narrative. But Jordan Peterson has earned fame and fortune telling young people to clean their bedroom and take responsibility for your life. Fortunately, most humans admire heroes (however flawed) not victims."
Jordan Peterson<br><br>Looks different 😂
"I first observed this ~ 15 years when pseudoscience conmen began to garner massive followings on social media. They offered simple, grandiose wrong answers to scientific problems that led their lazy audience to believe that everything they hadn&#39;t be bothered to learn at school was wrong anyway and they were now ahead of actual scientists because they were &#39;open-minded&#39; enough to listen to these charlatans. 15 years later that same formula used by the pseudoscience conmen is now being applied to virtually everything online."
Watch “Sound of Freedom” and see real oppression and real ‘mental health issues.’
"KK is right in principle , but there is a danger of domination of Right wing think which I do not believe is good, A big straw man with the ultra privalged Oxford students, but there are still desperate caualties in our world..  ,People in a deap hole not of thier own making , eg a child from a drug or alcohol dominated familly..  Yes some characters can beat that, at least superfiscially, but we are all of different clay and for many it is not possible ,,We must seek the middle line or ground on this , Victimhood culture widespread is certainly bad, but no victim damaged persons is also a bad way ..  WE should not allow the &quot;winners and losers &quot; to get too far apart ,, That in the long run not good for the &quot; winners&quot; or the &quot; losers &quot; .."
Lgbt ideology etc is more harmful than communism to the human being than the ussr was
Just a beautiful yet tragic sentiment of our contemporary society 😢
It&#39;s easier to fail because your the victim than trying your best and fail.Its always because of your colour or race or gender or ethnicity not because you didn&#39;t make the grade.This turns into a culture that people subconsciously or deliberately make it happen..<br>Kids from low income families and deprived areas are often brought up in homes with unemployed parents living on social handouts.These areas usually have high crime rates and having a criminal record is almost a badge of honour.. the kids are told they will never get a decent job because of where they live and attend a notorious school... with that in mind they don&#39;t care about school and have more emotional connection with the gang they run with than family..... to get the clothes and shoes ( far above the amount parents can afford) they turn to crime which gains them a police record and reduces the chance of a good job...... it&#39;s a never ending cycle that begins with being told thay have no chance of getting on because &quot;THEY WON&#39;T LET YOU&quot; ..... victims of the culture of victimisation.....
All truth can cause discomfort to the lazy thinker.
Ian Dury was very disabled and never ever complained about his situation.  He even had to be carried onto the stage sometimes because if his condition.
Konstantins suit ... 👌
"It&#39;s called positive feedback loop - get a little attention, social media amplifies the attention and now other people will subscribe to the behavior or beliefs that garner attention. Which leads to a wave of people acting in concert with stupidity."
"social validation feedback loop <br><br>As a recovering addict, out of all the drugs I&#39;ve used, or seen the effects of,<br>- the Like button is by far the worst, hands down...<br><br>No other drug has been as detrimental to society as the Social validation feedback Loop has.<br><br>- love to ALL, feel no hate"
I think one of the best speeches I&#39;ve heard!  Thankyou Konstantin.
Did this man just say “I’m dark skinned”??!!😂😂😂 Dudes as white as space ghost.
George So ros is behind most of these dysfunctional social trends.
Oooooooo9oo9ooooooooooo
When truth becomes controversial stupidity is seizing the day.
Thanks Konstantin you are an example to us all especially considering how tough you had it in your impoverished childhood and all😅
"the more attention, the more 💵💵"
I love Konstantin Kisin. He is very bright …..he really seems able to easily see the faults/weaknesses in peoples arguments.  That’s why I don’t get into those debates with people. I can’t come up with a good counter argument until an hour later 😒.  It’s frustrating. Plus I’ve internalized white guilt for years….so I just shut myself up.
"Then why are you Kostya darling allowing your beloved Ukrainian Loyalists ( I&#39;m not gonna say &quot; Nazis &quot; because MI- 6 knows I&#39;ve got Loyalist friends of my own and I love them dearly ) all the victimhood they could ever desire? Why are you peddling the &quot; Ukraine is good, Russia is pure evil &quot; garbage that insults your considerable intelligence and makes you look like a shill- not a brilliant scholar. Why are you doing this?"
I absolutely hate this but I&#39;m with Kostya 120%.
"Sometimes it feels like pulling teeth, but is sanity and common sense finally working its way back into the western world today? We need more and more people like this to come out of the shadows, grab us by the back of the neck and ram our heads into a brick wall to wake us up."
Wow
"I&#39;ve ways found the most disadvantaged people, physically and mentally disabled people, often look at themselves with the least victimhood and have the most drive. <br>Why? Because they have to be to survive. <br>The problem is woke lefties that keep on telling them they are useless and can&#39;t achieve anything by themselves."
Feeling good not the same as Being good.
True hardship builds character.
"We have done young people a great disservice over the past 50 years because we have allowed this victim mentality, and this fantasy world to develop to the point where so many people think that it’s actually real.  We now have young men walking around, thinking that they’re women. We have young actresses going around getting their breasts removed (Ellen Page) so they can look like men. We have millions of black kids who think that slavery happened because of racism. They don’t even know that in the early days of world slavery, people didn’t bring in slaves from other continents. The slaves and the slaveowners were virtually identical people. The first slaves in America were Irish. The ignorance goes on and on, and the reason it goes on and on is because the ignorance is serving a narrative."

Konstantin always speaks common sense a very articulate and interesting man.
F**k off whiners
Excellently put
Konstantin thinks he has dark skin? Funny. ;)
"I will never ask for your contact info in the comments section, that is someone impersonating me!"
Dudes a wokie. Can&#39;t take criticism of you know what. <br><br>It was funny to watch all these guys fall right in line. Hilarious
The emphasis in ‘freedom’ and ‘individual’ as superior western ideas is so self indulgent and culturally centric.
They will never be happy <br>They don’t consider them selves capeble
Love  Konstantine is right!<br>We created victims is a a diminishing self worth!<br>And deserves to do less<br>It is a positive to work and aspire to!<br>Communism disables. <br>Suffering we can overcome and not be <br>Victims because you have no <br>Aspiration but you have expectations <br>That’s our society has stopped functioning
We have fat homeless people. Poverty is not that.

I remember 20 some years ago I was talking to a university girl and she said she’s a victim because she’s because she’s white and rich and her dad never spent enough time with her because he was a high-powered lawyer so she’s a victim. Boo-hoo.
Dictatorship would be very lonely !

And they are just too unqualified for their positions."
"Woke dogma  is a mixture of Neo Marxism, black supremacism and primacy of perversion in  our culture."
Contains a huge lie from usual Russophobic Hebrew - that Putin without hesitation sent Russians into Ukraine.  That&#39;s a lie - Putin DESPERATELY tried to negotiate peace - entering into FOUR peace deals. ALL rejected by American masters and their Ukranian puppets. That&#39;s a fact.
Wasn&#39;t the &#39;life is suffering&#39; line from Scott Peck?
Our spiritual essence is more foundational than the ego
First off this would not happen if a majority of people would not take part in woke culture... Even the conservatives are woke now days... Sheeple the lot of you! When you have the sinning going on in churches you got... And the greedy that is abundantly present on the red side of things... You get the &quot;woke&quot; culture on the blue side of things... <br><br>This is not rocket science people! You want this to stop... Then stop being so woke! And actually wake up!
&quot;Woke culture&quot; i.e. regular culture is being threatened by MAGA sleep culture.
Pile of crap
I am a victim. Now show me the money..<br>Lots of it!<br>NOW!
Woke was brewed up 30 years ago the #1 intent....destroy America from within
"Chinese collectivism allows for much individualism, same way conservatives are far more tolerant of differences n don&#39;t force on their opinions. The concept embodies ultimately the idea of the cosmological self, cultivated thro society. N philosophical daoism runs parallel in influence to this, and  moves away from societal rules, so internally many chinese do not lock on to rules, they flow w what is given."
"Atheists.<br>The fool has said in his heart there is no GOD.<br>Only a fool would push gender fluidity,which is all the rave in the atheist Marxist democratic socialist community."
Tom talks too much.
Idiots are not taking over the world they&#39;ve already done it.<br>Thing about idiots they don&#39;t see whats around the corner 😂
Ah the talking heads… what is this like two cia tapped celebrities trying to make the world hunky dory?
I feel like most of these trains of thought work for the West with the exception of the West treatment of Africa and Africans globally. I’m actually amazed how much was said while completely avoiding the West brutal relationship with Africa for nearly a millennium.
KONSTANTIN BEST INTERVIEWS!!!!<br>🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️
What a great conversation. Thank You.
"Konstantin is so clear and has so much clarity in his words, he says so much using simple and few words while staying focused on the point. The host on the other hand says so little using complex words in a over drawn out babble of words that rambles on and on to the point of losing focus."
"It beats being taken over by the WEIRD RIGHT CRAZIIES who want to control how you have sex in whom you have sex with, control over women&#39;s bodies, legalize racism, and when it comes to shutting down free speech, they make the wokey left look like amateurs."
The smarter a person gets the more evil he becomes
"Just to be clear about the idea that says that is good is that which works, there&#39;s no moral content to that which works. Pragmatism is a distinctly American philosophy that has some merit; however, if that which works is evil, then that which works cannot be the good. Pragmatism (ism is a suffix for a life and worldview). If an ism is attached an idea, that idea is a philosophical assertion for truth. If something works now will it work at all times? No, it does not. That which works is often temporal and creates other problems exponentially. Pragmatism is abscessed with solving problems but never considers the long term consequence. Does that sound familiar in our government that keeps kicking the can down the road to later solve it when it creates a more serious problem. <br><br>Sorry people but life is going to be difficult and no amount of that which works is going to ultimately solve those problems. That means we are continually responding to problems created a previous problems that created several more problems.<br><br>Now for this super structure idea, that is way over simplified. To have some value are sacred then that value must be eternally true. If a value is only of human preference, it will not ever be an ultimate value. All values must be measured by an ultimate source that has the power to enforce those values ultimately. If there is no consequence ultimately, then all values are temporal and I may pursue my own personal interest and use any means to attain it. If the wicked prosper then wickedness works, right? Then again if there is no ultimate value then good and evil do not exist. That which works has many avenues for that which is good. The good is that which humans say is good."
All of these woke ideas inclusion victimhood feeling good at all costs without actually being good. They all stem from the women being raised to positions of power they will give up the fight for what is right for what is feels good every time. To women the only thing that matters is don&#39;t be mean which means don&#39;t tell the truth don&#39;t look at problems don&#39;t point out anything that&#39;s abnormal. We&#39;re all in this together we&#39;re all love we need to cherish each other&#39;s experience. And none of this absolutely none of it as a position in the hierarchies of our society. These ideas are meant to be at home in our families and carried out into the world and used in the decision processes for doing battle in business or life these are the underlying values that make us human they are not values that you can lead a society success. Running a society with these values will lead to failure and destruction and dominance by others.
"The problem with pseudointellectuals like this guy is that they&#39;re actually much more concern about sounding smart with their righteous-English language but  they ends-up failing because they&#39;re simultaneously ignoring their target enemy&#39;s different perspective and motivation that generates the narrative.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXEnSX_aRRE&amp;t=875"">14:35</a> The problem with that individualist&#39;s &quot;you matter&quot; is the fact that the Christianity&#39;s scapegoatism is still being use by those individualistic people by treating the other &quot;perceived-incompetent&quot; as the &quot;obvious&quot; sacrifice through torturing the target with social condemnation.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXEnSX_aRRE&amp;t=128"">2:08</a> The only reason why you feel that &quot;this kind of thing is going to arise at certain times in history&quot; is because of the immature western culture, which is the byproduct of the failure of western civilization to developed sophisticated collective therapeutic spiritual disciplines in the long-term... because of the destructive geopolitical influence of the Dark Ages."
Woke people are not using weaponized empathy because they don&#39;t care about empathy because they&#39;re actually being pretentious concern toward the other people people that they perceived to &quot;deserve better&quot;. It&#39;s narcissistic compassion that is driving their motivation.
Kisin the clown will not be taking anything over.

"I feel like woke culture is draining me of my soul, as much as the society of the 2020s."
watching from Arizona.
question for konstantin: did the suicides of prison guards take place immediately after the death of stalin or after the khrushchev &quot;secret speech&quot; 3 years later? i&#39;ve read solzhenitsyn and he seems unclear on the point.
"Zionism is more dangerous than Nazism because: You cannot distinguish who is a Jew and who is a Zionist. Who is playing offer who is Zionist.<br>They exploit the Holocaust card and the antisemitism card. Christian Zionists claim they are helping Jews. Christian Zionism is an extreme ideology that supports Israel, seeing it as fulfilling biblical prophecy for Jesus&#39;s Second Coming, Armageddon, and the judgment of non-Christians. Jewish Zionists say they are a minority, and the majority of Zionists are Christian. Very few people have the time to understand what Zionism truly is. The power of Zionism lies in its ability to corrupt representatives in Western countries with money, making them support the colonialist state and even banning TikTok from criticizing Israel. Zionists have big control over media, from newspapers to radio, TV, YouTube, and Facebook. Israeli Zionists kill and attack any place in the West and then retreat to Israel. Zionists can ruin your career almost anywhere in the West by labeling you as antisemitic."
Really good episode. Thank you
We are seeing the cons of democracy. It great but once fools take charge counties and empires fall
Thank you
"What is not working is bringing on poverty to all America--we do not have it so good  and it is getting worse, not better.  Poverty is reality and all your woke talk doesn&#39;t  make anything better."

The panels with tape are the distracting  flaw of an otherwise well designed set
It&#39;s all about threats to the economy.
Sounds like Tom is putting on guests to confirm Tom&#39;s belief.  This is so below the contents he was producing 5 years ago.  What bunk!
Like watching two blind guys play darts What is this &quot;spark of divinity&quot; ?  And the idea behind the constitution is not unnatural in the slightest . Think of   A father and his children and you will understand
Bilyou claiming he knew lots of people who were poor is ridiculous - &quot; I was a big brother to a kid that lived IN Compton&quot; =   LOL  First of all Compton is not poor and I&#39;m not sure it ever was - I moved there as a teen for a brief period and what amazed me when I got there is how much money they had (nasty people and poverty of the soul - yeah that&#39;s a different story)  secondly he is not old enough to have seen it at its worst.  It was way better by the time he was old enough to be a Big Brother.<br>Pretty much everybody from major urban areas has never seen real economic poverty or poor people

"I was looking for this video earlier, and found the flipside version of it with Tom on Triggernometry. That one was fantastic. I was going back to listen to it again and this one popped up."
"There needs to be equality of opportunity. However, the issue is that the idea of a meritocracy is being abandoned in favour of social engineering. A DEI actor doesn&#39;t necessarily have talent or charisma. An all female cast is not a recipe for on-screen magic. An all-black games studio is not guaranteed to produce good games. Individual aspects like talent, imagination and charisma are crucial as well as the personal will to hone skills and gain experience over many years. This is all being cast aside in the name of forced equality. This tide must be turned before it ruins us. The western entertainment industry is probably beyond saving now but the rot is spreading. Do you want a heart surgeon that knows what they are doing or are you happy with a diversity hire? There is already talk of hiring airline pilots on the basis of diversity quotas......"
No other state played the victim role like the Jewish. People got killed by the millions during the human history.

"I know this will be an unpopular comment and will get me mocked but...<br><br>When talking about covid and its said that it wasn&#39;t that spreadable, it wasn&#39;t a big deal, it was about authoritarian behaviour etc, this is a poor take in my opinion.<br><br>My wife and I observed the rules. We stayed in. We didn&#39;t mingle. We got through about 1.5 years covid free. We then went out to london one night. Our first night actually going somewhere congested with no mask or anything. We travelled by train on the saturday and travelled home on sunday. On Monday we both had covid. Not one of us, it was both of us. That is a spreadable disease/illness/sickness or whatever. We don&#39;t know how we got it. Was it from a person? The hotel we stayed in? Something we touched? Impossible to know. Now of course you may argue the effect of covid. For a few days we felt terrible. Could&#39;t sleep, eat etc. But we got over it, we didn&#39;t die. However, when it first happened in the world people were, supposedly, dying. So you take the fact that yeah, something spreads via all sorts of unknown means and it can potentially kill you. What do you do?<br><br>If you own a shop and there is an issue with a gas leak, you know its going to have a terrible effect on people exposed. You might die, you might not. But you know its there and you need to make sure your people are safe. Do you send them home to keep them safe and away from danger until the issue is resolved or do you make them go home and be safe while you fix it? the former is the obvious choice even if you are responsible for only 2-3 people. Government is responsible for protecting millions and billions.<br><br>At the time I feel the governments, who we like to say are responsible for our safety (thats not deniable, we expect government to serve us and ensure we get what we need to survive and uphold how we expect our country to be maintained) made the sensible choice. It was a difficult time where none of us would know what to do. Its fine to look back and say &quot;i would have done this&quot; but would you? When you are in it, its a different matter and most of us do not know the feeling or pressure of being responsible for billions of people."
So many times KK starts interviewing Tom 😆 great video!
I LOVED this conversation!
"Funny how Tom thinks he has seen poverty up close.. and proceeds to describes a home, refrigerator and air conditioning but bad neighborhood 😆 cracks me up. This is definitely the description of poverty in the USA. For most parts of the world this description is an upper middle class. I was born and raised by a single mom in a room that was our bedroom, kitchen, living room &amp; bathroom with no refrigerator or AC. Anyways... whatever your definition of poverty is, the truth is WE CAN ALL GET OUT OF IT, BETTER OURSELVES &amp; CONTRIBUTE TO THE WORLD . ✌️♥️<br>Thank you TOM for sharing this with us."
It all boils down to wealth inequality and corruption. People just don&#39;t know what to point their fingers at.
"The best analogy I have seen: many progressives have Munchausen’s syndrome, or Munchausen’s by proxy. America is like the child who was being poisoned by her mother in the movie Sixth Sense. The mother gets addicted to the attention and sympathy she gets for seeming to be a “caring” figure. So addicted that she ignores the fact that she is hurting the child, killing her ultimately. The poison is wokeism and DEI. It has not proven to be effective; if anything it’s been proven to be the opposite, destructive even. The mother is all the progressives, academics, and people who are addicted to the attention, sympathy, and other benefits (academic, professional, social, and otherwise) that they get for either claiming to be oppressed, or advocating for others who fit that description. They have total disregard for the consequences; in fact they have, through cancel culture, shut down any discussion, much less debate. People respond to incentives; it’s almost understandable in that context. But given the hysteria, and the destructiveness to our society, it’s time to push back."
I&#39;m a Christian and a recently graduated chaplain from college. This forum needs to be heard in the faith based community
"&#39;men need sex to feel loved and women need love to have sex&#39;<br>I imagine men don&#39;t feel loved since becoming the boon of western society jokes, hence porn addictions?"
All men are created equal does not equate to every human having divinity. That is a twisting of the Christian teaching that all men are created in the image of God which does not equal divinity.<br> That is an old Christian heresy from the time of the early Christian church. It is because the US stopped being protestant but kept parts of the teaching which allowed it to come back as neo-gnosticism.
"I just realized how different the rest of the west is from the USA in relation to the <a href=""http://left.in/"">left.In</a> most other western countries the real left is low income workers with a few highly educated members and some college students.The bulk of it is mostly working class that struggles everyday.And the workers certainly ain&#39;t <a href=""http://woke.so/"">woke.So</a> their main reason for being left is entirely different than the USA.Anyways, watched hundreds of hours of JP,Murray,Haris etc etc,and ll of em have character flaws.But Kisin....I cant find any faults to his character,he has become my favorite very fast."
"IF TOM SOWELL IS SO LEGIT THEN GET HIM ON YOUR SHOW. HE&#39;s 93!!! Cummon guys, stop ducking him. How many times has Kneel Tyson been on Rogan? TOM SOWELL HASN&#39;T BEEN ON ROGAN ONCE!!! Get Tom Sowell on your show!"
Look how many lawsuits the left have against Donald Trump an ex President who is running against the current administration for election. This is unprecedented election interference and persecution of a political opponent.
and that is why i reject most christians. they wont or cant be soldiers or warriors ..unlike the evil islamics ..i suggested merging the two cults but it didnt get any traction.
and if you know its my coffin and Gay the Devil put a hell programme into the sphere that runs it you know why evil [God] is so much stronger than any number of good men...what then? you are right being moral is good. but under HIM it makes you food.  the only possible recourse is battle.
yes the pendulum is wildly unbalanced.  Gay always chose Tragedy but i chose Comedy. now he is beaten but the CIA is determined to make me crash. so i think we will wind up with a really off the wall surreal kafka or dostoevski.
Sensitivity is the millennials drug
"Kisin has hit the nail on the head about what differentiates the west from all other cultures - individualism / individual liberty / individual freedom. It has taken the west quite far. But I think this idea is running on fumes now.<br><br>The better system is to have individual rights AND duties. Rights without duties will lead to anarchy. <br><br>And the reason why such anarchy is only rearing its head in the west now is because, for the past 100 years, people inherently understood the importance of taking responsibilities, even though no one was shoving on them. But now, people have forgotten the importance of taking responsibilities along with the rights given to them by their society."
Incredible guest! He and Jordan Peterson have been thee best so far!
It is weaponized!
"Tom, if life is simply an accident of chemical reactions then by definition there is nothing &quot;sacred&quot; about life. You can&#39;t have it both ways."
Konstantin talks about Russians fighting wars for the monarchy. Who the hell does he think the American military is fighting war after war after war for? These are clearly imperialist wars fought by the poor for the rich. Konstantin might be an expert on Russia but he&#39;s got a lot to learn about the west.
Social media needs to go
"The way to deal with woke people is to refuse to converse with them on their terms, just tell them you will only talk on your terms, then you control the situation and no one needs to be offended by anything said, if the other person refuses this, just politely excuse yourself from their company."
The error is in assuming theyre bright minds because they go to Oxford lol. they are the most brainwashed that i would agree
It all starts at school you brainwash them when they are young and naive because they will believe anything you tell them it’s called indoctrination wake up
I love Konstantin.

"You do not have to defeat the woke people  just ignore them, Stupidity always disappears over time so no problem."
"Its not the woke mentality alone, it is the right&#39;s inhibiting the very progress he apparently champions. Perhaps he&#39;s too young to remember  Jimmy Carter and putting the symbolic solar panels on the roof of the white house. Symbolizing the need for progress, the very progress Kisin  proclaims in this speech, was undermined by the Reagan Administration who as his first act in office was to remove this very symbol of progress now we are 40 years behind and then to defund the departments that worked to enhance clean energy. Don&#39;t blame wokism nor the poverty in South America and Asia, blame the right leaners for destroying progress which put the US 40 years behind the 8 Ball. While wokism has its issues the right is the true cancel culture of alternate energy. They weren&#39;t around during the failed Reagan administration."
That selfie sealed it 🤦‍♂️ Konstatin is a right GRIFTER! Piers left ITV on his own …. What a pair of Karens! Woke and Anti-woke are profiteering off stupid views!

The problem is the Woke don’t understand that they have corrupted their own brains. They don’t even see themselves as Woke and try to dismiss being called woke by saying it’s old and stupid. Just call them Neo-Woke that got corrupted from their original goals of working towards a common good for the oppressed and under represented  to hateful fascist racist for their own power.
The nice thing about this is that it gives you the hope that maybe the world won&#39;t turn into an insanely perverted place because of the woke.  It&#39;s terrifying.
"Question: why do we not offer to send (these so-called woke people), them to a country that better represent what the want, and offer that country (China, Russia and any other socialist and fascist country) a swap, we will take the ones who want to live in a democratic and free country."

Quite bigoted to the like of Piers and Kisin himself to abuse &#39;woke&#39; people. Do they even exist? Can someone seriously say that they subscribe to the &#39;woke&#39; mentality? Projection.
A brilliant speech by any standards. Thanks Konstantin.
great speech
I question climate change. Car&#39;s get the blame and hammer for climate change however very little is said of planes. Holiday makers around the world including cruising gets a free pass
"Thank You Piers Morgan for once again proving that your Channel is the place of safety, normality and comfort for the number of ordinary people that suddenly in todays world hsve been left outside and dont have many other spaces or just a home like this one-the home of freedom and logic in general factual thinking and intelligent and kind but powerful discussions.<br>So important today-in this overwhelming run of information and completely subjective, repeatedly blind against the ones of others and often aggressive and totally new or baseless narratives from multiple sides.<br><br>Thank You Mr. Piers Morgan and Mr. Konstantin ❤️👏💡<br>We all feel good being able to listen to such smart and educated adults but also and first of all just the non populistic and reflecting the common sense people 👍"
"i used to do drugs.  i still do, i just used to, too!"
As someone from eastern europe who also dealt with communism until a few 3 decades ago this is what the western world doesnt realize.<br><br>They dont realizes how dangerous this insane censorship can get because these idiots dont actually know what it means to actually live under an opressive government.<br><br>These phucken losers believe being mosgendered is opression for example
"The main thing is to save  energy! Ever thought of that? ?  Begin with private air condition at home, or in cars. Move your asses, instead of takin the car. Etc.."
"The idea that we are ruining the world is an old one.  Even the Bible in Revelations, God said he would destroy those &quot;ruining the Earth&quot;.  The problem is the way the &quot;woke&quot; crowd decides to do it.  The fact is that they don&#39;t have real power to enact change, they have no actual vote.  They can pressure companies to go along for a short time, but those companies will never change the fundamental core of how they pollute just to please this generations loud hippies.<br><br>  Of course if the world doesn&#39;t act, they can&#39;t complain if God does return to save us from ourselves, right when we are about to go extinct for not stopping the global damage to the planet.  I&#39;m not sure if it will happen in my lifetime, but so far the world is getting worse, more pollution can not be a good thing.  The Earth is finite and it can&#39;t take an infinite amount of abuse without there being consequences."
Loved his speech when I saw the whole of it. Another great interview Piers.
People don&#39;t ever acknowledge how perceptive a comedian has to be to create a routine.
Piers is still kind of an ass though … Declaring where Konstantin is going to film HIS OWN show.
"My name is Mahyar Radmehr, charged in August 2023 and facing 5 years in prison in Canada for having created a website exposing a female serial accuser by the name Sheida Khosroshahi with legally obtained documents who has charged and displaced men since 1997..Run the name sheida khosroshahi on Google  and see for yourself."
"Also, the Internet doesn&#39;t help by spreading this type of nonsense."
"Compare the brilliance of his speech in its entirety, with the several hundred televised versions of Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion word salad offerings - as nutritious as a can of spam or a box of kraft dinner. <br>Konstantin Kisin is a remarkable example of a true and powerful cultural diversity, the kind that made the west through most of the 20th century such a cornucopia of freedom of thought. <br>Great discussion, guys. Only wish it had extended longer. Needs another round or two."
It’s an amazing reality that the best comedy is the ridiculous Truth.  That’s why liberals fear memes.
"Piers Morgan always complains about the woke culture, yet he went super woke with Tommy Robinson about Islam. I have never heard him criticize how the woke culture empowering Islamic terrorism, not only towards the West, but towards Muslims and former Muslims who are part of the Islamic world even if they left it and are still a persecuted minority. Even in the UK by their Muslim families. Piers Morgan is either afraid of Muslims or he is a hypocrite"
"The problem with these types of free speech idiots is they take no personal responsibility for what they say. Most are really dumb, wokeness is about the equality of all, including speech, thought, expression and existence. It is not about cancelling, unlike these numbskulls advocating a few grifting words."
"The &#39;cleanest&#39; energy source ever devised is that derived from fossil fuels. It&#39;s staggering how brainwashed we&#39;ve become, demonizing carbon, carbon! the constituent element of all life on Earth! And to achieve the asinine goal of &#39;net zero&#39;  carbon emissions we&#39;ll chop down ALL trees, severely reduce arable land devoted to agriculture, relocate rural populations to  cities ... It&#39;s astonishing how destructive such plans are to Earth&#39;s environment, and it&#39;s being done deliberately."
"The first thing you have to do, is recognise your enemy.  WHO, is not only responsible for introducing it, BUT, who is feeding this sickness? And take it from there."
"Republicans criticize their own side a lot! Too much! As Rush used to say, “Democrats circle the wagons and Republicans shoot their wounded.”"
It will be interesting when these people get into the work place and start running for politics and change try to laws to meet their beliefs and realize it is not that easy.
We will absolute defeat wokeness.
"It&#39;s a cultural revolution, Maoism with western elements."
"people who dont believe in their selves ,ussualy go for some woke group of people to feel better ,but they cant see that theyre just brainwashed and lost ,my message love youre self and believe in yourself and you will look alot better in others eyes ,dont sell your soul to self loving people who wants world to bend"
Now after all that What are they going to do in the meantime  how many years will it take  all countries  will have to  be together about this A real challenge
Brilliant makes sense really impressed
"Wokeness, hopefully will be all gone within 4-5 years."
"If you go woke you go broke and stupid, not logical thinking, not an individual thinking is just have one learn speach that you repeat all over with no  opinion of your own cuz this is not your idea is a bad route that make you belive you are a victim and that you have to love just like that amd not try to be better just cry over all and mekw the rest equally stupid to follow. No thanks i like my brain and critical thinking."
The West is becoming far left. The communist Bolsheviks are in power. <br><br>Unless their is a reincarnation of Adolf Hitler it&#39;s going to get worse
🎉Thank You!!! YES!! Post Woke!! YES!! Pretty Stupid!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🤩
Can’t wait for that collaboration between the two of you 🙌🙌🙌
Human gas is loaded with greenhouse gases.  For God’s sake….STOP FARTING!!!
The woke mob are communists/ Marxists. Plain and simple.
Konstantin is fighting against the woke culture and therefore he deserves everyone&#39;s supports for that matter.
He is saying Latin America and Asia are responsible for environmental issue. Hope this idiot gets some history lesson with fact. Your so-called west manufacturing is done in Asia and Latin America.
Woke will destroy itself. Fanatics always do. Just a question of how many they take down with them...
He the of the bat that poor people couldn&#39;t give a f about saving the planet. The audacity.
"keen insights, robust arguments and irrefutable logic"
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
guy looks like the anoerexic vladimir klitschko
Great debate!
"Morgan is crying woke because people like him no longer have absolute monopoly of the media like before.<br>People now can freely express their own view on social media and be heard unlike when the MSM had absolute power to control people’s mind.<br>He’s not used to being challenged or opposed to, opposing his views easily translates to being CANCELLED.<br>Megan merkel issue and the Ukrainian-Russian war is an example of that."
"There&#39;s such a Sinister feeling to it all. And I always wondered who funds these people where do they get their money? Someone has to pay for transportation, t-shirts signs bull horns. Follow the money who funds them? I&#39;d love to know <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voMaVTqL1OQ&amp;t=367"">6:07</a>"
"More and more everyday, all those rumors I heard about a new world order seem to be materializing right before my eyes. It is so obvious that the self-appointed ruling class leftist activist and they&#39;re poor victimized voters that have been lied to for decades. Thanks for speaking out you&#39;re a wonderful sensible man. You&#39;re okay to pierce wink <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voMaVTqL1OQ&amp;t=278"">4:38</a>"
"I noticed this was posted 4 months ago. Is this wonderful man still around? Or have the leftist destroyed him yet😢 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voMaVTqL1OQ&amp;t=94"">1:34</a>"
I support the speakers on educating youth rather than demonizing them. Woke culture has done nothing but harm. I do disaree with the comment on carbon footprint though. The reason why Asia and South America are responsible for high carbon emission is because North America and Europe has shifted majority of their production to these countries for reduced cost.
He seems woke to me an activist discussing a practical solution to climate change
"Republicans want to control where you shop, where you eat, what you can buy, what to think and who you can make live to. It is 1930’s Germany."
You can’t defeat something if you don’t even know what it is or should even be defeated.
"I&#39;m not woke, but I&#39;m a leftist. And he&#39;s spitting bullshit that only morons would actually take for facts. First of all, making changes to the way we consume is what would bring positive climate change, the west is the biggest consumer of Chinese products. So the West is indeed responsible for China being the biggest polluter in the world. And if the West had any good intentions, they would boycott products that are not responsibly produced. And that would actually make China prosper even more as they can start selling these products at higher margins. These studies that show the biggest polluters in the world don&#39;t take into account when a country contributes to another countries pollution. For example, the biggest consumer of Chinese products is the US. Therefore, the US should be considered the biggest polluter and not China."
"Thank You So Much For Watching And STAAAY BLESSED :)<br>If You are interested in my book full of short stories it is available now !<br><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPQYT3WH"">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPQYT3WH</a><br><a href=""https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0BPQYT3WH"">https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0BPQYT3WH</a>"
"We in the UK have ABSOLUTE MORAL OBLIGATION TO LEAD SUSTAINABILITY /GREEN REVOLUTION. BRITAIN STARTED INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, HAS APPROPRIATED MUCH MORE THAN MOST COUNTRIES OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES THAN MOST COUNTRIES SINCE THEN, DESTROYED MUCH MORE TOO, AND IS WASTING ITS POTENTIAL ON CREATING BXXSHIT ECONOMY, VIRTUAL ECONOMY, ON MINDLESS CONSUMERISM."
"My theory is they tell us it&#39;s hotter, we think its hotter, and so it gets hotter.<br><br>We are programmed to manifest these temperatures. We create those temperatures with our thoughts."
How is climate change &quot;woke culture&quot;????
"Fuck the planet! (GB is 2% of TODAYS emissions, amazing how he forgets how they got RICH."
That&#39;s why wizards that will figure out how to make clean energy cheaply are greater than the prophets that prescribe inefficient protesting.
most important speech in the last 6 months ever!
"This should be shown to the New Zealand government.  And ex Prime minister Jacinda Ardern.  She tried to be St Greta of Thundaberg greatest campaigner, companion. Stupid b#$ch. So many people lost jobs , and they imported crap stuff from overseas cos it was cheaper."
This guy knocks it right out of the park… Superbly spoken….
The music is disturbing.
"Laughter and truth matter. At least Kisin got the laughter right. Homo sapiens are defined by stories, not truth. One story has taken us further than any other. That story has changed our world to the point where &quot;we are in the fight of our lives&quot;. That story is the money story. The problem is not that we have too many left wing nutters or too many right wing nutters or too many &quot;woke&quot; people or too many religious fanatics. The problem is the money story. We need to reconstruct our money story to ensure the survival of Homo sapiens by constructing a story based on Earth&#39;s true currency - air, water, soil, biodiversity and energy. This is a monumental task. It may be that only AI can take us there. We have to recognise that we are an inseparable part of the Earth&#39;s ecosystem. This is the truth that matters more than any other. If Kisin truly cares for his son, he must face this truth now. To all of us, if we truly care for our children and their children and their children and their children, we must face this truth now."
Konstantin is one of the great men
It’s Sherlock!
"At the 4 minute mark, why did you edit the speech.  In his actual speech, after he said that “about 15 months ago my wife got pregnant”, he followed that with a comical line that she got pregnant, not him, because they are old fashioned.  What’s wrong with that statement?  People in the hall laughed, I did too.  It’s strange that someone edited the line out."
"so if I am going to distill his argument down, it would read something like, fix poverty through technology and that will do a lot to curbing the advance of what he perceives as the negative effects of climate change?  Am I hearing him right and not getting myself all confused?  great....then he better hope that technology helps us skip the step where the poor of china and India get cheap cars....In the extraordinarily short history of the human race when have technological breakthroughs EVER been either CLEAN or CHEAP?   This is a load of bollocks.  I am nearly 50 and I have no love lost for the woke or the asleep, or the right/left, or the republican/democrat.  it is all just a diversion and division tactic if you were to ask me, but this speech is not so much inspiring as it&#39;s a load of bollocks"
I&#39;ve seen this great speech many times. You need to turn the music down. It&#39;s distracting. Thank you.
Unnecessary annoying stupid music. We don’t need to be manipulated. Grow up.
Please leave out the stupied music when you post...annoying and distracting.
This Speak should every Buddy alert that we all fight the same fight about survival.
"This is what intelligence sounds like, for those of you who have never heard the sound before...Listen close, very close and free your mind so that your butt can follow."
A shame about the annoying soundtrack someone decided to put under it. Wtf???
"the gay totally misses the point. To say that someone else is doing wrong does it mean we can do it as well? If others engage in wars all over the world and people will die anyway does it mean we can do it? And more importantly, by putting pressure and fighting for decorbanization, we force investors and scientis to work faster on technological progress."
"Why did you cut the harmless joke, „About 15 months ago my wife got pregnant. Not me, cause we&#39;re old school&quot;, you want people to watch the video but you censor it yourself, that&#39;s pathetic :-)"
&quot;THE SPEECH THAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT&quot; - did it &#39;break the internet&#39;  LMAO
"NUKE  THE  EARTHS CORE AS WE DID IN 45 56? HOPE THIS HELPS  AND 63 CAUSING THE MANTLE TO CRACK ALLOWING THE COLD OCEANS TO COOL THE PLANETSS CORE .WE THEN HAD THE FREEZING WINTERS OF 45 56? AND 63,THIS LATEST TEST FROZE THE SEA AROUND THE UKs COAST. WE THEN HAD A SLOW CLIMB IN CLIMATIC HEAT  PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE PLANETS 23.5 AXIS TILT. Ihope this helps you scientists that do not understand the earths relentless evolution.   Bob."
"&#39;&#39;Smash that Button&#39;&#39; what a powerful statement, so true having been in poverty and raising a child."
"Great video, but I couldn&#39;t focus on the music because that idiot in the background kept talking! Please turn the music volume way up in future videos 🙏"
"it&#39;s called priorities and young people don&#39;t have them....they have ideas of others branded into them, but they will wake up...and when they do....depression, drugs/sex addiction and suicide awaits them because they&#39;ve learned nothing on their own and have been shielded from safe suffering which every child needs to become resilient, strong and successful. The last 2 Gen&#39;s have been destroyed by left insanity posing as virtuous. Sad times."
What a bright person.. Wonderful... All young people should be hearing this ebety month st school👍
"Im 52, and still will never bring a child of my own into this world!<br>Why would i want my child to suffer because of others!?"
"People in western countries dont understand how many tires are burnt in certain countrie every single day going up into your air,and the reason they do it, yup,its because they are poor looking for what WE THE PEOPLE of the planet throw away!!!<br>Not one person is even close to being awake!!!"
So so so sad this only has 2 million views. Soooo sad.
DAMN GOOD SPEECH
Shut the music off. Very distracting.
One the most inspiring and truth filled speeches I&#39;ve heard in my lifetime  !! ❤❤
That was deep..... really DEEP 👏👏👏👏
Liar. Complete and utter obfuscation.
"I sit back and wait to see when the world will waken up and do what they don&#39;t want to do, which is to change! I don&#39;t want to sit back, I want to stand up with the people and change, but I fear I&#39;ll always be in the same position, sitting back, waiting to see when the world will waken up and do what they don&#39;t want to do!"
"The world is at the apex of selfishness. <br>😢😢😢<br>Here in America, people don&#39;t even know how programmed they are to be selfish.<br>i.e.,,,,,<br>Cars almost never give the pedestrian the right of way.<br>In one of the richest counties in the USA. <br>Trump will be re-elected. <br>He is already courting hard line right wing fascists.<br>But I believe that God is allowing this mess until the time that HE will end this. 😢😢😢"
I argue that a third of India do not live in India at all but live in New Zealand
"I appreciate what this man says. I don’t believe in Climate Change and Never Will. For you all who let the music bother you, or think this man doesn’t know what he is doing ~ please rethink and find some common sense!"
Who is this man?
"Powerful speech! I wish if he mentioned something about the starvation &amp; Holocaust in Gaza concentration camp, and the ecocide going on due to the American &amp; European weapon &amp; bombs used."
What a waste if time listening to this man of little knowledge and about growing up
Climate change is a hoax of the US  and European. They destroyed huge acreages of trees everywhere and now want the underdeveloped countries to not do the same as they did
"Brilliant speech, should be compulsory viewing in every Australian university, and on continuous playback in Parliament House"
Good ones
"Please switch off the awful music, I can barely hear what he&#39;s saying."
"The GOD I love, the Creator of our Universe is the only one that can allow this planet to exist without any human interference. He alone will control this universe."
The woke care more about “feelings” more than “the truth.” Lol.
The music is insipid as is this man who knows who he is selling this hogwash to. No facts no knowledge. Low grade sludge fuel used in maritime transportation is one of the huge factors in air pollution for instance.
Common sense.
"Why did you delete his line &quot;Not me, because I&#39;m old school&quot;, referring to his wife&#39;s pregnancy?"
"Great speech, indeed! While I hope deep down that by some miracle it will have an effect on zombies who make up the woke community, all the facts at hand tell me it&#39;s a waste of time... you might as well hold this speech in a forest, with the trees, the effect would be similar... Brilliant man, though."
I can’t understand how such nonsense could appeal to so many people. What he says is a real manipulation of public opinion<br><br>￼
"I actually agree that getting rid of the word &quot;woke&quot; would be just fine, because all of the social and environmental problems would (unfortunately) remain the same, with or without that label.<br><br>In fact, isn&#39;t &quot;woke&quot; actually a word that&#39;s used as an insult, by conservatively orientated people, in order to try to make compassionate qnd open hearted people feel uncertain about trusting the genuineness of their feelings?  Isn&#39;t &quot;woke&quot;, as an insult, a way of attempting to intimidate?  If a person talks about &quot;my facts &#39;versus&#39; your feelings&quot;; to what &quot;facts&quot; do they refer?  Obfuscating, nitpicking &quot;facts&quot;, designed to slow down the genuine need for momentum, when acting upon a genuinely urgent situation?<br><br>I&#39;m writing this comment, after watching the first few minutes of this video, so my comment may not be specifically applicable to this presentation; although I believe that what I&#39;ve written is generally true."
Why would you make the music so loud you can&#39;t hear the speaker?
"Did the Oxford bring in a rebuttal? Otherwise, &quot;Debate Club&quot; really misinforms one in the English language. My wife and I, &quot;Boomers,&quot; never brought children into this world. We <i>adopted</i> two. There, that&#39;s my virtue-signaling bit. One other thing, refuse to allow any person&#39;s actions become the <i>measure</i> of your morals. Therein lies the easy path to sanctimoniousness...<br>Be well."
"Technological advances have saved humans time and time again, but with all technology it can be used for good and evil, hence we Nobel prizes, dynamite used in industrial mining a good thing, in bombs not so good, cars, vans, lorries replaced the horse, put produce emissions"
"Give me a break.  They say that most facts are made up on the spot, and this guy is an example of that.  Out of the 209 countries listed on the world&#39;s Carbon monitoring site Gr. Britain is the 17th highest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world.  <br><br>It&#39;s not about the U.S. and Gr. Britain making a difference by &quot;sinking into the sea,&quot; simply because the main climate change countries, &quot;the poor&quot; as he puts it, are South and Central America.  He says that &quot;they,&quot; the poor countries, are the ones responsible for climate change, and, as he states, &quot;poor people don&#39;t give a shit about climate change.&quot;  The truth is that the very countries he sites as being the most pollutive are actually among the least pollutive.  The further truth is that the people who are the least responsible for the problem are the ones that suffer from it the most.    <br><br>Beyond that, war is the single highest carbon emitter on the planet... it&#39;s ironical then that most of the wars being fought are started by the U.S. and Gr. Britain and are wars for resources in the very countries that he cites as being &quot;the problem.&quot;  The truth is that in a variety of ways, our highly mechanized, gas guzzling societies, and our war-like posture throughout the world, means that the U.S. and Gr. Britain have, more than any other country&#39;s on earth, been responsible for these countries being poor.  It is our colonialistic foreign policies that have been the determinants of these country&#39;s fate.  The U.S. and Gr. Britain could help these countries combat climate change, not only by example, (by doing our part), but also by lifting our oppressive thumbs off of them.  <br><br>The speech that everyone is talking about?  Hardly.  Nobody I know is talking about it... it&#39;s not worth talking about.  In fact, climate change is just one of many of the failing systems within the realm of what&#39;s called &quot;ecological overshoot&quot; (put that into your search engine)-- where many of the earths systems have reached the point of no return and are collapsing to the point to where they can no longer sustain the population.  Climate change is only a small part of this.  <br><br>This guy&#39;s full of shit, and if you believe anything he has to say you&#39;re as easily led as they come.   <br><br>Worldometer worldwide carbon monitoring meter--  <a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-by-country/#google_vignette"">https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-by-country/#google_vignette</a>"
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
What an almost impossibly stupid prat. I bet mummy&#39;s so proud of him !
Thanks!
"This is what the right wing bullshit sounds like.  Sorry, but you are NOT the first who said it JUST LIKE THIS..."
shameless dressing downof kids by a grown man
Brilliant! although I don’t agreed all what he said
Deliver the message without the music!   I switched off.
Is the music necessary?
He taks like a Goebbels… does not espouse necessary morals… he seems to take pride in his negatuvity and screw looking for the correct answer… just deliver his privilege.
perspective and delivery.....both outstanding...
"An amazing example of social engineering at its finest. The truth is we have all the tech needed for zero carbon free electric etc… we have all the tech needed for free unlimited clean water for the entire world and for food. All of that is available but we are not given that. Why? Because the elites don’t want to loose control and can’t accept that they, we, are all the same and the only difference between us and them is knowledge of the truth. Just like now they are trying to associate the people who are waking up and starting  to find out what’s going on as WOKE and that all they do is complain and want to be lazy and live in a sick fantasy world. That’s not true. Waking up and seeing through the deception is the truth and what they do not want"
WOKIES aid the enemies and corrupt ruin their own country to yell and scream to waste and distract everyone from the real problems that are being done to the country.
"You has million kid has no food and city is getting bankrupt <br><br>For Eastern large country please go there and see <br>People have enough food. <br><br>has the technology to build new and clean energy and cheap. <br><br>is doing for the climate change more than the west. <br><br>The west is using other countries made items, to cut out the pollution, so if the west is using the poor countries made, you are part of the pollution"

Brilliant speech
I can end this right now without all the fine words...<br><br>Climate Change is a HOAX to put fear in everyone while the few at the top cash in on OUR misery and stupidity...
Why not have this brilliant speech translated into as many languages as possible- and let it be broadcast  far and wide - all across our world!JaiHind!
Wow this guy explains things where we can understand it. Omg who is this guy never seen him or heard about him before
Well that changed a lot.
Turn down the damn background music.
"it sounds lame, to me..."
Spectacular speech!!!!
FANTASTIC  !
"I want to be mad, I want to be angry.....but I am among the poor of America; I live on $900 a month.  I do NOT want to be this poor but life has worked that out for me spectacularly and I am left at nearly 60yo with no retirement, no 401k, no funeral benefits.  I plan on giving my body away for parts and whatever else they can use of it.  I never have believed in cemetaries or funerals.  Use what you can, cremate the rest and make a pendant out of the leftover.<br>Point is that I have always been a social justice warrior and I wanted to hate this man, and his words BUT I CANNOT DENY HIS TRUTHS.   HE SAYS IT ALL SPECTACULARLY!! <br><br>It is unfortunate that in my country being woke has come to mean things that it isn&#39;t; what is even more unfortunate is that most of those against &quot;woke&quot; cannot even define it nor would they recognize it if they did see it because to them being woke means<br><br>LGBTQI friendly or allied,<br>Books about sex written for teenagers and young adults, <br>The beautiful diversity of our country and our planet,<br>And anything that isn&#39;t identified as evangelical Christian friendly.<br><br>You see these people aren&#39;t Christian anymore; in my country, they are Trumpers or as I like to call them MAGATs because they like to destroy lives and ruin people and then revel in what their hate has wrought.<br><br>Our world has a lot of problems but this gentleman says it quite rightly; the poor do not want to be or remain poor and if we want a world at all then instead of trying to leave it like Elon Musk, we need to work on providing clean ways of operating the systems of social movement."
This was not the end of woke but the begining of the end. Thanks konstinine we owe you.
Why the bloody music.???
Reasonable people know the ans
Salute
Wow
One of the most important speeches ever!
"Because there are many poor people in the world does not mean that we should not go on reminding people about the dangers of climate change. It is the fault of capitalism and communism. Trillions and trillions of dollars (or other currencies) are spent every year to kill people!!! Perhaps if we made better use of that money there would be fewer poor people. I notice that the speaker used communist countries to talk about poor people. There are just as many poor in capitalist countries like say Brazil, or India - and many more in Africa, Central America."
Common sense at last
1 in 10 comments are hateful 9 in 10 niceful 😅
Makes to much sense thats just not cricket 😅
"You cut off and edited some parts, let the whole thing play without omission"
Brilliant speech. Well said mate.👏👏👏👏👏👏
Mediocre and arrogant speech with a supremacy that is deteriorating day by day.
❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mbdp51O0J6Q&amp;t=150"">2:30</a>  Most people - worldwide - suffer from malnutrition - including the middle and upper class - they just don&#39;t realize it"
Great speech. <br>Nothing changes reality more than the application of the old rule: &quot;Put your money where your mouth is&quot;. <br>.

Great presentation.
"Every time you hear the word &#39;woke&#39;, replace it with the word &#39;representation&#39;. That, in essence, is the message.<br><br>Representation inconveniences those with authority and power and the advantageous position many find themselves in. Which is why conservatism is challenged by it (because conservatism is about protecting &#39;the way things are&#39; to those who it suits).<br><br>Dont be considerate; it will worsen your situation. Its a fine argument, but a thoroughly obviously selfish one."
Which British values? Poor people don&#39;t care? We looked at scan photos of wife&#39;s fetus (because he is old shool) and wondered what it would look like at 20months?<br>. Blimey how much does an Oxford education cost? Was it the same grooming and education  given to Frank Kitson when he wrote light insurgency...advocating polluting the waters/communities. Those poor people may need to locate their excrement at your door because of the colonial hole your history dug.
"Poor people in China and South America will not decide how enviornmental policy goes - rather the arrogant self-serving, golden spoon-fed aristocracy - like yourselves - who run the huge companies which are destroying the Earth.

They are not afraid one of the speakers will knock that glass of water straight on that book?
"Yeah, I disagree hard with that speech. &quot;Wokism&quot; isn&#39;t  plain stupidity, just as &quot;Western civilization&quot; isn&quot;t  common sense. Try to dwell in any of both these items and you just find yourself blinded by your own light. Try to take a step further outside of the common box the next time around."
LOL! I loved these burns. This was such a fucking amazing speech
"something about him saying &#39;we would all send plumes of co2 into the atmosphere for the sake of our own children&#39;, watching everyone clap, and realising that statement roughly translates to &#39;humans care more about themselves than the planet to that extreme AND will clap for it&#39;...<br>...sort of sounds like the climate change problem in a nutshell."
"His argument is so fundamentally flawed amd juvenile. It isn&#39;t &quot;poor people&quot; that are profiting from fossil fuel extraction but the fossil fuel companies that have know about climate change since the 1970s, covered up their findings and bribed politicians to continue with the status quo. Fine if you dont care or want to believe in climate change but millions die and suffer from diseases related to the air and water pollution from fossil fuel extraction and processing but I guess that doesn&#39;t matter because it isn&#39;t sudden and in your face to see everyday. China cares about climate change as it now the market leader in solar panels, EV and other green technologies and installing more green energy capacity than any other country, but facts don&#39;t line up with the beliefs you want to hold."
"Should be required viewing for everyone, well said."

"That really is true! woke culture is just a distraction from you being successful and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve realised in my life, everything in this world is a destruction to stop you being successful!<br>work all week, go to the club and waste your money? that was clever!"
yes!
Konstantin keep reminding the people&#39;s that seems fall sleep longer.

"NONE OF THIS MATTERS!  It is the SUN that is causing global climate change, and an Englishman was the first to discover this cycle. Maunder was his name, the the solar cycle which he found is called the &quot;MAUNDER MINIMUM&quot;, the latter for the period of * minimum * solar activity.<br><br>ITS ALL A FRICKING LIE, fossil fuels driving climate change is NOT TRUE."
"I was really beginning to enjoy Konstantin&#39;s speech until he got to the point where he accused the poor who, in his own words, &quot;couldn&#39;t give a shit about serving the planet.&quot; Somehow, you&#39;re right that only 2 percent is yours in UK, but we all live in one world. I wasn&#39;t born yesterday to not notice how the rich countries work. Of course, your backyard&#39;s clean because you&#39;re rich, but where did you throw your trash?<br><br>Where do you think the dirty coal that India still uses came from? Who owns those tons of crates of garbage that was thrown in Philippines? Which country&#39;s depleting Myanmar&#39;s resources and the natives are losing their land and forest right now? And don&#39;t let me even start with Congo&#39;s resources. You point your finger on the poor where their trash lives beside them but new innovations can only be used and savored by the rich."
I really love people who talk without reading from paper or teleprompter and especially if what they say make sense. It is pathetic that 99% politicians can talk only by reading written speeches.
"I feel so woke today, I can smell the coffee."
there is no woke culture no one would call the worst of an idea a culture it&#39;s just the stupid misunderstanding what the idea was the another stupid group misunderstanding everything as they usually does!
&quot;Woke culture&quot; I think he means the &quot;identitarian culture wars&quot; that right wingers started. lol
"thats the problem here! hes completely right... yet he is just talking?! since when did talking solve any problems on this planet? never!<br>actions weight more than words and what actions have been taken? ofc shouting loudly on a street is not an action.... its the same as writing this comment here!<br>you guys voted... you guys voted for the people, who have produced this outcome and now you have to carry the consequences... <br><br>but hey, somewhere in some room, some dude, speaks to other people who already know what he says! looks like for the mayority this was and still is enough!<br><br>not convinced? look at the UK these days :) also this video here has led to the current situation, since it calms people down, hearing what they think and since its 2024 and imagining things is enough and higher priority than reality, you have the UK right now as it is as the consequence... who could have thought, right? XD"
"The UK outsources most of their production, just like most 1st world countries. I assure you that the UK is responsible for more than 2% of carbon emissions. They&#39;re just funding it on different soil. So yes, there is more that could be done. But they won&#39;t because it&#39;s outsourced for the same reason the rich are not going to foot the bill for people working and creating to create CHEAP renewable energy; money. Cost and profit margins are the deciding factor. That&#39;s why we complain, because those of us working and creating will have the ideas, but most of us will never have the money to actually fund these endeavors. The people who do and who will, will do it for profit. And unless many companies with the funds globally come together and decide they&#39;re going to end world hunger, provide clean water, and provide renewable energy, that&#39;s not going to change."
It’s nice to see real men waking up we will get rid of this problem

Magnificent material for my debate class 🙏
"The Origins of “Woke”
<br>The term “woke” originated in African American communities in the United States, particularly within AAVE. It was initially used to describe someone who was aware of and knowledgeable about the systemic injustices faced by marginalized communities, especially people of color. Derived from African American Vernacular English, it emerged as a form of resistance against oppression and inequality.? <br>Disgruntled White Conservative Influences has refined WOKE into a white man&#39;s word, They could not find another word for themselves the dumb asses hahaha"
"With all due respect, this idea of &quot;we&#39;re only responsible for x% of climate change&quot; is a disingenuous practice that speaks of laziness rather than logic."
BS. Total trash definition of woke. He thinks Trump would make better leader of free world! No thank you!
"Excellent, sobering speech. <br><br>Too bad that, as Konstantin said in the very introduction, to WOKE degenerates, feelings are more important than facts, than truth."
Smart talented Traitor lic..ing Western ∆$$es
Everyime he speaks is an absolute delight and breath of fresh air. Incredible.
In his natural habitat haha nah good stuff mate!
"The pole of English politics is also greasy and bloody. Over 200 million humans died of English imperialistic colonialism&#39;s terroristic invasions and subjugations of smaller countries, just for the sake of English empire&#39;s global economic status as #1 in rank."
"It&#39;s funny that this guy is worried about Vladimir Putin as an enemy going to capitalize western cultural values. while completely forgetting that Putin is a westerner who&#39;s already using western system. <br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJdqJu-6ZPo&amp;t=468"">7:48</a> He is right! You&#39;re not going to get those people to stay poor because some of those people prefer to live with simple life rather than extravagant. Otherwise, he&#39;s just projecting his own personal ideal life, which is being financially rich. But that would consequently make him wrong because he&#39;s completely disregarding those people&#39;s preference for way of living. He&#39;s the one who keeps believing that he has no agency by relying on poor people and communist government in formulating his stance on what to do with climate change because he couldn&#39;t even formulate his own individual perspective. (so much for freedom and liberty of thinking) and complaining about woke people by acting like a victim by blaming the current communist China&#39;s government while completely forgetting the fact that communism, which is Karl Marx&#39; ideology that&#39;s western ideology was adapted by China in order to not look like an enemy that would get attacked by Soviet army and simultaneously against the terroristic English imperialists&#39; threats such as the opium war that was perpetrated by barbaric British traders. The fact that this guy is relying on poor people and communist government in terms of forming his stance and using whataboutism in what to do about the climate change... is basically reveals that he couldn&#39;t even formulate his own individual perspective. So much for freedom and liberty of thinking. He also didn&#39;t really argued against the woke people&#39;s notions therefore, he failed. He tried to give the clean energ and cheap argument but completely forgot to mention that the energy is not solely the thing problem but also material garbage pollution that the western countries dominate in global contribution due to the consequent act of non-western government&#39;s defensive precaution against western terroristic imperialists&#39; threats toward those non-western countries and the transnational western trading factories in those countries for the sake of the maintenance of the supply of valuable resources necessary for the survival of English empire&#39;s global economic status as the #1 in rank."
That man is absolutely right. Have any of these WOKE protesters ever developed or invented anything to save or support the environment. Talking is the easy way and doing is the hard way.
"I used to vote liberal but they&#39;ve been taken over by the radical woke ideology, which is just another form of racism and intolerance disguised as some kind of &quot;social justice.&quot; Thank goodness we have these guys exposing them!"

"Climate change is the number one existential issue of our time. For those among us who feel the need to line their pockets or feed their egos off denying this fact, grow a brain cell. &quot;Clever&quot; fools who find humor in making light of this issue should look at the latest WEF appraisal as to the level of threat, which finally acknowledges what the scientists (even in the oil industry) have been saying for decades..."
I have watched this at least a dozen times over the past year. It gives me hope that we still have a voice in the madness

&quot;You&#39;re not going to get these people to stay poor.&quot;<br><br>Come to the US. It seems that people here have degrees in mooching off the welfare system. 😂
"At some point in time in our past, woke people would fill mental institutions. How did this happen?"
"The reason why a lot of poor countries have high amounts carbon emission is beacuse of their population .<br>Countries like India and China habe over a billion people while the UK just has 65 million. <br>The real difference comes in per capita emessions wealther countries and wealthier people do have  higher per capita emissions, not poor people ."
This is like that 13 year old &quot;never talk to the police&quot; video. I like to watch it a few times a year just for fun.
"All woke and dei people can freely go and live in Africa, there they will be able to pay off their “debt”, since they suffer so much from it."

&quot;It will be decided by poor people who DO NOT CARE about saving the planet&quot;<br>&quot;question&quot;<br>&quot;No thank you.&quot;<br>Epic. Don&#39;t take stupid questions when you have a point to make still.
Brilliant 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
"Thank you Mr. Kisin. Well said, Sir ! Not just Putin but WEF, The CCP.  and globalists."
Absolutely spot on!
"It is not a question of being poor, the issue is people who need money to reside paying rent. The system has reverted to possible earnings being standardized to not being enough. Then, you need to ask about China, why they are all so sane, smart, economically fine, not homeless, have culture, pay 2 dollars for clothing, and 10 dollars for phones, 40 dollars for computers, and 1000 dollars for a car."
"woke has become objective reality and now means that you buy the cheapest option versus the brand name, because technology (and AI) has facilitated the quality gap to be bridged. For example lab diamond versus real diamonds, stamped clothing versus the &quot;official&quot; clothing, rebadging items, sticker says Apple 9.0, but is a smart underneath, fly econo versus first class, take a ride-share versus buy a car, etc. on the logic that you are dumb and NOT smart if you pay 20X the price for anything that is a good enough representation of the same product because from the &quot;factory&quot; it cost 4 usd to make regardless of the brand.
<br>Woke is accelerated by technology doing increasing workloads of human jobs, this means no monthly salaries anymore, but freelance fee paid to you for the job, which AI did 80% of anyway, so 5 usd per hour is generous.
<br>Further this affects relationships among humans, where marriage was until death, increasingly it is about the 1 night stand relationship, then move on to the next, and pets (dogs and cats) have gained marriage status, being valued equal to or greater than humans to live under the same roof with.
<br>Social impact is seen, where the male is still expected to earn and pay bills, despite the same being excluded from the corporate hiring practices, relegating a man to hard labor jobs only, and a &quot;threat&quot; in the &quot;office&quot;."

"Im really appreciate the rational speaking of Konstantin, but the point is to give as much more rational  thinking,  BECAUSE  we as people need something consistent. I&#39;m coming from Earth, and believe me, it tried to kill us 100x1000 times, and you are still here is safe if you find some control. Ask some astrophysics how much impact will have some Supernova blows would like millions of years ago if we in the way. We live on this planet by coincidence and luck and you should appreciate every second we are here."
I always come back to this just to show people how woke culture really has devolved hard.

"A filthy traitor is spewing lies about the country his parents were also proud to betray. But hey, when you allow traitors into your so-called establishment it tells everything about you to anyone who wants to know the truth about British."
"One point, I&#39;d argue that Climate Change would be fairly high on XJP priority list. China is a 4000 year old civilization, and XJP doesn&#39;t have to worry about ruling terms and reelection, it&#39;s stewardship of an established civilization, not the building of a new one. There is a fundamental difference in mentality there, which is important to highlight as the speaker illustrates a relatable scenario, using relatable imagery for XJP&#39;s life. <br><br>Sustainability in that context would be an underlying principle, and if one takes a look at China&#39;s adoption of sustainable measures, the reality reinforces this statement."
Like it!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJdqJu-6ZPo&amp;t=454"">7:34</a> precisely my stance on caring for the environment. People come first. Life first. Figure out climate issues in the context living an actual life that doesn&#39;t involve iron age regression"
"Woke culture should not be called like that, It gives false meaning to a term awaken. Same as homophobia, no one is affraid of gays, people mostly hate them, but they don&#39;t fear them. So basically everything about &quot;woke&quot; culture is false starting from the terminology to ithe deology. Should be called &quot;misguided&quot; culture, and  the root to this problem is deep mistrust towards autority. And this distrust snd its roots are s theme  for itself."
"Sir, please help us in America! We are unbelievably tolerant with this madness. Help!! TRUMP 🇺🇸🇺🇸💪🇺🇸🏴‍☠️"
wild west needs you to be the governor
"Not all people from other racial-grouos/cultures are interested in this stupid, nihilistic woke-garbage.<br>Russia, China, South African Nations, South American nations and others, are pushing agaist Western-liberalism.<br><br>Seriously, white-liberals think they know better than everyone else. They are completely delusional and self-righteous.🌏🤡"
Great speech.
"Very good but, he believes climate change is real?!"
"Britain, Australia, Canada, the United States have a duty to retain their identities. And the current demand that they must change, is an extension of the new demand, mandate of compliance, acquiescence, obedience, and submission placed upon us. While recognising and respecting other cultures is important, it is no more critical, and vital than our collective respect, regard, and appreciation of our own identities, our own institutional pillars, and institutions, the values and traditions that have long defined our countries, and societies, and not allow them to be deconstructed, broken down, and dismantled.
<br>
<br>It is not about intolerance, and inequality (favouritism) it is about ensuring our core values remain strong, durable and influential. By doing so we can maintain the integrity of our institutions and the cohesive fabric of our society."
Absolute bs. Says things that can easily be challenged by using actual sources and proof.
"Amazing speech. Put aside the wit and jokes, he was genuine in his promise to try and speak to the &quot;woke&quot; crowd from a position of understanding their feelings, a position of empathy, and a position of shared values of wanting the best for the world albeit from a differing angle."

I tried to leave a comment on his last post yet the people who run u tube wouldn&#39;t let my comment saying 404 server not found so I made a comment saying can&#39;t comment yet that got posted hmmmmmm free speech really we should have free speech when we agree with like this man but not the rubbish going around
what a nerd

"Never heard this word before 5 years ago, never heard anyone say - Sure, Bob can come along, he&#39;s always been woke! It&#39;s a bullshit word! No one used that word until some rightwing internet troll created it and dispersed it. Some young liberals took to it but it really resonates with rightwingers bc it&#39;s a way for them to talk about &quot;gays and blacks&quot; without sounding overtly homophobic or racist. It&#39;s a bullshit word."
super
"Laughter and truth matter. At least Kisin got the laughter right. Homo sapiens are defined by stories, not truth. One story has taken us further than any other. That story has changed our world to the point where &quot;we are in the fight of our lives&quot;. That story is the money story. The problem is not that we have too many left wing nutters or too many right wing nutters or too many &quot;woke&quot; people or too many religious fanatics. The problem is the money story. We need to reconstruct our money story to ensure the survival of Homo sapiens by constructing a story based on Earth&#39;s true currency - air, water, soil, biodiversity and energy. This is a monumental task. It may be that only AI can take us there. We have to recognise that we are an inseparable part of the Earth&#39;s ecosystem. This is the truth that matters more than any other. If Kisin truly cares for his son, he must face this truth now. To all of us, if we truly care for our children and their children and their children and their children, we must face this truth now."

Scott Jennings: Biden Refuted The Entire Thesis Of His Campaign On Friday
So true. Life is not fair get used to it get a hair cut get an education and get a job. Everything comes down to personal responsibility because one day you&#39;re going be standing face to face with God and held responsible whether you like it or not. And that&#39;s why socialists hate God because they don&#39;t want to be held individually responsible.

What a low-life move.  How do these people tolerate one another?   How do people tolerate themself when they know the impact something so tasteless would have?  Sick.
I’ve got a brother like the handicapped man Mr. Kisin met.  He’s a functional quad who can only push with one leg and has spastic control of one arm.  He also has severe short term memory loss.  He can’t eat by mouth and is fed by a tube.  He has a great attitude and is happy.  It is amazing!

Do we really have to lay this all out? Victim hood? Virtue signalling? Are people that lost that they don’t see this blatant over play of emotional thinking?
"So, let me tell you something, I’m blind, I work and study at the same time, and am on the way to finishing my second university degree, which will take time, but will come at one point in the next 18 months. I speak three languages fluently. I’m a certified teacher of English and give lessons in German as well. I’ve never felt I’m a victim. The only thing I feel is disappointment. I’m disappointed that people less qualified than me get 100 times more attention than I. I’m disappointed because the societal models being promoted today are based on victimhood and not on performance or merit. I have migration background, I have a disability, and none of the above has been ever used to take advantage of circumstances. Never in a job interview, for example, have I mentioned that I have these two things. All of the people I’ve talked to have shown the greatest respect for what I am and what I do, and that is a sign that I should not stop, and I won’t. That is for sure."
"I think a lot of the irony in this statement is religious people usually follow the same mindset.  This is my life because this is what god chose for me so I&#39;m just going to ride it out.

"Konstantin exactly specializes on good sounding, but misleading ideas. It is true that people play victims to get attention, but it is also true that people, and kids especially, are oppressed. They feel it, but they can&#39;t explain this properly and incorrectly rationalize this as racism and patriarchy. Just as conservatives incorrectly explain economic depression by immigration. The very fact that people have to pretend they are victims to be at least somewhat successful is exactly showing how broken out society is. There are no other ways for these kids to succeed in our world. Somebody has stolen their future along with their prospects of getting on housing ladder. Did you stole it, Konstantin, with your sweet speeches? Now you come by and essentially say &quot;you&#39;re bad people for playing victims, look at that disabled dude, you should be ashamed&quot;. I don&#39;t think you even understand how devastating and evil your message is. Fix the problem, not the &quot;bad&quot; kids who respond to the problem."

"the last thing that anyone with a disability wants is for anyone to think of them as a victim, shit happened thats life they got on and dealt with it, the vast majority of these so called &quot;victims&quot; these days are just cries for attention and hustles for free handouts"
"Everyone is a victim today. I am a victim, give me money and free stuff."
So well said.
Well that just shits on everybody who has been abused and wronged in some way. Guess these people are abuser enablers?
"KK puts across Israel as victims, and they had no other real option but to kill thousands of women and children.  He is disingenuous and has an agenda, which is that the oppressed and those that are being wronged should put up and shut up, and he extends this to the UK and West.  In the west too, we have corrupt politicians who serve Zionist interests and that of their clique&#39;s above the massess.  Income inequality is at its greatest as is absolute poverty.  Otherwise, we are all in agreement that blaming the other for every single failing as individuals or as society and not taking responsibility makes matters worse."
Victims getting attention tell that to the victims of grooming gangs
We are breeeding psychopathic children ... That they are the most important thing on the planet .....
"The most determination I&#39;ve ever seen in a person comes from people with cerebral palsy. Imagine having a perfectly working brain, but your body just doesn&#39;t want to listen to it and do its own thing."
"Your statement that religion has been a bad thing in human history (your other speech), is fundamentally wrong. In the whole, religion has been a net benefit, as it has engendered morals an ethics in the human diaspora."
"The problem with rewarding, and then debasing, &quot;victimhood&quot;, is that it takes away from actual victims, those who have been systematically repressed due to their disadvantages, whether that&#39;s a disability, their skin colour, their social background, or simply down to the fact they don&#39;t have a voice in the constant clamour that is the woke far left vs the non-existent far right rhetoric.  Thus we end up with an over-privileged, brainwashed majority who think that their imagined struggles and first world problems deserve more attention and remedy than those who are victims of the generational oppression caused by the ancestral power of these privileged classes."
Dark skinned?  Maybe in Sweden.
Most real victims hate to be seen or percived like victims.
Being an oppressed victim is &quot; fun &quot; ?
Konstantin Kisin hombre.
"When you are a victim, nothing can change. It is only when you become an active participant that you can choose your path."
Wow…..what this really screwed up world desperately needs is more people like this amazing fellow Konstantin.
Was raised well by smart parents and went to exceptional schools. Took advantage of that and would like to think I spread it around. Not for me to say...
And right wingers do the same saying the leftists are ruining your world so fight them rather than finding solutions and working with each other.
"There is some truth to the social benefit of the victimhood narrative. But Jordan Peterson has earned fame and fortune telling young people to clean their bedroom and take responsibility for your life. Fortunately, most humans admire heroes (however flawed) not victims."
Jordan Peterson<br><br>Looks different 😂
"I first observed this ~ 15 years when pseudoscience conmen began to garner massive followings on social media. They offered simple, grandiose wrong answers to scientific problems that led their lazy audience to believe that everything they hadn&#39;t be bothered to learn at school was wrong anyway and they were now ahead of actual scientists because they were &#39;open-minded&#39; enough to listen to these charlatans. 15 years later that same formula used by the pseudoscience conmen is now being applied to virtually everything online."
Watch “Sound of Freedom” and see real oppression and real ‘mental health issues.’
"KK is right in principle , but there is a danger of domination of Right wing think which I do not believe is good, A big straw man with the ultra privalged Oxford students, but there are still desperate caualties in our world..  ,People in a deap hole not of thier own making , eg a child from a drug or alcohol dominated familly..  Yes some characters can beat that, at least superfiscially, but we are all of different clay and for many it is not possible ,,We must seek the middle line or ground on this , Victimhood culture widespread is certainly bad, but no victim damaged persons is also a bad way ..  WE should not allow the &quot;winners and losers &quot; to get too far apart ,, That in the long run not good for the &quot; winners&quot; or the &quot; losers &quot; .."
Lgbt ideology etc is more harmful than communism to the human being than the ussr was
Just a beautiful yet tragic sentiment of our contemporary society 😢
It&#39;s easier to fail because your the victim than trying your best and fail.Its always because of your colour or race or gender or ethnicity not because you didn&#39;t make the grade.This turns into a culture that people subconsciously or deliberately make it happen..<br>Kids from low income families and deprived areas are often brought up in homes with unemployed parents living on social handouts.These areas usually have high crime rates and having a criminal record is almost a badge of honour.. the kids are told they will never get a decent job because of where they live and attend a notorious school... with that in mind they don&#39;t care about school and have more emotional connection with the gang they run with than family..... to get the clothes and shoes ( far above the amount parents can afford) they turn to crime which gains them a police record and reduces the chance of a good job...... it&#39;s a never ending cycle that begins with being told thay have no chance of getting on because &quot;THEY WON&#39;T LET YOU&quot; ..... victims of the culture of victimisation.....
All truth can cause discomfort to the lazy thinker.
Ian Dury was very disabled and never ever complained about his situation.  He even had to be carried onto the stage sometimes because if his condition.
Konstantins suit ... 👌
"It&#39;s called positive feedback loop - get a little attention, social media amplifies the attention and now other people will subscribe to the behavior or beliefs that garner attention. Which leads to a wave of people acting in concert with stupidity."
"social validation feedback loop <br><br>As a recovering addict, out of all the drugs I&#39;ve used, or seen the effects of,<br>- the Like button is by far the worst, hands down...<br><br>No other drug has been as detrimental to society as the Social validation feedback Loop has.<br><br>- love to ALL, feel no hate"
I think one of the best speeches I&#39;ve heard!  Thankyou Konstantin.
Did this man just say “I’m dark skinned”??!!😂😂😂 Dudes as white as space ghost.
George So ros is behind most of these dysfunctional social trends.
Oooooooo9oo9ooooooooooo
When truth becomes controversial stupidity is seizing the day.
Thanks Konstantin you are an example to us all especially considering how tough you had it in your impoverished childhood and all😅
"the more attention, the more 💵💵"
I love Konstantin Kisin. He is very bright …..he really seems able to easily see the faults/weaknesses in peoples arguments.  That’s why I don’t get into those debates with people. I can’t come up with a good counter argument until an hour later 😒.  It’s frustrating. Plus I’ve internalized white guilt for years….so I just shut myself up.
"Then why are you Kostya darling allowing your beloved Ukrainian Loyalists ( I&#39;m not gonna say &quot; Nazis &quot; because MI- 6 knows I&#39;ve got Loyalist friends of my own and I love them dearly ) all the victimhood they could ever desire? Why are you peddling the &quot; Ukraine is good, Russia is pure evil &quot; garbage that insults your considerable intelligence and makes you look like a shill- not a brilliant scholar. Why are you doing this?"
I absolutely hate this but I&#39;m with Kostya 120%.
"Sometimes it feels like pulling teeth, but is sanity and common sense finally working its way back into the western world today? We need more and more people like this to come out of the shadows, grab us by the back of the neck and ram our heads into a brick wall to wake us up."
Wow
"I&#39;ve ways found the most disadvantaged people, physically and mentally disabled people, often look at themselves with the least victimhood and have the most drive. <br>Why? Because they have to be to survive. <br>The problem is woke lefties that keep on telling them they are useless and can&#39;t achieve anything by themselves."
Feeling good not the same as Being good.
True hardship builds character.
"We have done young people a great disservice over the past 50 years because we have allowed this victim mentality, and this fantasy world to develop to the point where so many people think that it’s actually real.  We now have young men walking around, thinking that they’re women. We have young actresses going around getting their breasts removed (Ellen Page) so they can look like men. We have millions of black kids who think that slavery happened because of racism. They don’t even know that in the early days of world slavery, people didn’t bring in slaves from other continents. The slaves and the slaveowners were virtually identical people. The first slaves in America were Irish. The ignorance goes on and on, and the reason it goes on and on is because the ignorance is serving a narrative."

Sheeple

"ahahah i said exactly that, A dude or lady, (i forgot) on Subtle Asian Traits was having the second gen immigrant/early adult identity Crisis and my message to that person is essentially that: No one but yourself are the one roadblocking you into how or what you need/want to be. <br><br>Random people replying to my message like: damn you lack empathy, blabla bla. <br><br>So yeah, can relate. this happened literally this week"
"Trigfeenometry stand for free speech, unless you dare ask questions about the holocaust or even interview someone who has questions... Then you must not speak!"
Konstantin always speaks common sense a very articulate and interesting man.
F**k off whiners
Excellently put
Konstantin thinks he has dark skin? Funny. ;)
"I will never ask for your contact info in the comments section, that is someone impersonating me!"
Dudes a wokie. Can&#39;t take criticism of you know what. <br><br>It was funny to watch all these guys fall right in line. Hilarious
The emphasis in ‘freedom’ and ‘individual’ as superior western ideas is so self indulgent and culturally centric.
They will never be happy <br>They don’t consider them selves capeble
Love  Konstantine is right!<br>We created victims is a a diminishing self worth!<br>And deserves to do less<br>It is a positive to work and aspire to!<br>Communism disables. <br>Suffering we can overcome and not be <br>Victims because you have no <br>Aspiration but you have expectations <br>That’s our society has stopped functioning
We have fat homeless people. Poverty is not that.

I remember 20 some years ago I was talking to a university girl and she said she’s a victim because she’s because she’s white and rich and her dad never spent enough time with her because he was a high-powered lawyer so she’s a victim. Boo-hoo.
Dictatorship would be very lonely !

And they are just too unqualified for their positions."
"Woke dogma  is a mixture of Neo Marxism, black supremacism and primacy of perversion in  our culture."
Contains a huge lie from usual Russophobic Hebrew - that Putin without hesitation sent Russians into Ukraine.  That&#39;s a lie - Putin DESPERATELY tried to negotiate peace - entering into FOUR peace deals. ALL rejected by American masters and their Ukranian puppets. That&#39;s a fact.
Wasn&#39;t the &#39;life is suffering&#39; line from Scott Peck?
Our spiritual essence is more foundational than the ego
First off this would not happen if a majority of people would not take part in woke culture... Even the conservatives are woke now days... Sheeple the lot of you! When you have the sinning going on in churches you got... And the greedy that is abundantly present on the red side of things... You get the &quot;woke&quot; culture on the blue side of things... <br><br>This is not rocket science people! You want this to stop... Then stop being so woke! And actually wake up!
&quot;Woke culture&quot; i.e. regular culture is being threatened by MAGA sleep culture.
Pile of crap
I am a victim. Now show me the money..<br>Lots of it!<br>NOW!
Woke was brewed up 30 years ago the #1 intent....destroy America from within
"Chinese collectivism allows for much individualism, same way conservatives are far more tolerant of differences n don&#39;t force on their opinions. The concept embodies ultimately the idea of the cosmological self, cultivated thro society. N philosophical daoism runs parallel in influence to this, and  moves away from societal rules, so internally many chinese do not lock on to rules, they flow w what is given."
"Atheists.<br>The fool has said in his heart there is no GOD.<br>Only a fool would push gender fluidity,which is all the rave in the atheist Marxist democratic socialist community."
Tom talks too much.
Idiots are not taking over the world they&#39;ve already done it.<br>Thing about idiots they don&#39;t see whats around the corner 😂
Ah the talking heads… what is this like two cia tapped celebrities trying to make the world hunky dory?
I feel like most of these trains of thought work for the West with the exception of the West treatment of Africa and Africans globally. I’m actually amazed how much was said while completely avoiding the West brutal relationship with Africa for nearly a millennium.
KONSTANTIN BEST INTERVIEWS!!!!<br>🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️
What a great conversation. Thank You.
"Konstantin is so clear and has so much clarity in his words, he says so much using simple and few words while staying focused on the point. The host on the other hand says so little using complex words in a over drawn out babble of words that rambles on and on to the point of losing focus."
"It beats being taken over by the WEIRD RIGHT CRAZIIES who want to control how you have sex in whom you have sex with, control over women&#39;s bodies, legalize racism, and when it comes to shutting down free speech, they make the wokey left look like amateurs."
The smarter a person gets the more evil he becomes
"Just to be clear about the idea that says that is good is that which works, there&#39;s no moral content to that which works. Pragmatism is a distinctly American philosophy that has some merit; however, if that which works is evil, then that which works cannot be the good. Pragmatism (ism is a suffix for a life and worldview). If an ism is attached an idea, that idea is a philosophical assertion for truth. If something works now will it work at all times? No, it does not. That which works is often temporal and creates other problems exponentially. Pragmatism is abscessed with solving problems but never considers the long term consequence. Does that sound familiar in our government that keeps kicking the can down the road to later solve it when it creates a more serious problem. <br><br>Sorry people but life is going to be difficult and no amount of that which works is going to ultimately solve those problems. That means we are continually responding to problems created a previous problems that created several more problems.<br><br>Now for this super structure idea, that is way over simplified. To have some value are sacred then that value must be eternally true. If a value is only of human preference, it will not ever be an ultimate value. All values must be measured by an ultimate source that has the power to enforce those values ultimately. If there is no consequence ultimately, then all values are temporal and I may pursue my own personal interest and use any means to attain it. If the wicked prosper then wickedness works, right? Then again if there is no ultimate value then good and evil do not exist. That which works has many avenues for that which is good. The good is that which humans say is good."
All of these woke ideas inclusion victimhood feeling good at all costs without actually being good. They all stem from the women being raised to positions of power they will give up the fight for what is right for what is feels good every time. To women the only thing that matters is don&#39;t be mean which means don&#39;t tell the truth don&#39;t look at problems don&#39;t point out anything that&#39;s abnormal. We&#39;re all in this together we&#39;re all love we need to cherish each other&#39;s experience. And none of this absolutely none of it as a position in the hierarchies of our society. These ideas are meant to be at home in our families and carried out into the world and used in the decision processes for doing battle in business or life these are the underlying values that make us human they are not values that you can lead a society success. Running a society with these values will lead to failure and destruction and dominance by others.
"The problem with pseudointellectuals like this guy is that they&#39;re actually much more concern about sounding smart with their righteous-English language but  they ends-up failing because they&#39;re simultaneously ignoring their target enemy&#39;s different perspective and motivation that generates the narrative.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXEnSX_aRRE&amp;t=875"">14:35</a> The problem with that individualist&#39;s &quot;you matter&quot; is the fact that the Christianity&#39;s scapegoatism is still being use by those individualistic people by treating the other &quot;perceived-incompetent&quot; as the &quot;obvious&quot; sacrifice through torturing the target with social condemnation.<br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXEnSX_aRRE&amp;t=128"">2:08</a> The only reason why you feel that &quot;this kind of thing is going to arise at certain times in history&quot; is because of the immature western culture, which is the byproduct of the failure of western civilization to developed sophisticated collective therapeutic spiritual disciplines in the long-term... because of the destructive geopolitical influence of the Dark Ages."
Woke people are not using weaponized empathy because they don&#39;t care about empathy because they&#39;re actually being pretentious concern toward the other people people that they perceived to &quot;deserve better&quot;. It&#39;s narcissistic compassion that is driving their motivation.

watching from Arizona.
question for konstantin: did the suicides of prison guards take place immediately after the death of stalin or after the khrushchev &quot;secret speech&quot; 3 years later? i&#39;ve read solzhenitsyn and he seems unclear on the point.
"Zionism is more dangerous than Nazism because: You cannot distinguish who is a Jew and who is a Zionist. Who is playing offer who is Zionist.<br>They exploit the Holocaust card and the antisemitism card. Christian Zionists claim they are helping Jews. Christian Zionism is an extreme ideology that supports Israel, seeing it as fulfilling biblical prophecy for Jesus&#39;s Second Coming, Armageddon, and the judgment of non-Christians. Jewish Zionists say they are a minority, and the majority of Zionists are Christian. Very few people have the time to understand what Zionism truly is. The power of Zionism lies in its ability to corrupt representatives in Western countries with money, making them support the colonialist state and even banning TikTok from criticizing Israel. Zionists have big control over media, from newspapers to radio, TV, YouTube, and Facebook. Israeli Zionists kill and attack any place in the West and then retreat to Israel. Zionists can ruin your career almost anywhere in the West by labeling you as antisemitic."
Really good episode. Thank you
We are seeing the cons of democracy. It great but once fools take charge counties and empires fall

It was way better by the time he was old enough to be a Big Brother.<br>Pretty much everybody from major urban areas has never seen real economic poverty or poor people

"There needs to be equality of opportunity. However, the issue is that the idea of a meritocracy is being abandoned in favour of social engineering. A DEI actor doesn&#39;t necessarily have talent or charisma. An all female cast is not a recipe for on-screen magic. An all-black games studio is not guaranteed to produce good games. Individual aspects like talent, imagination and charisma are crucial as well as the personal will to hone skills and gain experience over many years. This is all being cast aside in the name of forced equality. This tide must be turned before it ruins us. The western entertainment industry is probably beyond saving now but the rot is spreading. Do you want a heart surgeon that knows what they are doing or are you happy with a diversity hire? There is already talk of hiring airline pilots on the basis of diversity quotas......"

"I know this will be an unpopular comment and will get me mocked but...<br><br>When talking about covid and its said that it wasn&#39;t that spreadable, it wasn&#39;t a big deal, it was about authoritarian behaviour etc, this is a poor take in my opinion.<br><br>My wife and I observed the rules. We stayed in. We didn&#39;t mingle. We got through about 1.5 years covid free. We then went out to london one night. Our first night actually going somewhere congested with no mask or anything. We travelled by train on the saturday and travelled home on sunday. On Monday we both had covid. Not one of us, it was both of us. That is a spreadable disease/illness/sickness or whatever. We don&#39;t know how we got it. Was it from a person? The hotel we stayed in? Something we touched? Impossible to know. Now of course you may argue the effect of covid. For a few days we felt terrible. Could&#39;t sleep, eat etc. But we got over it, we didn&#39;t die. However, when it first happened in the world people were, supposedly, dying. So you take the fact that yeah, something spreads via all sorts of unknown means and it can potentially kill you. What do you do?<br><br>If you own a shop and there is an issue with a gas leak, you know its going to have a terrible effect on people exposed. You might die, you might not. But you know its there and you need to make sure your people are safe. Do you send them home to keep them safe and away from danger until the issue is resolved or do you make them go home and be safe while you fix it? the former is the obvious choice even if you are responsible for only 2-3 people. Government is responsible for protecting millions and billions.<br><br>At the time I feel the governments, who we like to say are responsible for our safety (thats not deniable, we expect government to serve us and ensure we get what we need to survive and uphold how we expect our country to be maintained) made the sensible choice. It was a difficult time where none of us would know what to do. Its fine to look back and say &quot;i would have done this&quot; but would you? When you are in it, its a different matter and most of us do not know the feeling or pressure of being responsible for billions of people."
So many times KK starts interviewing Tom 😆 great video!
I LOVED this conversation!
"Funny how Tom thinks he has seen poverty up close.. and proceeds to describes a home, refrigerator and air conditioning but bad neighborhood 😆 cracks me up. This is definitely the description of poverty in the USA. For most parts of the world this description is an upper middle class. I was born and raised by a single mom in a room that was our bedroom, kitchen, living room &amp; bathroom with no refrigerator or AC. Anyways... whatever your definition of poverty is, the truth is WE CAN ALL GET OUT OF IT, BETTER OURSELVES &amp; CONTRIBUTE TO THE WORLD . ✌️♥️<br>Thank you TOM for sharing this with us."
It all boils down to wealth inequality and corruption. People just don&#39;t know what to point their fingers at.
"The best analogy I have seen: many progressives have Munchausen’s syndrome, or Munchausen’s by proxy. America is like the child who was being poisoned by her mother in the movie Sixth Sense. The mother gets addicted to the attention and sympathy she gets for seeming to be a “caring” figure. So addicted that she ignores the fact that she is hurting the child, killing her ultimately. The poison is wokeism and DEI. It has not proven to be effective; if anything it’s been proven to be the opposite, destructive even. The mother is all the progressives, academics, and people who are addicted to the attention, sympathy, and other benefits (academic, professional, social, and otherwise) that they get for either claiming to be oppressed, or advocating for others who fit that description. They have total disregard for the consequences; in fact they have, through cancel culture, shut down any discussion, much less debate. People respond to incentives; it’s almost understandable in that context. But given the hysteria, and the destructiveness to our society, it’s time to push back."
I&#39;m a Christian and a recently graduated chaplain from college. This forum needs to be heard in the faith based community
"&#39;men need sex to feel loved and women need love to have sex&#39;<br>I imagine men don&#39;t feel loved since becoming the boon of western society jokes, hence porn addictions?"
All men are created equal does not equate to every human having divinity. That is a twisting of the Christian teaching that all men are created in the image of God which does not equal divinity.<br> That is an old Christian heresy from the time of the early Christian church. It is because the US stopped being protestant but kept parts of the teaching which allowed it to come back as neo-gnosticism.
"I just realized how different the rest of the west is from the USA in relation to the <a href=""http://left.in/"">left.In</a> most other western countries the real left is low income workers with a few highly educated members and some college students.The bulk of it is mostly working class that struggles everyday.And the workers certainly ain&#39;t <a href=""http://woke.so/"">woke.So</a> their main reason for being left is entirely different than the USA.Anyways, watched hundreds of hours of JP,Murray,Haris etc etc,and ll of em have character flaws.But Kisin....I cant find any faults to his character,he has become my favorite very fast."
"IF TOM SOWELL IS SO LEGIT THEN GET HIM ON YOUR SHOW. HE&#39;s 93!!! Cummon guys, stop ducking him. How many times has Kneel Tyson been on Rogan? TOM SOWELL HASN&#39;T BEEN ON ROGAN ONCE!!! Get Tom Sowell on your show!"
Look how many lawsuits the left have against Donald Trump an ex President who is running against the current administration for election. This is unprecedented election interference and persecution of a political opponent.
and that is why i reject most christians. they wont or cant be soldiers or warriors ..unlike the evil islamics ..i suggested merging the two cults but it didnt get any traction.
and if you know its my coffin and Gay the Devil put a hell programme into the sphere that runs it you know why evil [God] is so much stronger than any number of good men...what then? you are right being moral is good. but under HIM it makes you food.  the only possible recourse is battle.
yes the pendulum is wildly unbalanced.  Gay always chose Tragedy but i chose Comedy. now he is beaten but the CIA is determined to make me crash. so i think we will wind up with a really off the wall surreal kafka or dostoevski.
Sensitivity is the millennials drug
"Kisin has hit the nail on the head about what differentiates the west from all other cultures - individualism / individual liberty / individual freedom. It has taken the west quite far. But I think this idea is running on fumes now.<br><br>The better system is to have individual rights AND duties. Rights without duties will lead to anarchy. <br><br>And the reason why such anarchy is only rearing its head in the west now is because, for the past 100 years, people inherently understood the importance of taking responsibilities, even though no one was shoving on them. But now, people have forgotten the importance of taking responsibilities along with the rights given to them by their society."
Incredible guest! He and Jordan Peterson have been thee best so far!
It is weaponized!
"Tom, if life is simply an accident of chemical reactions then by definition there is nothing &quot;sacred&quot; about life. You can&#39;t have it both ways."
Konstantin talks about Russians fighting wars for the monarchy. Who the hell does he think the American military is fighting war after war after war for? These are clearly imperialist wars fought by the poor for the rich. Konstantin might be an expert on Russia but he&#39;s got a lot to learn about the west.
Social media needs to go
"The way to deal with woke people is to refuse to converse with them on their terms, just tell them you will only talk on your terms, then you control the situation and no one needs to be offended by anything said, if the other person refuses this, just politely excuse yourself from their company."
The error is in assuming theyre bright minds because they go to Oxford lol. they are the most brainwashed that i would agree
It all starts at school you brainwash them when they are young and naive because they will believe anything you tell them it’s called indoctrination wake up
I love Konstantin.
"That woman who keeps shouting at the panel should have been removed has no manners at all, she is route."
Year later its got alot worse
The youngs are worth an effort
"Communism was exported to Russia by ex leaseholders,now the West is trying again."
"what I loathe the most is that the woke call people racist or nazis very quickly, which is a very harsh insult. but somehow that&#39;s ok."
I bet he gives a toss about poor people in Asian countries. This guy must have connections with the oil industry.
If he can be called a &quot;satirical comedian&quot; wtf is that bloated gasbag across from him?
How can someone speak English like that when it&#39;s his second language?
"How have we got to this place?, a great question"
Wt bloody f was that <b>bing</b>
"I am a big fan of this guy but the &quot;only 2% Co²&quot; argument is bogus , Why ? Because if advanced nations show you can prosper without burning much carbon fuel, and can also prove it is a superior econömy in cost , which many believe to be the case, then that is the goal.. ,As a successful example.. Too many can only immagine the change to renewables as be a loss situation and that is not reasonable, that is not the case, .. Not te mention national security of energy independence ."
"Young people, ask yourself why leaders would listen to a young girl, Greta that hasn&#39;t live long enough to know what size bra she needs to buy??  Please consider that the elite are wanting to eliminate many poeple by taking away low cost  energry.  But the Elite will not volunteer to give themselves as a sacrifice for global warming!!"
Woke = Fascist
Used your voice your talent so that people&#39;s  knew the truth .
Arrest Soros
Why do you have to be reasonable with people that are the most unreasonable the world has ever seen?
Highly INTELLIGENT Mr. So DAMN true !!!!
"An old army mate of mine who did two tours of Malaya and two of Vietnam (including with the AATTV) experienced a severe PTSD episode at a cinema during the ambush scene in Forrest Gump, which required him receiving assistance to leave the cinema. Then you get complete farquewits like these two, who&#39;ve led soft-arsed privileged existences, preaching to everybody else about what they shouldn&#39;t be triggered by. Go farque yourselves with a shared carrot, you small-minded wankers."
Uh...capacity
"Konstantin is sooooo right, on every aspect he considers. Thruthfull honest thinking capaity. Brilliant analyzer. No ego-lead person. Just in search of the truth and coming up with real solutions. Independent thinker."
Rich men discusing partial segism in society so they can get the attention of women on socal media.Setting unrealistic expectations to women
"If you can&#39;t take a comedic fact, you will definitely not swallow a straight-up fact down your throat."
Next thing you know NASA comes out and says there&#39;s evidence that beings lived on Venus but they created their own global warming and therefore that&#39;s why Venus is as deadly and inhospitable today lol.
"You do not have to defeat the woke people  just ignore them, Stupidity always disappears over time so no problem."
"Its not the woke mentality alone, it is the right&#39;s inhibiting the very progress he apparently champions. Perhaps he&#39;s too young to remember  Jimmy Carter and putting the symbolic solar panels on the roof of the white house. Symbolizing the need for progress, the very progress Kisin  proclaims in this speech, was undermined by the Reagan Administration who as his first act in office was to remove this very symbol of progress now we are 40 years behind and then to defund the departments that worked to enhance clean energy. Don&#39;t blame wokism nor the poverty in South America and Asia, blame the right leaners for destroying progress which put the US 40 years behind the 8 Ball. While wokism has its issues the right is the true cancel culture of alternate energy. They weren&#39;t around during the failed Reagan administration."
That selfie sealed it 🤦‍♂️ Konstatin is a right GRIFTER! Piers left ITV on his own …. What a pair of Karens! Woke and Anti-woke are profiteering off stupid views!
A Brit and a Russian defending America.  That’s how f’ed up we are.
So woke people don&#39;t work...of course not...only you works! LOL
"The generations that complained non stop about gay people, about other religions, about single mothers, about pretty much everything now SURPRISE SURPRISE complains about the younger generations LOL"
If you externalize your emitssons to poor people countries then it is easy to say you are not responsible for the emissions I guess.
Stopping the climate-change...<br>which MAMA EARTH is creating...?!!!<br>Good luck with that.<br><br>I tell you TRULY :<br>The homosapien-society must change into...🪞🪞🪞<br>HUMANITY-PEACEFULLY.<br><br>YIS-YA 🙏❤️✌️💎👌🌍☝️
He&#39;s a bright man
The problem is the Woke don’t understand that they have corrupted their own brains. They don’t even see themselves as Woke and try to dismiss being called woke by saying it’s old and stupid. Just call them Neo-Woke that got corrupted from their original goals of working towards a common good for the oppressed and under represented  to hateful fascist racist for their own power.
The nice thing about this is that it gives you the hope that maybe the world won&#39;t turn into an insanely perverted place because of the woke.  It&#39;s terrifying.
"Question: why do we not offer to send (these so-called woke people), them to a country that better represent what the want, and offer that country (China, Russia and any other socialist and fascist country) a swap, we will take the ones who want to live in a democratic and free country."
this is the nest thing I&#39;ve heard in ages...!
"Ehhhh, wait a minute, you shouted down Tommy Robinson when he talked about the Qu&#39;ran, you didn&#39;t want to hear what he had to say, you just yelled at him Piers..."
Aware of political and social injustices...especially racism!<br>Finish the definition Piers!
Konstantin Kisin if you see this i think you are great!
Wokery jokery needs a boot pokery.
$70 a month just to read their content is a bit rich!  Trig are making a bloody fortune on the back of their anti Wokeness.  A bit like Meta I guess.
‘Basically are a form of fascist😂😂’
"if we abide by extreme left wing views and policies along with extreme right wing views we are in trouble - AND YES you left wing followers you are as bad as the right wing ,,,PS sorry piers you believe in god - religion is another extreme we could do with out"
It was a brilliant speech but the bone he threw them is based on a lie
Quite bigoted to the like of Piers and Kisin himself to abuse &#39;woke&#39; people. Do they even exist? Can someone seriously say that they subscribe to the &#39;woke&#39; mentality? Projection.
A brilliant speech by any standards. Thanks Konstantin.
great speech
I question climate change. Car&#39;s get the blame and hammer for climate change however very little is said of planes. Holiday makers around the world including cruising gets a free pass
"Thank You Piers Morgan for once again proving that your Channel is the place of safety, normality and comfort for the number of ordinary people that suddenly in todays world hsve been left outside and dont have many other spaces or just a home like this one-the home of freedom and logic in general factual thinking and intelligent and kind but powerful discussions.<br>So important today-in this overwhelming run of information and completely subjective, repeatedly blind against the ones of others and often aggressive and totally new or baseless narratives from multiple sides.<br><br>Thank You Mr. Piers Morgan and Mr. Konstantin ❤️👏💡<br>We all feel good being able to listen to such smart and educated adults but also and first of all just the non populistic and reflecting the common sense people 👍"
"i used to do drugs.  i still do, i just used to, too!"
As someone from eastern europe who also dealt with communism until a few 3 decades ago this is what the western world doesnt realize.<br><br>They dont realizes how dangerous this insane censorship can get because these idiots dont actually know what it means to actually live under an opressive government.<br><br>These phucken losers believe being mosgendered is opression for example
"The main thing is to save  energy! Ever thought of that? ?  Begin with private air condition at home, or in cars. Move your asses, instead of takin the car. Etc.."
"The idea that we are ruining the world is an old one.  Even the Bible in Revelations, God said he would destroy those &quot;ruining the Earth&quot;.  The problem is the way the &quot;woke&quot; crowd decides to do it.  The fact is that they don&#39;t have real power to enact change, they have no actual vote.  They can pressure companies to go along for a short time, but those companies will never change the fundamental core of how they pollute just to please this generations loud hippies.<br><br>  Of course if the world doesn&#39;t act, they can&#39;t complain if God does return to save us from ourselves, right when we are about to go extinct for not stopping the global damage to the planet.  I&#39;m not sure if it will happen in my lifetime, but so far the world is getting worse, more pollution can not be a good thing.  The Earth is finite and it can&#39;t take an infinite amount of abuse without there being consequences."
Loved his speech when I saw the whole of it. Another great interview Piers.
People don&#39;t ever acknowledge how perceptive a comedian has to be to create a routine.
Piers is still kind of an ass though … Declaring where Konstantin is going to film HIS OWN show.
"My name is Mahyar Radmehr, charged in August 2023 and facing 5 years in prison in Canada for having created a website exposing a female serial accuser by the name Sheida Khosroshahi with legally obtained documents who has charged and displaced men since 1997..Run the name sheida khosroshahi on Google  and see for yourself."
"Also, the Internet doesn&#39;t help by spreading this type of nonsense."
"Compare the brilliance of his speech in its entirety, with the several hundred televised versions of Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion word salad offerings - as nutritious as a can of spam or a box of kraft dinner. <br>Konstantin Kisin is a remarkable example of a true and powerful cultural diversity, the kind that made the west through most of the 20th century such a cornucopia of freedom of thought. <br>Great discussion, guys. Only wish it had extended longer. Needs another round or two."
It’s an amazing reality that the best comedy is the ridiculous Truth.  That’s why liberals fear memes.
"Piers Morgan always complains about the woke culture, yet he went super woke with Tommy Robinson about Islam. I have never heard him criticize how the woke culture empowering Islamic terrorism, not only towards the West, but towards Muslims and former Muslims who are part of the Islamic world even if they left it and are still a persecuted minority. Even in the UK by their Muslim families. Piers Morgan is either afraid of Muslims or he is a hypocrite"
"The problem with these types of free speech idiots is they take no personal responsibility for what they say. Most are really dumb, wokeness is about the equality of all, including speech, thought, expression and existence. It is not about cancelling, unlike these numbskulls advocating a few grifting words."
"The &#39;cleanest&#39; energy source ever devised is that derived from fossil fuels. It&#39;s staggering how brainwashed we&#39;ve become, demonizing carbon, carbon! the constituent element of all life on Earth! And to achieve the asinine goal of &#39;net zero&#39;  carbon emissions we&#39;ll chop down ALL trees, severely reduce arable land devoted to agriculture, relocate rural populations to  cities ... It&#39;s astonishing how destructive such plans are to Earth&#39;s environment, and it&#39;s being done deliberately."
"The first thing you have to do, is recognise your enemy.  WHO, is not only responsible for introducing it, BUT, who is feeding this sickness? And take it from there."
"Republicans criticize their own side a lot! Too much! As Rush used to say, “Democrats circle the wagons and Republicans shoot their wounded.”"
It will be interesting when these people get into the work place and start running for politics and change try to laws to meet their beliefs and realize it is not that easy.
We will absolute defeat wokeness.
"It&#39;s a cultural revolution, Maoism with western elements."
"people who dont believe in their selves ,ussualy go for some woke group of people to feel better ,but they cant see that theyre just brainwashed and lost ,my message love youre self and believe in yourself and you will look alot better in others eyes ,dont sell your soul to self loving people who wants world to bend"
Now after all that What are they going to do in the meantime  how many years will it take  all countries  will have to  be together about this A real challenge
Brilliant makes sense really impressed
"Wokeness, hopefully will be all gone within 4-5 years."
"If you go woke you go broke and stupid, not logical thinking, not an individual thinking is just have one learn speach that you repeat all over with no  opinion of your own cuz this is not your idea is a bad route that make you belive you are a victim and that you have to love just like that amd not try to be better just cry over all and mekw the rest equally stupid to follow. No thanks i like my brain and critical thinking."
The West is becoming far left. The communist Bolsheviks are in power. <br><br>Unless their is a reincarnation of Adolf Hitler it&#39;s going to get worse
🎉Thank You!!! YES!! Post Woke!! YES!! Pretty Stupid!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏🤩
Can’t wait for that collaboration between the two of you 🙌🙌🙌
Human gas is loaded with greenhouse gases.  For God’s sake….STOP FARTING!!!
The woke mob are communists/ Marxists. Plain and simple.
Konstantin is fighting against the woke culture and therefore he deserves everyone&#39;s supports for that matter.
He is saying Latin America and Asia are responsible for environmental issue. Hope this idiot gets some history lesson with fact. Your so-called west manufacturing is done in Asia and Latin America.
Woke will destroy itself. Fanatics always do. Just a question of how many they take down with them...
He the of the bat that poor people couldn&#39;t give a f about saving the planet. The audacity.
"keen insights, robust arguments and irrefutable logic"
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
guy looks like the anoerexic vladimir klitschko
Great debate!
"Morgan is crying woke because people like him no longer have absolute monopoly of the media like before.<br>People now can freely express their own view on social media and be heard unlike when the MSM had absolute power to control people’s mind.<br>He’s not used to being challenged or opposed to, opposing his views easily translates to being CANCELLED.<br>Megan merkel issue and the Ukrainian-Russian war is an example of that."
"There&#39;s such a Sinister feeling to it all. And I always wondered who funds these people where do they get their money? Someone has to pay for transportation, t-shirts signs bull horns. Follow the money who funds them? I&#39;d love to know <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voMaVTqL1OQ&amp;t=367"">6:07</a>"
"More and more everyday, all those rumors I heard about a new world order seem to be materializing right before my eyes. It is so obvious that the self-appointed ruling class leftist activist and they&#39;re poor victimized voters that have been lied to for decades. Thanks for speaking out you&#39;re a wonderful sensible man. You&#39;re okay to pierce wink <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voMaVTqL1OQ&amp;t=278"">4:38</a>"
"I noticed this was posted 4 months ago. Is this wonderful man still around? Or have the leftist destroyed him yet😢 <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voMaVTqL1OQ&amp;t=94"">1:34</a>"
I support the speakers on educating youth rather than demonizing them. Woke culture has done nothing but harm. I do disaree with the comment on carbon footprint though. The reason why Asia and South America are responsible for high carbon emission is because North America and Europe has shifted majority of their production to these countries for reduced cost.
He seems woke to me an activist discussing a practical solution to climate change
"Republicans want to control where you shop, where you eat, what you can buy, what to think and who you can make live to. It is 1930’s Germany."
You can’t defeat something if you don’t even know what it is or should even be defeated.
"I&#39;m not woke, but I&#39;m a leftist. And he&#39;s spitting bullshit that only morons would actually take for facts. First of all, making changes to the way we consume is what would bring positive climate change, the west is the biggest consumer of Chinese products. So the West is indeed responsible for China being the biggest polluter in the world. And if the West had any good intentions, they would boycott products that are not responsibly produced. And that would actually make China prosper even more as they can start selling these products at higher margins. These studies that show the biggest polluters in the world don&#39;t take into account when a country contributes to another countries pollution. For example, the biggest consumer of Chinese products is the US. Therefore, the US should be considered the biggest polluter and not China."
"Thank You So Much For Watching And STAAAY BLESSED :)<br>If You are interested in my book full of short stories it is available now !<br><a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPQYT3WH"">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPQYT3WH</a><br><a href=""https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0BPQYT3WH"">https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0BPQYT3WH</a>"
"We in the UK have ABSOLUTE MORAL OBLIGATION TO LEAD SUSTAINABILITY /GREEN REVOLUTION. BRITAIN STARTED INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, HAS APPROPRIATED MUCH MORE THAN MOST COUNTRIES OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES THAN MOST COUNTRIES SINCE THEN, DESTROYED MUCH MORE TOO, AND IS WASTING ITS POTENTIAL ON CREATING BXXSHIT ECONOMY, VIRTUAL ECONOMY, ON MINDLESS CONSUMERISM."
"My theory is they tell us it&#39;s hotter, we think its hotter, and so it gets hotter.<br><br>We are programmed to manifest these temperatures. We create those temperatures with our thoughts."
How is climate change &quot;woke culture&quot;????
"Fuck the planet! (GB is 2% of TODAYS emissions, amazing how he forgets how they got RICH."
That&#39;s why wizards that will figure out how to make clean energy cheaply are greater than the prophets that prescribe inefficient protesting.
most important speech in the last 6 months ever!
"This should be shown to the New Zealand government.  And ex Prime minister Jacinda Ardern.  She tried to be St Greta of Thundaberg greatest campaigner, companion. Stupid b#$ch. So many people lost jobs , and they imported crap stuff from overseas cos it was cheaper."
This guy knocks it right out of the park… Superbly spoken….
The music is disturbing.
"Laughter and truth matter. At least Kisin got the laughter right. Homo sapiens are defined by stories, not truth. One story has taken us further than any other. That story has changed our world to the point where &quot;we are in the fight of our lives&quot;. That story is the money story. The problem is not that we have too many left wing nutters or too many right wing nutters or too many &quot;woke&quot; people or too many religious fanatics. The problem is the money story. We need to reconstruct our money story to ensure the survival of Homo sapiens by constructing a story based on Earth&#39;s true currency - air, water, soil, biodiversity and energy. This is a monumental task. It may be that only AI can take us there. We have to recognise that we are an inseparable part of the Earth&#39;s ecosystem. This is the truth that matters more than any other. If Kisin truly cares for his son, he must face this truth now. To all of us, if we truly care for our children and their children and their children and their children, we must face this truth now."
Konstantin is one of the great men
It’s Sherlock!
"At the 4 minute mark, why did you edit the speech.  In his actual speech, after he said that “about 15 months ago my wife got pregnant”, he followed that with a comical line that she got pregnant, not him, because they are old fashioned.  What’s wrong with that statement?  People in the hall laughed, I did too.  It’s strange that someone edited the line out."
"so if I am going to distill his argument down, it would read something like, fix poverty through technology and that will do a lot to curbing the advance of what he perceives as the negative effects of climate change?  Am I hearing him right and not getting myself all confused?  great....then he better hope that technology helps us skip the step where the poor of china and India get cheap cars....In the extraordinarily short history of the human race when have technological breakthroughs EVER been either CLEAN or CHEAP?   This is a load of bollocks.  I am nearly 50 and I have no love lost for the woke or the asleep, or the right/left, or the republican/democrat.  it is all just a diversion and division tactic if you were to ask me, but this speech is not so much inspiring as it&#39;s a load of bollocks"
I&#39;ve seen this great speech many times. You need to turn the music down. It&#39;s distracting. Thank you.
Unnecessary annoying stupid music. We don’t need to be manipulated. Grow up.
Please leave out the stupied music when you post...annoying and distracting.
This Speak should every Buddy alert that we all fight the same fight about survival.
"This is what intelligence sounds like, for those of you who have never heard the sound before...Listen close, very close and free your mind so that your butt can follow."
A shame about the annoying soundtrack someone decided to put under it. Wtf???
"the gay totally misses the point. To say that someone else is doing wrong does it mean we can do it as well? If others engage in wars all over the world and people will die anyway does it mean we can do it? And more importantly, by putting pressure and fighting for decorbanization, we force investors and scientis to work faster on technological progress."
"Why did you cut the harmless joke, „About 15 months ago my wife got pregnant. Not me, cause we&#39;re old school&quot;, you want people to watch the video but you censor it yourself, that&#39;s pathetic :-)"
&quot;THE SPEECH THAT EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT&quot; - did it &#39;break the internet&#39;  LMAO
"NUKE  THE  EARTHS CORE AS WE DID IN 45 56? HOPE THIS HELPS  AND 63 CAUSING THE MANTLE TO CRACK ALLOWING THE COLD OCEANS TO COOL THE PLANETSS CORE .WE THEN HAD THE FREEZING WINTERS OF 45 56? AND 63,THIS LATEST TEST FROZE THE SEA AROUND THE UKs COAST. WE THEN HAD A SLOW CLIMB IN CLIMATIC HEAT  PROBABLY CAUSED BY THE PLANETS 23.5 AXIS TILT. Ihope this helps you scientists that do not understand the earths relentless evolution.   Bob."
"&#39;&#39;Smash that Button&#39;&#39; what a powerful statement, so true having been in poverty and raising a child."
"Great video, but I couldn&#39;t focus on the music because that idiot in the background kept talking! Please turn the music volume way up in future videos 🙏"
"it&#39;s called priorities and young people don&#39;t have them....they have ideas of others branded into them, but they will wake up...and when they do....depression, drugs/sex addiction and suicide awaits them because they&#39;ve learned nothing on their own and have been shielded from safe suffering which every child needs to become resilient, strong and successful. The last 2 Gen&#39;s have been destroyed by left insanity posing as virtuous. Sad times."
What a bright person.. Wonderful... All young people should be hearing this ebety month st school👍
"Im 52, and still will never bring a child of my own into this world!<br>Why would i want my child to suffer because of others!?"
"People in western countries dont understand how many tires are burnt in certain countrie every single day going up into your air,and the reason they do it, yup,its because they are poor looking for what WE THE PEOPLE of the planet throw away!!!<br>Not one person is even close to being awake!!!"
So so so sad this only has 2 million views. Soooo sad.
DAMN GOOD SPEECH
Shut the music off. Very distracting.
One the most inspiring and truth filled speeches I&#39;ve heard in my lifetime  !! ❤❤
That was deep..... really DEEP 👏👏👏👏
Liar. Complete and utter obfuscation.
"I sit back and wait to see when the world will waken up and do what they don&#39;t want to do, which is to change! I don&#39;t want to sit back, I want to stand up with the people and change, but I fear I&#39;ll always be in the same position, sitting back, waiting to see when the world will waken up and do what they don&#39;t want to do!"
"The world is at the apex of selfishness. <br>😢😢😢<br>Here in America, people don&#39;t even know how programmed they are to be selfish.<br>i.e.,,,,,<br>Cars almost never give the pedestrian the right of way.<br>In one of the richest counties in the USA. <br>Trump will be re-elected. <br>He is already courting hard line right wing fascists.<br>But I believe that God is allowing this mess until the time that HE will end this. 😢😢😢"
I argue that a third of India do not live in India at all but live in New Zealand
"I appreciate what this man says. I don’t believe in Climate Change and Never Will. For you all who let the music bother you, or think this man doesn’t know what he is doing ~ please rethink and find some common sense!"
Who is this man?
"Powerful speech! I wish if he mentioned something about the starvation &amp; Holocaust in Gaza concentration camp, and the ecocide going on due to the American &amp; European weapon &amp; bombs used."
What a waste if time listening to this man of little knowledge and about growing up
Climate change is a hoax of the US  and European. They destroyed huge acreages of trees everywhere and now want the underdeveloped countries to not do the same as they did
"Brilliant speech, should be compulsory viewing in every Australian university, and on continuous playback in Parliament House"
Good ones
"Please switch off the awful music, I can barely hear what he&#39;s saying."
"The GOD I love, the Creator of our Universe is the only one that can allow this planet to exist without any human interference. He alone will control this universe."
The woke care more about “feelings” more than “the truth.” Lol.
The music is insipid as is this man who knows who he is selling this hogwash to. No facts no knowledge. Low grade sludge fuel used in maritime transportation is one of the huge factors in air pollution for instance.
Common sense.
"Why did you delete his line &quot;Not me, because I&#39;m old school&quot;, referring to his wife&#39;s pregnancy?"
"Great speech, indeed! While I hope deep down that by some miracle it will have an effect on zombies who make up the woke community, all the facts at hand tell me it&#39;s a waste of time... you might as well hold this speech in a forest, with the trees, the effect would be similar... Brilliant man, though."
I can’t understand how such nonsense could appeal to so many people. What he says is a real manipulation of public opinion<br><br>￼
"I actually agree that getting rid of the word &quot;woke&quot; would be just fine, because all of the social and environmental problems would (unfortunately) remain the same, with or without that label.<br><br>In fact, isn&#39;t &quot;woke&quot; actually a word that&#39;s used as an insult, by conservatively orientated people, in order to try to make compassionate qnd open hearted people feel uncertain about trusting the genuineness of their feelings?  Isn&#39;t &quot;woke&quot;, as an insult, a way of attempting to intimidate?  If a person talks about &quot;my facts &#39;versus&#39; your feelings&quot;; to what &quot;facts&quot; do they refer?  Obfuscating, nitpicking &quot;facts&quot;, designed to slow down the genuine need for momentum, when acting upon a genuinely urgent situation?<br><br>I&#39;m writing this comment, after watching the first few minutes of this video, so my comment may not be specifically applicable to this presentation; although I believe that what I&#39;ve written is generally true."
Why would you make the music so loud you can&#39;t hear the speaker?
"Did the Oxford bring in a rebuttal? Otherwise, &quot;Debate Club&quot; really misinforms one in the English language. My wife and I, &quot;Boomers,&quot; never brought children into this world. We <i>adopted</i> two. There, that&#39;s my virtue-signaling bit. One other thing, refuse to allow any person&#39;s actions become the <i>measure</i> of your morals. Therein lies the easy path to sanctimoniousness...<br>Be well."
"Technological advances have saved humans time and time again, but with all technology it can be used for good and evil, hence we Nobel prizes, dynamite used in industrial mining a good thing, in bombs not so good, cars, vans, lorries replaced the horse, put produce emissions"
"Give me a break.  They say that most facts are made up on the spot, and this guy is an example of that.  Out of the 209 countries listed on the world&#39;s Carbon monitoring site Gr. Britain is the 17th highest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world.  <br><br>It&#39;s not about the U.S. and Gr. Britain making a difference by &quot;sinking into the sea,&quot; simply because the main climate change countries, &quot;the poor&quot; as he puts it, are South and Central America.  He says that &quot;they,&quot; the poor countries, are the ones responsible for climate change, and, as he states, &quot;poor people don&#39;t give a shit about climate change.&quot;  The truth is that the very countries he sites as being the most pollutive are actually among the least pollutive.  The further truth is that the people who are the least responsible for the problem are the ones that suffer from it the most.    <br><br>Beyond that, war is the single highest carbon emitter on the planet... it&#39;s ironical then that most of the wars being fought are started by the U.S. and Gr. Britain and are wars for resources in the very countries that he cites as being &quot;the problem.&quot;  The truth is that in a variety of ways, our highly mechanized, gas guzzling societies, and our war-like posture throughout the world, means that the U.S. and Gr. Britain have, more than any other country&#39;s on earth, been responsible for these countries being poor.  It is our colonialistic foreign policies that have been the determinants of these country&#39;s fate.  The U.S. and Gr. Britain could help these countries combat climate change, not only by example, (by doing our part), but also by lifting our oppressive thumbs off of them.  <br><br>The speech that everyone is talking about?  Hardly.  Nobody I know is talking about it... it&#39;s not worth talking about.  In fact, climate change is just one of many of the failing systems within the realm of what&#39;s called &quot;ecological overshoot&quot; (put that into your search engine)-- where many of the earths systems have reached the point of no return and are collapsing to the point to where they can no longer sustain the population.  Climate change is only a small part of this.  <br><br>This guy&#39;s full of shit, and if you believe anything he has to say you&#39;re as easily led as they come.   <br><br>Worldometer worldwide carbon monitoring meter--  <a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-by-country/#google_vignette"">https://www.worldometers.info/co2-emissions/co2-emissions-by-country/#google_vignette</a>"

What an almost impossibly stupid prat. I bet mummy&#39;s so proud of him !
Thanks!
"This is what the right wing bullshit sounds like.  Sorry, but you are NOT the first who said it JUST LIKE THIS..."
shameless dressing downof kids by a grown man
Brilliant! although I don’t agreed all what he said
Deliver the message without the music!   I switched off.
Is the music necessary?
He taks like a Goebbels… does not espouse necessary morals… he seems to take pride in his negatuvity and screw looking for the correct answer… just deliver his privilege.
perspective and delivery.....both outstanding...
"An amazing example of social engineering at its finest. The truth is we have all the tech needed for zero carbon free electric etc… we have all the tech needed for free unlimited clean water for the entire world and for food. All of that is available but we are not given that. Why? Because the elites don’t want to loose control and can’t accept that they, we, are all the same and the only difference between us and them is knowledge of the truth. Just like now they are trying to associate the people who are waking up and starting  to find out what’s going on as WOKE and that all they do is complain and want to be lazy and live in a sick fantasy world. That’s not true. Waking up and seeing through the deception is the truth and what they do not want"
WOKIES aid the enemies and corrupt ruin their own country to yell and scream to waste and distract everyone from the real problems that are being done to the country.
"You has million kid has no food and city is getting bankrupt <br><br>For Eastern large country please go there and see <br>People have enough food. <br><br>has the technology to build new and clean energy and cheap. <br><br>is doing for the climate change more than the west. <br><br>The west is using other countries made items, to cut out the pollution, so if the west is using the poor countries made, you are part of the pollution"

Brilliant speech
I can end this right now without all the fine words...<br><br>Climate Change is a HOAX to put fear in everyone while the few at the top cash in on OUR misery and stupidity...
Why not have this brilliant speech translated into as many languages as possible- and let it be broadcast  far and wide - all across our world!JaiHind!
Wow this guy explains things where we can understand it. Omg who is this guy never seen him or heard about him before
Well that changed a lot.
Turn down the damn background music.
"it sounds lame, to me..."
Spectacular speech!!!!
FANTASTIC  !
"I want to be mad, I want to be angry.....but I am among the poor of America; I live on $900 a month.  I do NOT want to be this poor but life has worked that out for me spectacularly and I am left at nearly 60yo with no retirement, no 401k, no funeral benefits.  I plan on giving my body away for parts and whatever else they can use of it.  I never have believed in cemetaries or funerals.  Use what you can, cremate the rest and make a pendant out of the leftover.<br>Point is that I have always been a social justice warrior and I wanted to hate this man, and his words BUT I CANNOT DENY HIS TRUTHS.   HE SAYS IT ALL SPECTACULARLY!! <br><br>It is unfortunate that in my country being woke has come to mean things that it isn&#39;t; what is even more unfortunate is that most of those against &quot;woke&quot; cannot even define it nor would they recognize it if they did see it because to them being woke means<br><br>LGBTQI friendly or allied,<br>Books about sex written for teenagers and young adults, <br>The beautiful diversity of our country and our planet,<br>And anything that isn&#39;t identified as evangelical Christian friendly.<br><br>You see these people aren&#39;t Christian anymore; in my country, they are Trumpers or as I like to call them MAGATs because they like to destroy lives and ruin people and then revel in what their hate has wrought.<br><br>Our world has a lot of problems but this gentleman says it quite rightly; the poor do not want to be or remain poor and if we want a world at all then instead of trying to leave it like Elon Musk, we need to work on providing clean ways of operating the systems of social movement."
This was not the end of woke but the begining of the end. Thanks konstinine we owe you.
Why the bloody music.???
Reasonable people know the ans
Salute
Wow
One of the most important speeches ever!
"Because there are many poor people in the world does not mean that we should not go on reminding people about the dangers of climate change. It is the fault of capitalism and communism. Trillions and trillions of dollars (or other currencies) are spent every year to kill people!!! Perhaps if we made better use of that money there would be fewer poor people. I notice that the speaker used communist countries to talk about poor people. There are just as many poor in capitalist countries like say Brazil, or India - and many more in Africa, Central America."
Common sense at last
1 in 10 comments are hateful 9 in 10 niceful 😅
Makes to much sense thats just not cricket 😅
"You cut off and edited some parts, let the whole thing play without omission"
Brilliant speech. Well said mate.👏👏👏👏👏👏
Mediocre and arrogant speech with a supremacy that is deteriorating day by day.
❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mbdp51O0J6Q&amp;t=150"">2:30</a>  Most people - worldwide - suffer from malnutrition - including the middle and upper class - they just don&#39;t realize it"
Great speech. <br>Nothing changes reality more than the application of the old rule: &quot;Put your money where your mouth is&quot;. <br>.
The last man pulled the best of the best one in the line up. 👌
I have a question but i mean no harm at all but why are there only a certain type of people selected. Im not from America but where are all the other ethnicities?
"First guy: I&#39;m looking for someone who&#39;s going to be supportive of ME, help ME with MY business and MY goalsanddreamsandWHATNOT<br>....no one popped their balloon 🤔💀"
Esther??????? 💔
"I love the show’s concept, but it could use a lil improvement. Such as; why have them stand for over an hour? They can all sit in a tall chair. 2: once the single person comes out, have a lil intro music instead of everyone just looking and waiting for them to come out. 3: once the single person has approached, have other men/women all state their names, age and occupations. That way they don’t have to say it on repeat every single that the person has a question, pop a balloon or get their balloon popped. Other than that the show is great and intriguing. I literally watch it everyday. Great show."
This first guy has not given any lady a compliment about her looks. He is gay!
"Ngl, &quot;First off Queen&quot; got me started on this show. I loved the way he clapped back. The women were extra rude tonight lool 😅"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=1055"">17:35</a> is way out of his league, I doubt that he&#39;s educated and she&#39;s studying to be a doctor. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=1205"">20:05</a> called it. He is not intelligent or educated."
Thought they were judgmental about Chandler but they were right all along! 😹<br>You deserve better Mishna!
I hate the first guy
They are all  wearing fake hair
First one says a microwave society we want things too fast just like how she wants long straight European fur type  flowing  hair too fast hence the fake hair wearing.  As a medical student she should be aware of the dangers  health risk of wearing fake hair.
Heavy make up and fake ridiculous eye lashes.
He says it hard to pop the balloons it didn&#39;t seems hard he just went right ahead and pop the balloons with enthusiasm.
Mothers  Mothers ps be a role model for your children
Bleached out no class
No class
Why do  these type of fake women  always flicking / stroking / playing with the fake eurocentric fake fur type  hair
Had to do a recap on Chandler 😅
whatever you say about the guy. he is the ghost; he just went home with the baddest one
"I think the girl in red, Briana is suffering from pretty privilege. I think, for my tastes, she is fine! but the attitude? If you watch her closely I think she rolled her eyes more than any other female, even when he was talking to other females."
The 22 year old taking Arlette’s microphone’s killing me!!
"The second guy’s the ideal look in a man.Tall, attractive and well-built."
"Now I get why so many black men are playing for the other team.  These women are, nevermind......"
Man women don&#39;t come looking for love they come looking for clout it&#39;s so annoying
Besides the fact that my boy seemed like he was bout to beat one of the ladies up 😂 Dog was really well spoken… I feel like he a really good dude 4real.. I feel like he probably had a hard time wit chics back in the day and that’s why he responds how he do when it comes to rejection.. BUT I DEFINITELY DIDNT SEE OL GIRL PICKING DAT BOY!! They say opposites attract!!
This episode annoyed me so bad. A lot of these girls need to humble themselves. The chocolate guy that was actually dressed like a man and not a 21yr old rapper should&#39;ve got way more acknowledgement than what he got. These girls look young and immature and I did not like the wardrobe on these girls. They looked like they were auditioning for a rap video.
"The girls were a little mean, but this last man was very critical of the intense criticism"
The last dude is something else mmmaaannnn You did me a favor baby
They always say Mother or Aunt when the lady is heavier. 😅
Antoine would’ve made a good match with Brianna…
I wonder what is this  22yrs old doing here.
Blue dress bad asl fw her vibe
"They were so mean to Shanlar, it&#39;s always the guys that I think are so cute and wholesome that they always hate on. They did the same thing to Pointer😭"
Girls tripping over 1 year age difference is super strange
The last dude I quote “ I don’t mean to be disrespectful but if I see you in public I won’t reach out “ 😂😂😂😂😂
"Short man did wayyyyyy too much the extra comments was really not necessary or attractive on him, but I do like how the young lady cleaned it all up at the end , he lucky she was still interested in him after all of that.."
"Bring back normal English. Stop with this &#39;Not giving&#39; , &#39;she ate&#39; and all that bullshit"
I like this show it kinda broadens my horizons in terms of dating. Like there is a lid for every pot. Entertainment. Plus I learn some new vocabulary on every episode. I believe it’s called “swag”
Mike Tyson son? Mick Tyson
"I honestly thought girl on blue was my age too (40) she does look motherly and even though it&#39;s not a bad thing, it&#39;s not what a 27 yo guy is looking in a 23 yo girl."
Love these so much. My 1 critique is that the intros are a little long. I always have to skip past.
Ninja Turtle 🐢
Ryan is a Taurus
i am cryingggggg bro the last dude got me weak
"The plumber should get his own show, he is the male version of Hawk Tuah"
Bro why all the girls are 🤮
The second guy they didn’t want to tel him he too dark
Can&#39;t believe who black dress ended up with
Kayla is so ghetto but I love the way she went off on ninya boy lol
He means a woman not to give him drama. A woman gives peace
Brianna should go to hair dresser and put clothes on
The host always laughing .
He&#39;s eating right and taking care of himself and she keeps asking more questions.  Girl bye
No man wants to date his mother ladies. He doesn&#39;t need another mother he wants a wife
"As a bouncer, I say the last guy is bad news. I would encourage all the ladies to pop them balloons for this one. No respect given there. The ladies are not the best fit for my choice either, but I won&#39;t bring them down like he did."
"The one in the red is not so bright, not meaning the host."
Arlette was shocked Ninja Turtle matched and so was everyone else on set and at home 😂😂
That girl in black at the front lost out on a really cute guy because he said SOMEONE ELSE looked like a mother. Wow.
Aron aka ninja turtle came on guns blazzing🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He got everybody lookin at their arms
That plumber is a star and girl in pink the baddest girl they ever had here
WTF these women talking about men wanting someone like their mother? So creepy and gross. No wonder they end up stuck with babies instead of full grown men.
The way Arlette says “we have a match” in complete disbelief at the last guy 😂😂😂
Dude got one arm bigger than the other i mean everyone has something going on but he act like he&#39;s dope crazy that tan shirt on ninja turtle 🐢
I came back to rewatch Chandler and Mishna’s episode SPECIFICALLY after the reunion and dude….he is definitely a chronic gaslighter. I didn’t get the vibe that he was “settling” or picked her because she was the only one left. He dead seemed like he liked her…like WHAT?!!! Am I being gaslit right now????😂😂😂😂
ninja turtle 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=3197"">53:17</a> Bruh would you wear that to a job interview???  Use your head, what do you think a first date is??  First impressions matter.  The outfit is giving, &quot;I don&#39;t really care to put in much effort for you or myself, I&#39;m a joke and don&#39;t take me too seriously.&quot;  And your response to her is giving, &quot;I don&#39;t really care how I look or how people perceive me, I would even wear this outfit to meet your parents for the first time because that&#39;s what makes ME feel comfortable.  I don&#39;t care if I come across as looking like a bum, fu*k your feelings.&quot;  <br><br>First impressions, I would pass too.<br><br>Does the dude really have on an anime shirt????  Yeah nothing screams &quot;take me seriously&quot; like an anime shirt  🙄."
"Soo, i saw the plumber clip a while ago and still think he&#39;s off. But after seeing these ladies interactions with other people they kind of deserve it,lol"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=1398"">23:18</a> , these girls attitudes are terrible"
bruhh the mother comment 😅
I really liked this one 👍🏽👍🏽
😂😂😂 the last one
one thing Arlette gonna do is adjust that mic when need be and make sure you don&#39;t walk off wit it 😅 also can I borrow your toothpicc so you can be eliminated lol
The girls who hung around for the plumber really want a to be mistreated 😂😂
Lol. I wonder how the last date went 😂😂
"That first lady left Ryan for Ninjaturtleman😅, she had the worst taste😅"
😂
First guy: he is SOOO out of these fat girls league
"I actually think the first guy is pretty good, he seems to have a good head on his shoulders"
Oh my God they let the plumber do too much. 😮 😂 He was scary and funny at the same time
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=2732"">45:32</a> Came back to watch Chandler 🫠🤦🏾‍♀️"
PICNIC⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=1482"">24:42</a> definitely giving Nigerian vibes ❤"
I😂😂😂😂 if i see you in public ill won&#39;t reach out
How does raggedy ass thrift store wearing clothes guy have the right to make comments on somebody else&#39;s outfit?!<br> Get down!!!
"It always bothers me whenever the guys say that the outfit isn&#39;t right on the women, claiming that they should have been more put together. Yet the one saying that is wearing paint splash jeans and a raggedy ass t-shirt"
That plumber make me SICK..lolololol Glad someone told his AZZ
Girl in black one-shoulder dress looks dated like she’s from 1989 or something.
“My parents are black black”-says the white guy!😂
Aaron is disgusting. 🤢 <br>None of the women were as rude to  Chandler as Aaron was to them. Aaron thinks he only has to be respectful to women he finds attractive. A 🤡
Chandler was def dominant
Ninja Turtle needs to lower the eyebrows when he talks.
Where bro got that bob marley shirt
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=1957"">32:37</a> ok I understand you have questions, but even I feel interrogated. She irritating, like daaaaayuuumm pop that mf🤣<br>🎈📌💢"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=2735"">45:35</a>"
Chandler really played her. He did not have to match with her if he knew he wasn’t attracted to her or interested
I’m so confused about what’s happening with the last guy and girl. Is she gonna publicly humiliate him? This can’t be a real match.
"“You not qualified, baby” is my new phrase. 😂"
"Woman in red, 4th one down, looks a little wild 😂 Where y’all find her? She’s on drugs fr"
"I&#39;m sorry, but i don&#39;t see any resemblance to the beautiful Janet Jackson in the young lady, although she is cute."
I&#39;m getting brainwashed into these Gournmet Pies! How was he even allowed to advertise his pies soo heavily haahahahaha
"The first girl is soo Fking dumb, like why not say from the start cause of your brand deals, I can&#39;t specify my exact age but it&#39;s around 30-33, or 35-38, like Shee not only withholding information but a Pathological liar!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4087"">1:08:07</a> A truly regal, beautiful couple. Class will Always win out."
The 1st broad trippN what makes her think she comes before somebody’s child if it was hers she would put her kid first like wth wrong with these woman 😂
Janet Jackson! He needs new classes. Hell No!
Came back after the reunion to rewatch the proposal 😊
Sorry but James with gourmet pies was annoying AF! Dont come on here to promote your phucking pies! You actually DETERRED people from supporting
saw the TikTok clip and had to come watch. im in my mid 20s and I loved the maturity in this video. the last girl was my fav. she had a whole vibe to her that makes you want to be her friend.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4980"">1:23:00</a> He was itching to pop that balloon. I just knew he would wait until last minute to pop his balloon, but he wasn&#39;t banking on his cousin getting that date."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=135"">2:15</a> sounds practised script 😂😂😂"
The girl who is a systems wearing all white is &quot;let me lock in&quot; fine. 😅
what is the first guy wearing??? lmao
Very good line up
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4640"">1:17:20</a> she seems genuine, I watched the catch-up with her and her match a few weeks ago."
James gourmet pies!
Shawty in the pink pants STRANGE AF!
Man where she gone find men over 30 with no kids most men kids are almost grown and she want to start girl bye
the wanna be comedian is an idiot
Not that man with the afro saying you welcome after complimenting her ahahahah sour!!!
"Yall tripp8ng about the &quot;black barbie &quot;. She doesnt come off too friendly, not smiling much l, and has a bad wig"
"When the Barber said he was a Barber, I had to zoom in"
It’s so sad it feels like the light skin girls get chosen or are given more of a chance <br>The darker skin or more melanated get popped soooo quickly like superficial much ?
Brian fine af
Will someone please pick James and them darn pies 🥴
He&#39;s going to need a bigger oven.
This first lady is annoying! She shouldn&#39;t be allowed to not say her age.
These men are fussy man she was a ten
They are talking about superficial things that can be adjusted. A physical attraction is a must first.
James w james gourmet pies been on this show a million times that man there to promote 😹
Did they mamas not teach them to not say  you think someone older
"The First Lady was great, only thing is her not telling her age. 😬 Yeah, I don’t trust nor like that."
the comedian trying to be funny but not being funny is so annoying
“Permanent” bru got the Kevin gates vibe 😂🤣
"If you didn’t learn anything from this video, you learned that “James gourmet pies shops nationwide”<br><br>Lemme go order some of bru pies 💯😂(pause)"
Men on the suit has WISDOM 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
The man in purple is legit handsome! I don’t understand all the balloon pops! Him and the gentleman with the blk/white shirt next to him.. both handsome men!
She doesn&#39;t like the Angela Bassett comment lmao
I would&#39;ve kicked James off the show after the 3rd JAMES GORMET PIES TBH He&#39;s clearly there only to sale his business
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4212"">1:10:12</a> &quot;I hope you find your match today.&quot; HOW SWAY EVERYONE POPPED THEIR BALLON 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Prince is a Lil weird lol
"why did you pop his  balloon?  Mini skirt woman says &quot;Honestly,that was really hard!,i guess the attraction level wasn&#39;t really there&quot; 👀Uuuum,why was it so hard then 🤯😂😂"
Y’all fumbled the dental student 🤦‍♂️
Last guy is just there to plug in his Instagram 😂😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=1665"">27:45</a> <br><br><br>👆"
"Russell Westbrook (Bryan) has an attitude problem 😂<br><br>The commedian dude is just weird. <br><br>&quot;Rev. Luke James&quot; (Reginald) bagged him one😂<br><br>Ernesto with the fd up haircut, must have the front chair at the shop. 😂😂😂<br><br>Poet homie got a head like a Pez Despenser😂<br><br>James Gourmet pies is a marketing genius 😂"
The first dude in purple was fiercly trying to pop that balloon😅
I love james❤❤❤❤
the first girl is 35 🤨😒 you aint no spring chicken baby
This whole group of men good looking
James was there to promote his pies. He doesn’t give a damn about any of those women
All tall women all short men 😂
James is alright with me
not the cousins fighting out out for love bring bacc the gurl who sang the song 😂😂
so she just everybody fren 🙄
for the first match I&#39;m glad it was them 🎉
I see we have the consistent theme of the class clown
for some reason I really want a pie 😅
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4084"">1:08:04</a> yoooooo the comedians face 😂😂😂, is the same one I had… I honestly thought she was feeling the short king."
"Honestly, I thought Ryan was a man. Jesus lmao"
"Guys, learn from my boy Eric from the Yoruba tribe. His attire showed confidence and that he was different, yet he bagged the most beautiful girl on this episode. Pin this! Girls love different."
Reginald is a dream!!! He&#39;s one of the best men standing!!! Go Reggie!!
The first two are dressed terribly. The one guy w/that sweater full of wholes. Is that in style now b/c to me it looks awful.
I saw Eric in Episode 6.. Is it because the relationship with the person he met did not work out or is he a  volunteer?
"I never liked pie, but James made me start eating it. I had to look him up on Google, and unfortunately, he’s far away from me."
Can we all just appreciate Arlette for looking STUNNING every episode!!! QUEEN
Pink girl seemed so hurt they all popped 🥹
The tall guy (first one by Arlene) has had 2 matches I’ve seen so far. The girl in the white dress not picking shorty surprised me a tiny bit. He was talking good game lol. Maybe she could tell he was a douche lol
"If I hear James gourmet pies again, out this dude!!! I just may be convinced he’s sweet as James gourmet pies!! Dam, bro is the new improved Forrest Gump..🥴🥴"
Orange dress girl is beautiful but she stressed me out when she talked idk why lol
Mike popping on the curly haired girl 😒
A lot of these men missed out on a woman based off of what she didn’t like in the other men. How u gone compare y’all haircuts to each others…
Mike has the sexiest voice ever omg
The first girl has beautifullllll energy!
“You gonna have height surgery?” 😮😂😂😂😂 she believed that shit 😮
OMG Kay is so cute with that pixie cut and spring dress!
These tall girls got popped on QUICK!
This super religious dude is freaking me out.
Priest wanna be kevin gates so bad.
That comedian gonna be single<br>For ever 😂😂
"Did the first lady really just say she wants to be a priority over someone’s kid? I don’t know a whole lot of people who do that. And if they do, they’re not mentally healthy."
The third lady is just absolutely stunning ❤ Barbie vibes Naomi Campbell
Most of the time the guys are so respectful and mature while the girls are so shallow. What&#39;s up with that?
The second guy who popped his ballon said he like her natural hair…how does he know her hair is natural?😂

Reginald has a sweet, upstanding, Godly spirit... It&#39;s palpable. That&#39;s what i&#39;m talking about. Good man. Nothing against other guy, just saying. I pray those two are thriving. We need an update 😁 💕"

Why guy #1 dressed like that
"I thought Eric( the guy with the long black gown) got a match like few months ago in the previous video, so what went wrong with the match?"
"James, the Pie Man, is the most clever. 😂😅"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4394"">1:13:14</a> 😅"
Some of these Brothers look older then their age.
Arlette the host is the truth. Best lokking woman on the show.
Whats up with the comedian? 😅😅😅😂😂😂 He seems so unserious at times.
James gourmet pie he funny as hell😂😂😂n da uncle Charles dem two gettin they&#39;re shiiittt <br>💯🇻🇮🇻🇮🇻🇮🇦🇬🇦🇬🇦🇬 ONE 💞LVE<br>✌🏾OUT 🫡😛😜🤪
Why did the girl in pink wear that outfit??  It’s not flattering.
"The guy with the dangly scarf/hat on his head and all the holes in his sweater, is a damn weirdo."
Love from San Antonio!
Haven&#39;t we seen the Sade red/orange dress on a similar woman.<br><br>That leads me to believe the show provide dresses for the women who choose wear them. The show needs to vary their selection. All of the dresses are tight. Most are not very classy.
When a guy says he has no red flags. That means he has no standards. That’s why none of these chicks wanted anything to do with him having no standards means you’ll go for anyone or anything out of desperation.
Bryan lives on this show. I hope he finds love so he can take his aggressive ass home.
You don&#39;t like the pantsssss
Brian hates women
Do all these women sit on their back all day and eat?
Brian was too aggressive and he says he had no deal breakers and gives grace but in the end he was judgmental about the women their kids and the number of fathers. Double talk and I am not sure he knows himself. He felt rejected but he was because he was to aggressive.
Brian…. Brian….. top tier????  😮
M1st guy is confused and has been cheated on because of his short comings
So many contradictions
Brian was pissing me off. He clearly can’t take no for an answer!! Huge red flag!
"I&#39;m sorry, but pink dress got to much attitude, and the dress isn&#39;t flattering. You work for the county and have a son dressing like a 304"
That&#39;s right Brian! Hold these girls accountable
Boi your deal breaker is multiple baby daddies... could&#39;ve said that. But he came for war😂😂😂
Serious bbw here
"This was my favorite episode.  Most of the right questions were asked. The women were secure, professional, and knowledgeable about themselves. Very fun!"
"I’ll say this about the hostess, the only thing I’d change about her approach, I wouldn’t try and dig to deep into why someone isn’t interested. Once someone say it’s about tattoos or smoking, something that’s really about personal choice, I’d just leave it alone. Maybe it’s just me, but when you start digging, it gives the possibility for people to get too personal. If one is physically not attractive to someone. I mean we all are attracted to those we are attracted to. I just don’t want to hear that somebody’s nose is too long, a little to heavy, they have a scar on their leg that looks unappealing. Just keep it classy, respectful."
These ladies are too old to acknowledge that judgment isnt real and that having multiple children by multiple men isnt a good look.
&quot;You gon lie to the public? &quot;😂😂😂😂hilarious
Brian went there to win the prize but acting like he is the prize .
Shay is pretty but that dress looks like cheap prom. Her outfits on IG look much better.
Emotional intelligence is defined as your ability to identify and understand why you may feel the way that you do. All of those answers were superficial
Brian is such an a-hole
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWr-qjauKa0&amp;t=1893"">31:33</a> if you came here from the future (episode 24) to see Tim again. Here is your chance."
3rd dude dressed like he’s going to six flags w his son
3 kids from 3 different dads and you on a dating show.. yikes
"i think the first guy is from the ghetto, from new orleans"
First nigga a crash out 🤣🤣
That man is still looking for a good woman lol
He sounds institutionalized and for certain hates rejection!
He sounds like he’s institutionalized and for certain hates rejection!!
He sounds like he’s institutionalized and for certain hates rejection!!
"Calm tf down, Brian! Whoever hurt you is not on that stage.  Deal with your trauma, and you&#39;ll probably be a great guy."
"Can you never let Brian talk again? The more episodes I see him, the more he urks me. SHUT UP. You spit positive negativity. Split tongue ahhh."
Thin Shay in the purple dress got humiliated. 37 and still waiting to take her realtor exam. Definitely not a catch. Dude thought she was over 45.😂😂😂😂 Damn.
"A lot of people don’t understand Brian because Brian is a real man. He might be a little bit forward but he’s just being real and if he would like to meet me, I would love to meet him. I’m from the Bronx New York. I have a good amount of years over Brian, but I wouldn’t mind talking to Brian online, because that type of man, you know where is coming from and you know how to deal with him versus the ones who play games and constantly I mean, constantly changing their answers there’s feelings based on the mood of of the day"
"Honestly speaking, I am Mario O’Brien. He’s my type of guy, but I’m definitely older than Brian and the age gap is a bit. I have an 18 year-old son, but he matches my type of guy and this is a second time. I’ve watched the show because I admire him and his energy, his realness and the fact that he doesn’t base you on your past and that’s a beautiful thing thing."
the first man he is scary
Dude wit the box braids might like men tbh. Them women wayyyyy to pretty tf
He made the bity look bad
I think Reggie and the short girl in the brown dress would have made a great couple
"This Brian man got mommy issues and it screams arrogance, no birth father figure in his life, grew up with having multiple part time daddies."
The first one on the end dress like missus parker from Friday the movie
Brian is crazy ass shit!!! Run sis.... RUN!!!!!😂😂😂
I got a feeling Brian is gonna be on the ID channel next.
The popping balloon sound will forever fry me
"&#39;Top tier,&#39; he say.<br>That&#39;s rich coming from a slue footed man."
I wonder where Brian is from
"Black dress, that wig is not it. 😭"
3rd guy in braids was doing well until he said that lady is 45 😂
"First guy, and that&#39;s why you single."
"Brian was right and respectful, all these women will eventually end up with a bunch of cats that&#39;s for sure"
Dese girls lame as hell bruh
Arlette&#39;s got the mint mobile fit but it is clean
"&#39;twice is on you&#39; and all that fucking judging. Dude had me angry. Look at these fine women, not just out here looking like tens but also strong women, that raise kids all on their own and after past hurts still have the courage to look for love. Much respect and love to these women and a big &#39;f you!&#39; to stupid ass Brian (from the ghetto)."
1st dude got that liquor in his system this episode 👀💀
1st dude got that liquor in his system this episode 👀💀
"Christian was definitely my favorite, I’m so glad he found a match 🎉❤ happy for them"
The first guy is too aggressive to the ladies. He looks like a case waiting to happen.
Boy bye...
That 1st guy hates women
I hate when you ask someone for their toxic trait and they use that as an opportunity to toot their own horn. Like “my toxic trait is that I love too hard” 🙄🙄
She is not top tier  stop lil mama
They don&#39;t  get it they  challenging too make it make sense  these  dating  page  be all cap they ain&#39;t even looking for nobody  at all they just coming on her just to be seen  no cap or looking for contact these women  33 and up they need to get it together
i think he&#39;s from louisiana
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWr-qjauKa0&amp;t=3050"">50:50</a>  Agreed sir, you did a very nice job picking out your outfit and the jewelry to go with it, you look very nice.  The only thing I don&#39;t like about your outfit is the shoes.. Not a fan of the athletic shoes with dressy suit attire.  It&#39;s like me wearing one of their dresses with your shoes...  It doesn&#39;t look right...  To me.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWr-qjauKa0&amp;t=3109"">51:49</a>  Be careful girl with this generation hearing you say that,  you know that they don&#39;t like gender roles and love seeing males in dresses and finger nail polish..."
Out of all the ones I watched this one by far got the baddest line up
I thought you’re supposed to dress to impress?🤷🏿‍♀️ I can’t people go to a first date dressed like they’re going to the club.🤦🏾
"He is judging women with 2 children, but he has 1 child and is on a dating show? Also, he said he doesn&#39;t judge but out here judging these women?😅😅 what a joke"
"He is judging women with 2 children, but he has 1 child and is on a dating show? Also, he said he doesn&#39;t judge but out here judging these women?😅😅 what a joke"
Dude with braids like boys! Idc Idc!!! There&#39;s no way he ain&#39;t attracted to any of them and they all look different! 😂😂😂
The first guy irritated my soul. How do you start off saying you have no deal breakers but bash those women for having more than one baby daddy  🚩 I have 1 but I think it’s absurd to think the older you get there will be multiple women with one baby daddy interested in a A hole like this guy
&#39;how many baby daddies?&#39; ....
“U kinda remind me of my nephew”😭😂 that choke me…he really is 😂
Open to put asian women here at least they are actual women.  No drama or toxic
“My name is Christian” 😂💀
He said he didn&#39;t judge but he do smdh
Christian’s was the definition of a gentleman and I hope everyone of these women find their Christian that’s right for them
The second guy is broke. 1st guy told the truth! I&#39;m sorry he was on point.
"At first I was just listening and I kept thinking Brian is irksome, he like to repeat himself and hear himself talk, he a mild Dr Elom. Then I looked and realized it was that dude. He had a whole lot of deal breakers his first episode."
Why when one woman pop all pops? Followers
"To say making a mistake with any of the women’s baby daddies, give me a break, how many people have rose to greatness even tho their mama had a baby daddy that they felt was a mistake"
"Wow everyone of these women are drop dead gorgeous, first guy came off wayyyyyyyyyyy ridiculous"
Am i the only one that doesn&#39;t believe the one in the black dress is only 42?
"#1.... Phew!!!! This dude judging them on having children with more than 1 person, but he will be doing the same thing because he has 1 and wants more🙄 lol! <br>Plus the way he kept rubbing his  hand was giving me pimp vibes!"
"The first guy gives off some REALLY awful vibes. The constant hand twitching reminds me of my ex husband,   he always did that when he was about to explode in anger and scream at me. Whatever woman ends up with him, good luck. 😬"
Bring the first guy again 😂😂😂
Where do they find these men at 😭😭
Dude in Roberto Cavalli look emotionally unstable.
This line up …. Idk
Rate Brian yf
"Okay wow, definitely wasn’t expecting the worlds most condescending, hypocritical, and aggressive misogynist to open the show🤣🫨"
Brian S.B.E.&#39;ed those 304s too much.
He said he was a man of Top Tier on the pop the balloon show.
First guy talks tooooo much 😢
😂😂😂😂 the black forces ARE INDEED criminal!!!!!
I agree totally with the First Gentleman who spoke for all the real men that are still left on earth. God scripture is clear on how woman should carry themselves.
First guy talking about he got no deal breakers and don&#39;t judge women on their past then say it&#39;s women faults for having two baby daddies cause their destination is the fault from their first situation...
Josh look sudanese lol. The northern ones.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWr-qjauKa0&amp;t=1018"">16:58</a> Dude playing the role of the hunter with that serial killer look and walk back lol. A lot of people who just get out of prison have this. But it might be him naturally lol. Agressive Kirk Franklin."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWr-qjauKa0&amp;t=780"">13:00</a> actually... he&#39;s actually speaking facts lol. A lot of women don&#39;t like hard truth. Women be choosing the wildest guys and leaving lames/nerds to date women of other places, then complain about good men."
Ion see how they popped on Mr Will…. They must be blind 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Another briefcase ? 🫣😂
Who the hell gone marry a stripper lol😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KluNOvWjkWY&amp;t=3820"">1:03:40</a> this lady inconsistent"
Why did you pop the balloon? <br>She: &quot;He don&#39;t have enough base in his voice&quot;<br><br>You can&#39;t be that dumb😂
That feet guy is crazy
I’m so concerned for the girl on the end
"SE dc is crazy , it’s the hood he tried it sis"
Girl Sydney dates my brova smh
Big up Trinidad 🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹
So we did get a couple of popped balloons<br>Aka practically the whole damn room 😂
Your 5ft but he too short when he 8inches taller than u 💀
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KluNOvWjkWY&amp;t=550"">9:10</a> shows that she just wanted to be like everyone else and stay on the show longer smh 🤦🏾"
Not chapped lips😂
"It appears the last woman is struggling to articulate her thoughts in a logical manner, giving the impression of being somewhat detached."
The guy with the bag was almost perfect. WTH?
The chick on the end irritates the hell outta me.
LADY IN THE WHITE! (Second one) <br><br>I’m very surprised by how down to earth she was! You don’t meet to many women that look like that and aren’t shallow
Damn you can’t be a police officer now 😭😭😭😭
90% of the lady&#39;s are too pickie for being mothers and most have regreated turning down some of the young men ?? Good luck Lady&#39;s
"The &quot;exotic dancer chic&quot;,  was really pretty surprised not matched. On the other hand this show is a guilty pleasure that  I&#39;m kind of ashamed to  admit watching albeit the lost brain cells...😆"
They passing up a while Prince😂.  This show need more mature women   . The clothes don’t make a man ladies
From the moment first guy came on and started speaking I was like “look ah trini” b4 he even confirmed it 🎉🎉🎉
"The last girl is a demon from hell she is a follower, she don&#39;t have a mind of her own she have serious issues"
Idk why it so annoying when they pop the balloon while they still talking
“Chapped lips..”.     he licked them joints fast as hell😂
The last girl resembles Tamar Braxton.
They really said “Fk the police”
"Although this group of women were very sexy, it&#39;s still among the least impressive groups of women this show has had. The reasons for popping were insane, and they seem very entitled. And then there is &#39;Cee,&quot; the woman who was attracted to the first guy, the cop. She made it known she was attracted to him, but since he was the first guy introduced, she wanted to see if something better would walk out later. Notice at the end of the show, she left empty-handed. I do think the first woman picked (the one with the hat), was sincere though."
Nkiru is far from finding love
Nkiru 32 still selective oh my Nigerian sister please get a man you look beautiful
They keep rejecting while their age keep going up.. most of them pop because the person close to them did pop
"First guy , that lady girl is a 304 lol why she she didn’t have a problem with him being a cop but possibly could lol"
What was that last girl talking about? She did not sound intelligent at all with that reason. Looking like she 35 talking like a teenager lol.
Of course<br>She&#39;s  beautiful <br>Pretty much it<br>No judgement<br>Too light <br>Too short<br>😅😅😅😅
Bless up ya self
she aint no fun size in her two sister dress and rain hat
"I’m so saddened that women in general focus so much on height.. I understand preferences, but it makes me sad for the men with lots of potential.."
"This entire episode was exhausting until the last two dudes, lol!"
Kiana 32 im in the healtbheakt health fieeeeldd 😂 girl wear scrubs at a hospital cus you def not smart 😅 too much bleach
Christian life coach 😂 w them thangs out gurl
"Sticking to the code, she’s a follower she didn’t know how to even describe what she meant, and sounded stupid.. I love the show but she of the young woman pop for the dumbest reason.."
"I don’t understand the reasoning here... You already have three kids with another person, but you’re not willing to have more with someone who doesn’t have any children. That’s confusing!"
"Ladies with all due respect stop getting these big tattoos.<br>They look like big bruises.<br>Get a small tat, or none.<br>Y&#39;all are so beautiful without them."
Lexi is so beautiful and elegant
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KluNOvWjkWY&amp;t=1770"">29:30</a> that girl in red cried when the man with luxury car rental biz popped her balloon and moved on to the next. She was thinking it is a chance lost to become an instant sugarbaby"
As grown ass women yall are actually that bothered by law enforcement as a career???<br>please grow tf up
"I am so sick of adults, in their 20s and 30s,using height as deal breaker"
"Lexi, you know that is not your hair.  The hesitation!😅"
"The last girl in the lineup is a follower. She follows whatever the other girls do. She actually said so when explaining why she popped for the cop. And to top it all, she really wants us to believe she is a cna, a realtor, and she supervises a shoe store ?? Girllll stop it already."
"I’m home sick so I’ve been binge watching this series. I’ve learned how much women contribute to a very narrow and rigid definition of masculinity. Too short, too pretty, too flashy, too boring, too zesty, too quiet… it feels like society is trying to squeeze men into a very tiny box 😣"
Duffle bag talks way too much. I cant deal. I know Arlette was annoyed
Kiana does not look 32. And she cant think fkr herself lol wth
"You would think they’d WANT good black men to be cops. If they think there’s a problem, they could Help change the system"
What the last chic is weird..what&#39;s wrong with her
The &quot;Feet&quot; guy cracks me up! 😂
I think these women are trippin🤔 why&#39;s he a pretty boy because he gets his brows done????? Enlighten me please I&#39;m from NY And dudes get brows done like it&#39;s called personal hygiene smh
"I really like Allister! I liked his tone, responses, and appearance. I hope he finds love!!"
The lady with the green dress is gorgeous!
Tiffany should stay at home!!!!!!! Shes everywhere lool
"I get that attraction and looks matter...but I just don&#39;t understand the pickyness. What matters most is personality,  I would love if this show would do some blindfold things so people could get to know the person on the inside first."
the lady in the green outfit pop every balloon straight off.   she  looks hard to get along with.
Coming to America came to date some feet while walking like a 🦆. He was really mean and fake.
the height excuse is so lame.   like a tall guy will solve your problems
last girl should learn how to think for herself.  that dude was like a robot .
these chicks all have many different jobs no wonder they cant find a man.
What’s with the props? Are y’all checking these bags for safety reasons?
"waiting for someone better,  good for her.  i know she already very patient."
sheriffs and police are not the same.
They are so gorgeous but its a real turn off when she&#39;s too picky ir superficial. But then again we got guys like that Jamie Fox comedian guy with the dancehall hat and no socks😂. Wtf!!!😂. Both men and women can easily improve so many things if they weren&#39;t so selfish😂. Its not that hard to please an actual GOOD man.
"Look… strong, short men can throw you around 😉 and protect you when needed. Y’all need to quit."
Nearly everyone popped when he said he was a sheriff and I suspect the other ones didn’t because they didn’t want to make him feel bad.
The officer saying that dating the exotic dancer is a dealbreaker...is LYING!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KluNOvWjkWY&amp;t=1761"">29:21</a> that’s that fine lil shi"
Arlette always says we got a couple of balloons popped and it’s 7/9 women that popped. 😂😂
Da last pick was really hard da  exotic dancer wanted him  too...🤷🏾‍♀️ well he miss out on a good azz dance partner<br>💯🇦🇬🇦🇬🇦🇬🇻🇮🇻🇮🇻🇮 ONE💞 LVE <br>✌🏾OUT 🫡😛😜🤪
That guy with the weird hat and the foot thing was strange he cant talk about girls feet when he looks like that

"We need to see a convo between Coming to America, ninja turtle, and “Dr.” E"
"That last girl,  she&#39;s got a big ole bubble where her brain is supposed to be."
I think girl lied about her reason being because he was police... she popped b4 he said he was police.
@allistor 🇹🇹 stand up
"I’d love it if Mr I’m a Respectable Individual Police Officer.. ran his own successful youtube channel and went on to totally roast each and every single girl individually visually from head to toe and their demeanour uninterrupted, and he just waited it this episode out to do so 😋 women can be so phoney"
"Hey police bro, big up to you from sweet Trinidad and Tobago. Hope you find real love my Trini brother.  🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🙏🏽"
Supects in a dress.😂
"I love how the first guy carried himself, hopefully he finds a match someday"
The first guy i wasnt attracted to him and his muffin top he seems nice but not my type
This line up pressure 🔥🔥
Figures the only one that looks nice doesnt have a mind of her own🙄.  These ladies need to ask Arlette about how to dress.
The briefcase guy.... run 🏃‍♂️ get out the blocks fast
I love the blackjack man! Keep it up!
The nigerian woman she is so beautiful.❤
"From the moment I heard him, I knew he was a Trini. Big up Trini brother!!"
Kierra is about that bag. I think Moan and the second guy was a little too mature for the women.
First guy is the whitest black guy I’ve seen on the internet.
"Bro, this lady really said she was sticking to rhe code.... Translation: hive mind. <br>This is why we call women stupid and dumb. Missed out on a potentially good dude because of lack of social proof. Just wild!"
"Ohhhh God i was cringing so hard, i don&#39;t know what is this obsession with men&#39;s height???? I am 165cm ( i think that is 5.5) and i think 5.8 is a great height. The first man also sounded like a real gentleman i couldn&#39;t believe he was eliminated."
Davis Christopher Garcia Lisa Johnson Kenneth
"These women think a 25 year old Tyson Beckford is going to come around that corner lol. Maybe he will but don&#39;t count on it when a good dude is standing in front of you. The second guy looks like a great man. He&#39;s dressed well. He carries himself with confidence, respect, and presents himself well. The first girl finds him very attractive but because he&#39;s on point as the average height of a man (at 5&#39;8&quot;) it&#39;s a no go. Why are men single into their 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s? Because we aren&#39;t Tyson Beckford lol."
"How is a gift supposed to be earned? Anything that&#39;s earned is a transaction, Sir... a gift is a gift. It&#39;s something that is given out of love with no expectations in return."
Huberts definitely on his period
pressure buss pipes and balloons...LMAO
These dudes would not pop in real life
she’s literally black
is the tall bald dude literally gay or ??
Micah looks like p diddy
then they keep talking about the gifts like it’s common sense lmao 😂😂😂 if you love your woman you do it nobody forcing you
he tried to call the first girl feisty bc she made a valid point
The one that said she had lipstick on her teeth and hair pedicure was not right what an asshole he didn’t even look good so idk who is talking she was beautiful and classy those guys are jokers!
The first women will always be single and die alone with her cat
"“Shower me with gifts!” Not love. Not kindness. Not a happy life. Those are things to shower someone with too.  Gifts y’all!  You feelin me? And in return, I will do nothing but give you a hard time for the reminder of your life!<br><br>PS The Second Lady seemed really sweet. Even the guys who popped their balloons she was cool to. Even though most weren’t really deserving. And some of these guys had the personality of those pimps in all those black-exportation movies of the seventies. Or maybe it was just a bit of nervousness with these guys so they reverted to portraying a certain type of guy they feel is cool. That would be kinda juvenile if that were the case, but it is what it is.  Either way I feel she was much better off."
This group of 🥷🏾 must be 🌈 nun was wrong with any of these females.
La melted my heart with the he wants a black woman because you barely hear that now a days from black men 🥰❤️
Hubert definitely gives moody and nonchalant
Micah was lettin people down gently the whole time ! I don’t know what he was lookin for but it was not there.
These dudes are weird AF
Hubert play for the other team
"Why do they always back up like that, it’s not a rule to do so lmao it always gets to me 😭"
Dude in all black might be a  smoker the way he  holding that Toothpick
Saying that you lead but have your arm folded while referring to a woman as “mannish” is crazy work.
Hubert make funny faces lol
My baby girl in the light blue gown sweetness I need your instagram
"I really liked Danny. How many kids he had was kind of ambiguous, but he seemed kind and had good style. I say kind because for the first lady, he took the time to explain why the others had a problem with her wanting gifts. I feel like he talked himself out of it, but they seemed like a good match that would balance each other. 🤷🏽‍♀️ Hubert has been hurt before (probably bullied) and gives textbook incel vibes. Dude, you need to heal. You’ve already decided no one would want you, so you beat them to rejecting them first. But not only rejecting, you tear them down when they have done nothing to you but expose your fragile ego. You alone are creating the vicious cycle of rejection you feel a victim to."
Justice for the first girl
"Dude with a face tat should have been screened more, he seems like has a few loose marbles in there"
Ion like how they did my girl (2nd girl)
Bro jumped roped with his laces to pump his self up before the show 😂💀
"It looks like they don&#39;t like black, beautiful, and intelligent women."
Hubert is a B word
"I guess people want what they want. However, that first guy, hes going to have a hard time finding a woman who doesnt want kids and will just help with his kids. It’s completely unrealistic."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-YNkFCfK0&amp;t=3309"">55:09</a> WOW 😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️"
Not this man saying he wouldn&#39;t travel from ATL to Houston when he was ready to pick someone all the way in Wisconsin 😂
"The bald dude next to the last guy seemed unimpressed and disinterested in all the ladies but, was side-eyeing his neighbor with the shades zestfully the whole show and was giving all the women dirty looks 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Not understanding the African Diaspora is also WILD 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
"Everyone look at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-YNkFCfK0&amp;t=1743"">29:03</a> and pause the video to see Arlette face 😂 I definitely agree do not bring Hubert back 😂😂🙅🏾‍♂️"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-YNkFCfK0&amp;t=1153"">19:13</a> definitely love how she kept her composure, and kept it very demure. Cause man say them 12s are extra long with too tight bunny ears  don’t you think… 🙃"
Please dont bring Hubert’s ass back 😂😂
The 1st young lady &amp; the last with the red dress will forever be fine. Both of them look like the gym is part of their selfcare routines.
Poor Micah …. He was so nervous …. Very handsome
That First Lady is so beautiful and she deserves a better group of men who is willing to setup !
Johnny has been with another man before FAAAAACTSSSS 💯💯💯💯
These guys are all a no! 😂
Danny seems toxicccccc
I wanted Danny to find love❤
Danny is a time waster
Johnny seems homosexual
The 1st woman big red flag she don’t want to earn anything
"God, Spouse, Children.. that&#39;s the order, some of y&#39;all men need to learn this."
Hubert is so annoying. Like be ya self.
"This whole episode was cringy, especially with the first girl"
Hubert WTF did you come. The energy the whole time was like a kid in the candy store not getting their way! Like why come if he didn’t want to be there 🤦🏽‍♀️ that  🥷🏻 def waste ppl time cuz ain’t no way! How can we tag Arlette to let her know he’s not welcome HERE! 😒
Why is Hubert acting like he&#39;s cute??? Man barely a 3 steupsssss I could never.
Herbert go the hell home and don’t come back
Baaaaaaaby when Arlette said “ooohh!” I scrumpt!!! 😭😭😭😭
Some of these dudes are lame  . The excuses they make are ridiculous
Matured Women With Grace
Hubert is WAAAAAACCCCKKK!! 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Its like hubert was saying something to the guys because every time he said something the guy next to him pops his balloon 😮
Every time I watch this I realise black men are the problem and  don&#39;t know how to treat women. He popped his balloon because she wants the be a priority and love language is gifts. Madness.
red dress was talking toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much. felt like an eternity
These males are… children😅
"The first one with dude in the black just was wasting her time in the end. Asking all them questions, walked up there and everythjng, just to pop his balloon like sirrr😂. Go home Roger!😂"
Is Hubert okay?! Why does his face do that? 😂
That man not understanding what the definition of “opened to it” means is WILD! Y’all be blessed tho 😂
The 1st girl sounds dumb as hell. She will remain single for the rest of her life!
I don&#39;t understand why folks wear sunglasses inside.
Hubert is hella annoying!!! Ugh!!!!!
Hubert lost a bet? He’s so cranky… rude demeanor.
Was Hubart forced to be on the show?
Oouuu she’s a broward girl
Great  show Young lady and you be Slaying by the way.....
Do people no longer wait until marriage to have kids? It&#39;s crazy how many of these participants have multiple kids out of wedlock.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-YNkFCfK0&amp;t=350"">5:50</a> i agree with him. Its alot of stepmoms on reddit that talk about how much they hate the step kids and how much the neglect them. And these step kids are 3-7.  Put your kids first."
I think that men got the wrong idea when she said prioritize her.
Insecure men call confident and secure women “MANISH” 😂💀
&quot;Come with your best&quot; but you have on ripped shorts and half of a vest. When did that become fashionable?
This show shows how unintelligent people are based off a 15 second meet and greet 😂
Now Hubert 😒
hubert pissing me off
"In social contexts, people may look to the actions of others to determine what is appropriate or effective. Is there a possibility of people popping a ballon or hearing what someone said and ending up being influence? This can be a social experiment in itself."
The Girl in thr Green that took thr Wig off was the Most Beautiful to me. I would marry Her ...❤❤❤....... she taugh me something deep just by watching her.
😂😂😂😂 Musiq SoulChild was Wild AF
What were all the guys shaking like strippers ....i can tell thede niggas scared 😂
Hubert… Yo Hubert!! nah go ask Hubert.. who are you talking about? Hubert.. Michael been looking nerve and surprise at the same time. 😂 Fk’n Hubert
Traffic Control Man : a cross guard
Maaan Mike seemed so nervous lol he almost exploded
Give a like for Adrian Broner 🤣🤣🤣
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-YNkFCfK0&amp;t=3015"">50:15</a> Mike looks toooooo HYPED‼️💯😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭"
Gon be a Loooooooooootta Sangle broads around this bitch showtly!! Young Bulls are coming into a FIELD DAY of sorts......... wont end well though😂😂
I’m glad she shut up old man Hubert.
Nigga said have a good night 😂😂😂 what???
Who hubert think he is
Hubert lame ass was trying to clown her talking about &quot; I see a braid&quot; and GAGGED when she was bald underneath lmfaoo. Hubert irritating me BAD
I love the match between Chad and chick. They had the  best vibe and cute together
Lady in red is not too skinny.  Her weight is fine.  She is gorgeous.
You ladies absolutely suck.😂Too many good men went by. ❤<br>Redo!
"Lady in creme or white  outfit, is gorgeous."
"Hubert, you need to go home."
"Beautiful lady does not look as if she has any children.  She is gorgeous, beautiful body.  You two look great together.  Beautiful couple.  She made a great choice with this young man.  I think the two will make a great couple.  Congratulations you two.  Marriage will be on the agenda for you two.  Good luck."
The last man pulled the best of the best one in the line up. 👌
I have a question but i mean no harm at all but why are there only a certain type of people selected. Im not from America but where are all the other ethnicities?
"First guy: I&#39;m looking for someone who&#39;s going to be supportive of ME, help ME with MY business and MY goalsanddreamsandWHATNOT<br>....no one popped their balloon 🤔💀"
Esther??????? 💔
"I love the show’s concept, but it could use a lil improvement. Such as; why have them stand for over an hour? They can all sit in a tall chair. 2: once the single person comes out, have a lil intro music instead of everyone just looking and waiting for them to come out. 3: once the single person has approached, have other men/women all state their names, age and occupations. That way they don’t have to say it on repeat every single that the person has a question, pop a balloon or get their balloon popped. Other than that the show is great and intriguing. I literally watch it everyday. Great show."
This first guy has not given any lady a compliment about her looks. He is gay!
"Ngl, &quot;First off Queen&quot; got me started on this show. I loved the way he clapped back. The women were extra rude tonight lool 😅"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=1055"">17:35</a> is way out of his league, I doubt that he&#39;s educated and she&#39;s studying to be a doctor. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=1205"">20:05</a> called it. He is not intelligent or educated."
Thought they were judgmental about Chandler but they were right all along! 😹<br>You deserve better Mishna!
I hate the first guy
They are all  wearing fake hair
First one says a microwave society we want things too fast just like how she wants long straight European fur type  flowing  hair too fast hence the fake hair wearing.  As a medical student she should be aware of the dangers  health risk of wearing fake hair.
Heavy make up and fake ridiculous eye lashes.
He says it hard to pop the balloons it didn&#39;t seems hard he just went right ahead and pop the balloons with enthusiasm.
Mothers  Mothers ps be a role model for your children
Bleached out no class
No class
Why do  these type of fake women  always flicking / stroking / playing with the fake eurocentric fake fur type  hair
Had to do a recap on Chandler 😅
whatever you say about the guy. he is the ghost; he just went home with the baddest one
"I think the girl in red, Briana is suffering from pretty privilege. I think, for my tastes, she is fine! but the attitude? If you watch her closely I think she rolled her eyes more than any other female, even when he was talking to other females."
The 22 year old taking Arlette’s microphone’s killing me!!
"The second guy’s the ideal look in a man.Tall, attractive and well-built."
"Now I get why so many black men are playing for the other team.  These women are, nevermind......"
Man women don&#39;t come looking for love they come looking for clout it&#39;s so annoying
Besides the fact that my boy seemed like he was bout to beat one of the ladies up 😂 Dog was really well spoken… I feel like he a really good dude 4real.. I feel like he probably had a hard time wit chics back in the day and that’s why he responds how he do when it comes to rejection.. BUT I DEFINITELY DIDNT SEE OL GIRL PICKING DAT BOY!! They say opposites attract!!
This episode annoyed me so bad. A lot of these girls need to humble themselves. The chocolate guy that was actually dressed like a man and not a 21yr old rapper should&#39;ve got way more acknowledgement than what he got. These girls look young and immature and I did not like the wardrobe on these girls. They looked like they were auditioning for a rap video.
"The girls were a little mean, but this last man was very critical of the intense criticism"
The last dude is something else mmmaaannnn You did me a favor baby
They always say Mother or Aunt when the lady is heavier. 😅
Antoine would’ve made a good match with Brianna…
I wonder what is this  22yrs old doing here.
Blue dress bad asl fw her vibe
"They were so mean to Shanlar, it&#39;s always the guys that I think are so cute and wholesome that they always hate on. They did the same thing to Pointer😭"
Girls tripping over 1 year age difference is super strange
The last dude I quote “ I don’t mean to be disrespectful but if I see you in public I won’t reach out “ 😂😂😂😂😂
"Short man did wayyyyyy too much the extra comments was really not necessary or attractive on him, but I do like how the young lady cleaned it all up at the end , he lucky she was still interested in him after all of that.."
"Bring back normal English. Stop with this &#39;Not giving&#39; , &#39;she ate&#39; and all that bullshit"
I like this show it kinda broadens my horizons in terms of dating. Like there is a lid for every pot. Entertainment. Plus I learn some new vocabulary on every episode. I believe it’s called “swag”
Mike Tyson son? Mick Tyson
"I honestly thought girl on blue was my age too (40) she does look motherly and even though it&#39;s not a bad thing, it&#39;s not what a 27 yo guy is looking in a 23 yo girl."
Love these so much. My 1 critique is that the intros are a little long. I always have to skip past.
Ninja Turtle 🐢
Ryan is a Taurus
i am cryingggggg bro the last dude got me weak
"The plumber should get his own show, he is the male version of Hawk Tuah"
Bro why all the girls are 🤮
The second guy they didn’t want to tel him he too dark
Can&#39;t believe who black dress ended up with
Kayla is so ghetto but I love the way she went off on ninya boy lol
He means a woman not to give him drama. A woman gives peace
Brianna should go to hair dresser and put clothes on
The host always laughing .
He&#39;s eating right and taking care of himself and she keeps asking more questions.  Girl bye
No man wants to date his mother ladies. He doesn&#39;t need another mother he wants a wife
"As a bouncer, I say the last guy is bad news. I would encourage all the ladies to pop them balloons for this one. No respect given there. The ladies are not the best fit for my choice either, but I won&#39;t bring them down like he did."
"The one in the red is not so bright, not meaning the host."
Arlette was shocked Ninja Turtle matched and so was everyone else on set and at home 😂😂
That girl in black at the front lost out on a really cute guy because he said SOMEONE ELSE looked like a mother. Wow.
Aron aka ninja turtle came on guns blazzing🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He got everybody lookin at their arms
That plumber is a star and girl in pink the baddest girl they ever had here
WTF these women talking about men wanting someone like their mother? So creepy and gross. No wonder they end up stuck with babies instead of full grown men.
The way Arlette says “we have a match” in complete disbelief at the last guy 😂😂😂
Dude got one arm bigger than the other i mean everyone has something going on but he act like he&#39;s dope crazy that tan shirt on ninja turtle 🐢
I came back to rewatch Chandler and Mishna’s episode SPECIFICALLY after the reunion and dude….he is definitely a chronic gaslighter. I didn’t get the vibe that he was “settling” or picked her because she was the only one left. He dead seemed like he liked her…like WHAT?!!! Am I being gaslit right now????😂😂😂😂
ninja turtle 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=3197"">53:17</a> Bruh would you wear that to a job interview???  Use your head, what do you think a first date is??  First impressions matter.  The outfit is giving, &quot;I don&#39;t really care to put in much effort for you or myself, I&#39;m a joke and don&#39;t take me too seriously.&quot;  And your response to her is giving, &quot;I don&#39;t really care how I look or how people perceive me, I would even wear this outfit to meet your parents for the first time because that&#39;s what makes ME feel comfortable.  I don&#39;t care if I come across as looking like a bum, fu*k your feelings.&quot;  <br><br>First impressions, I would pass too.<br><br>Does the dude really have on an anime shirt????  Yeah nothing screams &quot;take me seriously&quot; like an anime shirt  🙄."
"Soo, i saw the plumber clip a while ago and still think he&#39;s off. But after seeing these ladies interactions with other people they kind of deserve it,lol"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=1398"">23:18</a> , these girls attitudes are terrible"
bruhh the mother comment 😅
I really liked this one 👍🏽👍🏽
😂😂😂 the last one
one thing Arlette gonna do is adjust that mic when need be and make sure you don&#39;t walk off wit it 😅 also can I borrow your toothpicc so you can be eliminated lol
The girls who hung around for the plumber really want a to be mistreated 😂😂
Lol. I wonder how the last date went 😂😂
"That first lady left Ryan for Ninjaturtleman😅, she had the worst taste😅"
😂
First guy: he is SOOO out of these fat girls league
"I actually think the first guy is pretty good, he seems to have a good head on his shoulders"
Oh my God they let the plumber do too much. 😮 😂 He was scary and funny at the same time
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=2732"">45:32</a> Came back to watch Chandler 🫠🤦🏾‍♀️"
PICNIC⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=1482"">24:42</a> definitely giving Nigerian vibes ❤"
I😂😂😂😂 if i see you in public ill won&#39;t reach out
How does raggedy ass thrift store wearing clothes guy have the right to make comments on somebody else&#39;s outfit?!<br> Get down!!!
"It always bothers me whenever the guys say that the outfit isn&#39;t right on the women, claiming that they should have been more put together. Yet the one saying that is wearing paint splash jeans and a raggedy ass t-shirt"
That plumber make me SICK..lolololol Glad someone told his AZZ
Girl in black one-shoulder dress looks dated like she’s from 1989 or something.
“My parents are black black”-says the white guy!😂
Aaron is disgusting. 🤢 <br>None of the women were as rude to  Chandler as Aaron was to them. Aaron thinks he only has to be respectful to women he finds attractive. A 🤡
Chandler was def dominant
Ninja Turtle needs to lower the eyebrows when he talks.
Where bro got that bob marley shirt
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=1957"">32:37</a> ok I understand you have questions, but even I feel interrogated. She irritating, like daaaaayuuumm pop that mf🤣<br>🎈📌💢"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=2735"">45:35</a>"
Chandler really played her. He did not have to match with her if he knew he wasn’t attracted to her or interested
I’m so confused about what’s happening with the last guy and girl. Is she gonna publicly humiliate him? This can’t be a real match.
"“You not qualified, baby” is my new phrase. 😂"
"Woman in red, 4th one down, looks a little wild 😂 Where y’all find her? She’s on drugs fr"
"I&#39;m sorry, but i don&#39;t see any resemblance to the beautiful Janet Jackson in the young lady, although she is cute."
I&#39;m getting brainwashed into these Gournmet Pies! How was he even allowed to advertise his pies soo heavily haahahahaha
"The first girl is soo Fking dumb, like why not say from the start cause of your brand deals, I can&#39;t specify my exact age but it&#39;s around 30-33, or 35-38, like Shee not only withholding information but a Pathological liar!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4087"">1:08:07</a> A truly regal, beautiful couple. Class will Always win out."
The 1st broad trippN what makes her think she comes before somebody’s child if it was hers she would put her kid first like wth wrong with these woman 😂
Janet Jackson! He needs new classes. Hell No!
Came back after the reunion to rewatch the proposal 😊
Sorry but James with gourmet pies was annoying AF! Dont come on here to promote your phucking pies! You actually DETERRED people from supporting
saw the TikTok clip and had to come watch. im in my mid 20s and I loved the maturity in this video. the last girl was my fav. she had a whole vibe to her that makes you want to be her friend.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4980"">1:23:00</a> He was itching to pop that balloon. I just knew he would wait until last minute to pop his balloon, but he wasn&#39;t banking on his cousin getting that date."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=135"">2:15</a> sounds practised script 😂😂😂"
The girl who is a systems wearing all white is &quot;let me lock in&quot; fine. 😅
what is the first guy wearing??? lmao
Very good line up
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4640"">1:17:20</a> she seems genuine, I watched the catch-up with her and her match a few weeks ago."
James gourmet pies!
Shawty in the pink pants STRANGE AF!
Man where she gone find men over 30 with no kids most men kids are almost grown and she want to start girl bye
the wanna be comedian is an idiot
Not that man with the afro saying you welcome after complimenting her ahahahah sour!!!
"Yall tripp8ng about the &quot;black barbie &quot;. She doesnt come off too friendly, not smiling much l, and has a bad wig"
"When the Barber said he was a Barber, I had to zoom in"
It’s so sad it feels like the light skin girls get chosen or are given more of a chance <br>The darker skin or more melanated get popped soooo quickly like superficial much ?
Brian fine af
Will someone please pick James and them darn pies 🥴
He&#39;s going to need a bigger oven.
This first lady is annoying! She shouldn&#39;t be allowed to not say her age.
These men are fussy man she was a ten
They are talking about superficial things that can be adjusted. A physical attraction is a must first.
James w james gourmet pies been on this show a million times that man there to promote 😹
Did they mamas not teach them to not say  you think someone older
"The First Lady was great, only thing is her not telling her age. 😬 Yeah, I don’t trust nor like that."
the comedian trying to be funny but not being funny is so annoying
“Permanent” bru got the Kevin gates vibe 😂🤣
"If you didn’t learn anything from this video, you learned that “James gourmet pies shops nationwide”<br><br>Lemme go order some of bru pies 💯😂(pause)"
Men on the suit has WISDOM 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
The man in purple is legit handsome! I don’t understand all the balloon pops! Him and the gentleman with the blk/white shirt next to him.. both handsome men!
She doesn&#39;t like the Angela Bassett comment lmao
I would&#39;ve kicked James off the show after the 3rd JAMES GORMET PIES TBH He&#39;s clearly there only to sale his business
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4212"">1:10:12</a> &quot;I hope you find your match today.&quot; HOW SWAY EVERYONE POPPED THEIR BALLON 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Prince is a Lil weird lol
"why did you pop his  balloon?  Mini skirt woman says &quot;Honestly,that was really hard!,i guess the attraction level wasn&#39;t really there&quot; 👀Uuuum,why was it so hard then 🤯😂😂"
Y’all fumbled the dental student 🤦‍♂️
Last guy is just there to plug in his Instagram 😂😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=1665"">27:45</a> <br><br><br>👆"
"Russell Westbrook (Bryan) has an attitude problem 😂<br><br>The commedian dude is just weird. <br><br>&quot;Rev. Luke James&quot; (Reginald) bagged him one😂<br><br>Ernesto with the fd up haircut, must have the front chair at the shop. 😂😂😂<br><br>Poet homie got a head like a Pez Despenser😂<br><br>James Gourmet pies is a marketing genius 😂"
The first dude in purple was fiercly trying to pop that balloon😅
I love james❤❤❤❤
the first girl is 35 🤨😒 you aint no spring chicken baby
This whole group of men good looking
James was there to promote his pies. He doesn’t give a damn about any of those women
All tall women all short men 😂
James is alright with me
not the cousins fighting out out for love bring bacc the gurl who sang the song 😂😂
so she just everybody fren 🙄
for the first match I&#39;m glad it was them 🎉
I see we have the consistent theme of the class clown
for some reason I really want a pie 😅
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4084"">1:08:04</a> yoooooo the comedians face 😂😂😂, is the same one I had… I honestly thought she was feeling the short king."
"Honestly, I thought Ryan was a man. Jesus lmao"
"Guys, learn from my boy Eric from the Yoruba tribe. His attire showed confidence and that he was different, yet he bagged the most beautiful girl on this episode. Pin this! Girls love different."
Reginald is a dream!!! He&#39;s one of the best men standing!!! Go Reggie!!
The first two are dressed terribly. The one guy w/that sweater full of wholes. Is that in style now b/c to me it looks awful.
I saw Eric in Episode 6.. Is it because the relationship with the person he met did not work out or is he a  volunteer?
"I never liked pie, but James made me start eating it. I had to look him up on Google, and unfortunately, he’s far away from me."
Can we all just appreciate Arlette for looking STUNNING every episode!!! QUEEN
Pink girl seemed so hurt they all popped 🥹
The tall guy (first one by Arlene) has had 2 matches I’ve seen so far. The girl in the white dress not picking shorty surprised me a tiny bit. He was talking good game lol. Maybe she could tell he was a douche lol
"If I hear James gourmet pies again, out this dude!!! I just may be convinced he’s sweet as James gourmet pies!! Dam, bro is the new improved Forrest Gump..🥴🥴"
Orange dress girl is beautiful but she stressed me out when she talked idk why lol
Mike popping on the curly haired girl 😒
A lot of these men missed out on a woman based off of what she didn’t like in the other men. How u gone compare y’all haircuts to each others…
Mike has the sexiest voice ever omg
The first girl has beautifullllll energy!
“You gonna have height surgery?” 😮😂😂😂😂 she believed that shit 😮
OMG Kay is so cute with that pixie cut and spring dress!
These tall girls got popped on QUICK!
This super religious dude is freaking me out.
Priest wanna be kevin gates so bad.
That comedian gonna be single<br>For ever 😂😂
"Did the first lady really just say she wants to be a priority over someone’s kid? I don’t know a whole lot of people who do that. And if they do, they’re not mentally healthy."
The third lady is just absolutely stunning ❤ Barbie vibes Naomi Campbell
Most of the time the guys are so respectful and mature while the girls are so shallow. What&#39;s up with that?
The second guy who popped his ballon said he like her natural hair…how does he know her hair is natural?😂
"Say that again. However, I can understand where she is coming from."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=3480"">58:00</a> I know the word says he who finds a wife finds a good thing, but she hit the jackpot!!! Reginald has a sweet, upstanding, Godly spirit... It&#39;s palpable. That&#39;s what i&#39;m talking about. Good man. Nothing against other guy, just saying. I pray those two are thriving. We need an update 😁 💕"
"😂 &quot;Turn it into art, make that money, take you shopping.&quot; Priest is hilarious!!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=3465"">57:45</a> I NEED AN UPDATE PLEASE"
Why guy #1 dressed like that
"I thought Eric( the guy with the long black gown) got a match like few months ago in the previous video, so what went wrong with the match?"
"James, the Pie Man, is the most clever. 😂😅"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4394"">1:13:14</a> 😅"
Some of these Brothers look older then their age.
Arlette the host is the truth. Best lokking woman on the show.
Whats up with the comedian? 😅😅😅😂😂😂 He seems so unserious at times.
James gourmet pie he funny as hell😂😂😂n da uncle Charles dem two gettin they&#39;re shiiittt <br>💯🇻🇮🇻🇮🇻🇮🇦🇬🇦🇬🇦🇬 ONE 💞LVE<br>✌🏾OUT 🫡😛😜🤪
Why did the girl in pink wear that outfit??  It’s not flattering.
"The guy with the dangly scarf/hat on his head and all the holes in his sweater, is a damn weirdo."
Love from San Antonio!
Haven&#39;t we seen the Sade red/orange dress on a similar woman.<br><br>That leads me to believe the show provide dresses for the women who choose wear them. The show needs to vary their selection. All of the dresses are tight. Most are not very classy.
When a guy says he has no red flags. That means he has no standards. That’s why none of these chicks wanted anything to do with him having no standards means you’ll go for anyone or anything out of desperation.
Bryan lives on this show. I hope he finds love so he can take his aggressive ass home.
You don&#39;t like the pantsssss
Brian hates women
Do all these women sit on their back all day and eat?
Brian was too aggressive and he says he had no deal breakers and gives grace but in the end he was judgmental about the women their kids and the number of fathers. Double talk and I am not sure he knows himself. He felt rejected but he was because he was to aggressive.
Brian…. Brian….. top tier????  😮
M1st guy is confused and has been cheated on because of his short comings
So many contradictions
Brian was pissing me off. He clearly can’t take no for an answer!! Huge red flag!
"I&#39;m sorry, but pink dress got to much attitude, and the dress isn&#39;t flattering. You work for the county and have a son dressing like a 304"
That&#39;s right Brian! Hold these girls accountable
Boi your deal breaker is multiple baby daddies... could&#39;ve said that. But he came for war😂😂😂
Serious bbw here
"This was my favorite episode.  Most of the right questions were asked. The women were secure, professional, and knowledgeable about themselves. Very fun!"
"I’ll say this about the hostess, the only thing I’d change about her approach, I wouldn’t try and dig to deep into why someone isn’t interested. Once someone say it’s about tattoos or smoking, something that’s really about personal choice, I’d just leave it alone. Maybe it’s just me, but when you start digging, it gives the possibility for people to get too personal. If one is physically not attractive to someone. I mean we all are attracted to those we are attracted to. I just don’t want to hear that somebody’s nose is too long, a little to heavy, they have a scar on their leg that looks unappealing. Just keep it classy, respectful."
These ladies are too old to acknowledge that judgment isnt real and that having multiple children by multiple men isnt a good look.
&quot;You gon lie to the public? &quot;😂😂😂😂hilarious
Brian went there to win the prize but acting like he is the prize .
Shay is pretty but that dress looks like cheap prom. Her outfits on IG look much better.
Emotional intelligence is defined as your ability to identify and understand why you may feel the way that you do. All of those answers were superficial
Brian is such an a-hole
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWr-qjauKa0&amp;t=1893"">31:33</a> if you came here from the future (episode 24) to see Tim again. Here is your chance."
3rd dude dressed like he’s going to six flags w his son
3 kids from 3 different dads and you on a dating show.. yikes
"i think the first guy is from the ghetto, from new orleans"
First nigga a crash out 🤣🤣
That man is still looking for a good woman lol
He sounds institutionalized and for certain hates rejection!
He sounds like he’s institutionalized and for certain hates rejection!!
He sounds like he’s institutionalized and for certain hates rejection!!
"Calm tf down, Brian! Whoever hurt you is not on that stage.  Deal with your trauma, and you&#39;ll probably be a great guy."
"Can you never let Brian talk again? The more episodes I see him, the more he urks me. SHUT UP. You spit positive negativity. Split tongue ahhh."
Thin Shay in the purple dress got humiliated. 37 and still waiting to take her realtor exam. Definitely not a catch. Dude thought she was over 45.😂😂😂😂 Damn.
"A lot of people don’t understand Brian because Brian is a real man. He might be a little bit forward but he’s just being real and if he would like to meet me, I would love to meet him. I’m from the Bronx New York. I have a good amount of years over Brian, but I wouldn’t mind talking to Brian online, because that type of man, you know where is coming from and you know how to deal with him versus the ones who play games and constantly I mean, constantly changing their answers there’s feelings based on the mood of of the day"
"Honestly speaking, I am Mario O’Brien. He’s my type of guy, but I’m definitely older than Brian and the age gap is a bit. I have an 18 year-old son, but he matches my type of guy and this is a second time. I’ve watched the show because I admire him and his energy, his realness and the fact that he doesn’t base you on your past and that’s a beautiful thing thing."
the first man he is scary
Dude wit the box braids might like men tbh. Them women wayyyyy to pretty tf
He made the bity look bad
I think Reggie and the short girl in the brown dress would have made a great couple
"This Brian man got mommy issues and it screams arrogance, no birth father figure in his life, grew up with having multiple part time daddies."
The first one on the end dress like missus parker from Friday the movie
Brian is crazy ass shit!!! Run sis.... RUN!!!!!😂😂😂
I got a feeling Brian is gonna be on the ID channel next.
The popping balloon sound will forever fry me
"&#39;Top tier,&#39; he say.<br>That&#39;s rich coming from a slue footed man."
I wonder where Brian is from
"Black dress, that wig is not it. 😭"
3rd guy in braids was doing well until he said that lady is 45 😂
"First guy, and that&#39;s why you single."
"Brian was right and respectful, all these women will eventually end up with a bunch of cats that&#39;s for sure"
Dese girls lame as hell bruh
Arlette&#39;s got the mint mobile fit but it is clean
"&#39;twice is on you&#39; and all that fucking judging. Dude had me angry. Look at these fine women, not just out here looking like tens but also strong women, that raise kids all on their own and after past hurts still have the courage to look for love. Much respect and love to these women and a big &#39;f you!&#39; to stupid ass Brian (from the ghetto)."
1st dude got that liquor in his system this episode 👀💀
1st dude got that liquor in his system this episode 👀💀
"Christian was definitely my favorite, I’m so glad he found a match 🎉❤ happy for them"
The first guy is too aggressive to the ladies. He looks like a case waiting to happen.
Boy bye...
That 1st guy hates women
I hate when you ask someone for their toxic trait and they use that as an opportunity to toot their own horn. Like “my toxic trait is that I love too hard” 🙄🙄
She is not top tier  stop lil mama
They don&#39;t  get it they  challenging too make it make sense  these  dating  page  be all cap they ain&#39;t even looking for nobody  at all they just coming on her just to be seen  no cap or looking for contact these women  33 and up they need to get it together
i think he&#39;s from louisiana
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWr-qjauKa0&amp;t=3050"">50:50</a>  Agreed sir, you did a very nice job picking out your outfit and the jewelry to go with it, you look very nice.  The only thing I don&#39;t like about your outfit is the shoes.. Not a fan of the athletic shoes with dressy suit attire.  It&#39;s like me wearing one of their dresses with your shoes...  It doesn&#39;t look right...  To me.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWr-qjauKa0&amp;t=3109"">51:49</a>  Be careful girl with this generation hearing you say that,  you know that they don&#39;t like gender roles and love seeing males in dresses and finger nail polish..."
Out of all the ones I watched this one by far got the baddest line up
I thought you’re supposed to dress to impress?🤷🏿‍♀️ I can’t people go to a first date dressed like they’re going to the club.🤦🏾
"He is judging women with 2 children, but he has 1 child and is on a dating show? Also, he said he doesn&#39;t judge but out here judging these women?😅😅 what a joke"
"He is judging women with 2 children, but he has 1 child and is on a dating show? Also, he said he doesn&#39;t judge but out here judging these women?😅😅 what a joke"
Dude with braids like boys! Idc Idc!!! There&#39;s no way he ain&#39;t attracted to any of them and they all look different! 😂😂😂
The first guy irritated my soul. How do you start off saying you have no deal breakers but bash those women for having more than one baby daddy  🚩 I have 1 but I think it’s absurd to think the older you get there will be multiple women with one baby daddy interested in a A hole like this guy
&#39;how many baby daddies?&#39; ....
“U kinda remind me of my nephew”😭😂 that choke me…he really is 😂
Open to put asian women here at least they are actual women.  No drama or toxic
“My name is Christian” 😂💀
He said he didn&#39;t judge but he do smdh
Christian’s was the definition of a gentleman and I hope everyone of these women find their Christian that’s right for them
The second guy is broke. 1st guy told the truth! I&#39;m sorry he was on point.
"At first I was just listening and I kept thinking Brian is irksome, he like to repeat himself and hear himself talk, he a mild Dr Elom. Then I looked and realized it was that dude. He had a whole lot of deal breakers his first episode."
Why when one woman pop all pops? Followers
"To say making a mistake with any of the women’s baby daddies, give me a break, how many people have rose to greatness even tho their mama had a baby daddy that they felt was a mistake"
"Wow everyone of these women are drop dead gorgeous, first guy came off wayyyyyyyyyyy ridiculous"
Am i the only one that doesn&#39;t believe the one in the black dress is only 42?
"#1.... Phew!!!! This dude judging them on having children with more than 1 person, but he will be doing the same thing because he has 1 and wants more🙄 lol! <br>Plus the way he kept rubbing his  hand was giving me pimp vibes!"
"The first guy gives off some REALLY awful vibes. The constant hand twitching reminds me of my ex husband,   he always did that when he was about to explode in anger and scream at me. Whatever woman ends up with him, good luck. 😬"
Bring the first guy again 😂😂😂
Where do they find these men at 😭😭
Dude in Roberto Cavalli look emotionally unstable.
This line up …. Idk
Rate Brian yf
"Okay wow, definitely wasn’t expecting the worlds most condescending, hypocritical, and aggressive misogynist to open the show🤣🫨"
Brian S.B.E.&#39;ed those 304s too much.
He said he was a man of Top Tier on the pop the balloon show.
First guy talks tooooo much 😢
😂😂😂😂 the black forces ARE INDEED criminal!!!!!
I agree totally with the First Gentleman who spoke for all the real men that are still left on earth. God scripture is clear on how woman should carry themselves.
First guy talking about he got no deal breakers and don&#39;t judge women on their past then say it&#39;s women faults for having two baby daddies cause their destination is the fault from their first situation...
Josh look sudanese lol. The northern ones.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWr-qjauKa0&amp;t=1018"">16:58</a> Dude playing the role of the hunter with that serial killer look and walk back lol. A lot of people who just get out of prison have this. But it might be him naturally lol. Agressive Kirk Franklin."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWr-qjauKa0&amp;t=780"">13:00</a> actually... he&#39;s actually speaking facts lol. A lot of women don&#39;t like hard truth. Women be choosing the wildest guys and leaving lames/nerds to date women of other places, then complain about good men."
Ion see how they popped on Mr Will…. They must be blind 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Another briefcase ? 🫣😂
Who the hell gone marry a stripper lol😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KluNOvWjkWY&amp;t=3820"">1:03:40</a> this lady inconsistent"
Why did you pop the balloon? <br>She: &quot;He don&#39;t have enough base in his voice&quot;<br><br>You can&#39;t be that dumb😂
That feet guy is crazy
I’m so concerned for the girl on the end
"SE dc is crazy , it’s the hood he tried it sis"
Girl Sydney dates my brova smh
Big up Trinidad 🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹
So we did get a couple of popped balloons<br>Aka practically the whole damn room 😂
Your 5ft but he too short when he 8inches taller than u 💀
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KluNOvWjkWY&amp;t=550"">9:10</a> shows that she just wanted to be like everyone else and stay on the show longer smh 🤦🏾"
Not chapped lips😂
"It appears the last woman is struggling to articulate her thoughts in a logical manner, giving the impression of being somewhat detached."
The guy with the bag was almost perfect. WTH?
The chick on the end irritates the hell outta me.
LADY IN THE WHITE! (Second one) <br><br>I’m very surprised by how down to earth she was! You don’t meet to many women that look like that and aren’t shallow
Damn you can’t be a police officer now 😭😭😭😭
90% of the lady&#39;s are too pickie for being mothers and most have regreated turning down some of the young men ?? Good luck Lady&#39;s
"The &quot;exotic dancer chic&quot;,  was really pretty surprised not matched. On the other hand this show is a guilty pleasure that  I&#39;m kind of ashamed to  admit watching albeit the lost brain cells...😆"
They passing up a while Prince😂.  This show need more mature women   . The clothes don’t make a man ladies
From the moment first guy came on and started speaking I was like “look ah trini” b4 he even confirmed it 🎉🎉🎉
"The last girl is a demon from hell she is a follower, she don&#39;t have a mind of her own she have serious issues"
Idk why it so annoying when they pop the balloon while they still talking
“Chapped lips..”.     he licked them joints fast as hell😂
The last girl resembles Tamar Braxton.
They really said “Fk the police”
"Although this group of women were very sexy, it&#39;s still among the least impressive groups of women this show has had. The reasons for popping were insane, and they seem very entitled. And then there is &#39;Cee,&quot; the woman who was attracted to the first guy, the cop. She made it known she was attracted to him, but since he was the first guy introduced, she wanted to see if something better would walk out later. Notice at the end of the show, she left empty-handed. I do think the first woman picked (the one with the hat), was sincere though."
Nkiru is far from finding love
Nkiru 32 still selective oh my Nigerian sister please get a man you look beautiful
They keep rejecting while their age keep going up.. most of them pop because the person close to them did pop
"First guy , that lady girl is a 304 lol why she she didn’t have a problem with him being a cop but possibly could lol"
What was that last girl talking about? She did not sound intelligent at all with that reason. Looking like she 35 talking like a teenager lol.
Of course<br>She&#39;s  beautiful <br>Pretty much it<br>No judgement<br>Too light <br>Too short<br>😅😅😅😅
Bless up ya self
she aint no fun size in her two sister dress and rain hat
"I’m so saddened that women in general focus so much on height.. I understand preferences, but it makes me sad for the men with lots of potential.."
"This entire episode was exhausting until the last two dudes, lol!"
Kiana 32 im in the healtbheakt health fieeeeldd 😂 girl wear scrubs at a hospital cus you def not smart 😅 too much bleach
Christian life coach 😂 w them thangs out gurl
"Sticking to the code, she’s a follower she didn’t know how to even describe what she meant, and sounded stupid.. I love the show but she of the young woman pop for the dumbest reason.."
"I don’t understand the reasoning here... You already have three kids with another person, but you’re not willing to have more with someone who doesn’t have any children. That’s confusing!"
"Ladies with all due respect stop getting these big tattoos.<br>They look like big bruises.<br>Get a small tat, or none.<br>Y&#39;all are so beautiful without them."
Lexi is so beautiful and elegant
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KluNOvWjkWY&amp;t=1770"">29:30</a> that girl in red cried when the man with luxury car rental biz popped her balloon and moved on to the next. She was thinking it is a chance lost to become an instant sugarbaby"
As grown ass women yall are actually that bothered by law enforcement as a career???<br>please grow tf up
"I am so sick of adults, in their 20s and 30s,using height as deal breaker"
"Lexi, you know that is not your hair.  The hesitation!😅"
"The last girl in the lineup is a follower. She follows whatever the other girls do. She actually said so when explaining why she popped for the cop. And to top it all, she really wants us to believe she is a cna, a realtor, and she supervises a shoe store ?? Girllll stop it already."
"I’m home sick so I’ve been binge watching this series. I’ve learned how much women contribute to a very narrow and rigid definition of masculinity. Too short, too pretty, too flashy, too boring, too zesty, too quiet… it feels like society is trying to squeeze men into a very tiny box 😣"
Duffle bag talks way too much. I cant deal. I know Arlette was annoyed
Kiana does not look 32. And she cant think fkr herself lol wth
"You would think they’d WANT good black men to be cops. If they think there’s a problem, they could Help change the system"
What the last chic is weird..what&#39;s wrong with her
The &quot;Feet&quot; guy cracks me up! 😂
I think these women are trippin🤔 why&#39;s he a pretty boy because he gets his brows done????? Enlighten me please I&#39;m from NY And dudes get brows done like it&#39;s called personal hygiene smh
"I really like Allister! I liked his tone, responses, and appearance. I hope he finds love!!"
The lady with the green dress is gorgeous!
Tiffany should stay at home!!!!!!! Shes everywhere lool
"I get that attraction and looks matter...but I just don&#39;t understand the pickyness. What matters most is personality,  I would love if this show would do some blindfold things so people could get to know the person on the inside first."
the lady in the green outfit pop every balloon straight off.   she  looks hard to get along with.
Coming to America came to date some feet while walking like a 🦆. He was really mean and fake.
the height excuse is so lame.   like a tall guy will solve your problems
last girl should learn how to think for herself.  that dude was like a robot .
these chicks all have many different jobs no wonder they cant find a man.
What’s with the props? Are y’all checking these bags for safety reasons?
"waiting for someone better,  good for her.  i know she already very patient."
sheriffs and police are not the same.
They are so gorgeous but its a real turn off when she&#39;s too picky ir superficial. But then again we got guys like that Jamie Fox comedian guy with the dancehall hat and no socks😂. Wtf!!!😂. Both men and women can easily improve so many things if they weren&#39;t so selfish😂. Its not that hard to please an actual GOOD man.
"Look… strong, short men can throw you around 😉 and protect you when needed. Y’all need to quit."
Nearly everyone popped when he said he was a sheriff and I suspect the other ones didn’t because they didn’t want to make him feel bad.
The officer saying that dating the exotic dancer is a dealbreaker...is LYING!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KluNOvWjkWY&amp;t=1761"">29:21</a> that’s that fine lil shi"
Arlette always says we got a couple of balloons popped and it’s 7/9 women that popped. 😂😂
Da last pick was really hard da  exotic dancer wanted him  too...🤷🏾‍♀️ well he miss out on a good azz dance partner<br>💯🇦🇬🇦🇬🇦🇬🇻🇮🇻🇮🇻🇮 ONE💞 LVE <br>✌🏾OUT 🫡😛😜🤪
That guy with the weird hat and the foot thing was strange he cant talk about girls feet when he looks like that
Da lady in da green sounds like she from nigeria 🇳🇬  i knw she from an island 🏝 fo shizzle my nizzle <br>💯🇦🇬🇦🇬🇦🇬🇻🇮🇻🇮🇻🇮 ONE💞 LVE <br>✌🏾OUT 🫡😛😜🤪

"We need to see a convo between Coming to America, ninja turtle, and “Dr.” E"
"That last girl,  she&#39;s got a big ole bubble where her brain is supposed to be."
I think girl lied about her reason being because he was police... she popped b4 he said he was police.
@allistor 🇹🇹 stand up
"I’d love it if Mr I’m a Respectable Individual Police Officer.. ran his own successful youtube channel and went on to totally roast each and every single girl individually visually from head to toe and their demeanour uninterrupted, and he just waited it this episode out to do so 😋 women can be so phoney"
"Hey police bro, big up to you from sweet Trinidad and Tobago. Hope you find real love my Trini brother.  🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🙏🏽"
Supects in a dress.😂
"I love how the first guy carried himself, hopefully he finds a match someday"
The first guy i wasnt attracted to him and his muffin top he seems nice but not my type
This line up pressure 🔥🔥
Figures the only one that looks nice doesnt have a mind of her own🙄.  These ladies need to ask Arlette about how to dress.
The briefcase guy.... run 🏃‍♂️ get out the blocks fast
I love the blackjack man! Keep it up!
The nigerian woman she is so beautiful.❤
"From the moment I heard him, I knew he was a Trini. Big up Trini brother!!"
Kierra is about that bag. I think Moan and the second guy was a little too mature for the women.
First guy is the whitest black guy I’ve seen on the internet.
"Bro, this lady really said she was sticking to rhe code.... Translation: hive mind. <br>This is why we call women stupid and dumb. Missed out on a potentially good dude because of lack of social proof. Just wild!"
"Ohhhh God i was cringing so hard, i don&#39;t know what is this obsession with men&#39;s height???? I am 165cm ( i think that is 5.5) and i think 5.8 is a great height. The first man also sounded like a real gentleman i couldn&#39;t believe he was eliminated."
Davis Christopher Garcia Lisa Johnson Kenneth
"These women think a 25 year old Tyson Beckford is going to come around that corner lol. Maybe he will but don&#39;t count on it when a good dude is standing in front of you. The second guy looks like a great man. He&#39;s dressed well. He carries himself with confidence, respect, and presents himself well. The first girl finds him very attractive but because he&#39;s on point as the average height of a man (at 5&#39;8&quot;) it&#39;s a no go. Why are men single into their 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s? Because we aren&#39;t Tyson Beckford lol."
"How is a gift supposed to be earned? Anything that&#39;s earned is a transaction, Sir... a gift is a gift. It&#39;s something that is given out of love with no expectations in return."
Huberts definitely on his period
pressure buss pipes and balloons...LMAO
These dudes would not pop in real life
she’s literally black
is the tall bald dude literally gay or ??
Micah looks like p diddy
then they keep talking about the gifts like it’s common sense lmao 😂😂😂 if you love your woman you do it nobody forcing you
he tried to call the first girl feisty bc she made a valid point
The one that said she had lipstick on her teeth and hair pedicure was not right what an asshole he didn’t even look good so idk who is talking she was beautiful and classy those guys are jokers!
The first women will always be single and die alone with her cat
"“Shower me with gifts!” Not love. Not kindness. Not a happy life. Those are things to shower someone with too.  Gifts y’all!  You feelin me? And in return, I will do nothing but give you a hard time for the reminder of your life!<br><br>PS The Second Lady seemed really sweet. Even the guys who popped their balloons she was cool to. Even though most weren’t really deserving. And some of these guys had the personality of those pimps in all those black-exportation movies of the seventies. Or maybe it was just a bit of nervousness with these guys so they reverted to portraying a certain type of guy they feel is cool. That would be kinda juvenile if that were the case, but it is what it is.  Either way I feel she was much better off."
This group of 🥷🏾 must be 🌈 nun was wrong with any of these females.
La melted my heart with the he wants a black woman because you barely hear that now a days from black men 🥰❤️
Hubert definitely gives moody and nonchalant
Micah was lettin people down gently the whole time ! I don’t know what he was lookin for but it was not there.
These dudes are weird AF
Hubert play for the other team
"Why do they always back up like that, it’s not a rule to do so lmao it always gets to me 😭"
Dude in all black might be a  smoker the way he  holding that Toothpick
Saying that you lead but have your arm folded while referring to a woman as “mannish” is crazy work.
Hubert make funny faces lol
My baby girl in the light blue gown sweetness I need your instagram
"I really liked Danny. How many kids he had was kind of ambiguous, but he seemed kind and had good style. I say kind because for the first lady, he took the time to explain why the others had a problem with her wanting gifts. I feel like he talked himself out of it, but they seemed like a good match that would balance each other. 🤷🏽‍♀️ Hubert has been hurt before (probably bullied) and gives textbook incel vibes. Dude, you need to heal. You’ve already decided no one would want you, so you beat them to rejecting them first. But not only rejecting, you tear them down when they have done nothing to you but expose your fragile ego. You alone are creating the vicious cycle of rejection you feel a victim to."
Justice for the first girl
"Dude with a face tat should have been screened more, he seems like has a few loose marbles in there"
Ion like how they did my girl (2nd girl)
Bro jumped roped with his laces to pump his self up before the show 😂💀
"It looks like they don&#39;t like black, beautiful, and intelligent women."
Hubert is a B word
"I guess people want what they want. However, that first guy, hes going to have a hard time finding a woman who doesnt want kids and will just help with his kids. It’s completely unrealistic."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-YNkFCfK0&amp;t=3309"">55:09</a> WOW 😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️"
Not this man saying he wouldn&#39;t travel from ATL to Houston when he was ready to pick someone all the way in Wisconsin 😂
"The bald dude next to the last guy seemed unimpressed and disinterested in all the ladies but, was side-eyeing his neighbor with the shades zestfully the whole show and was giving all the women dirty looks 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Not understanding the African Diaspora is also WILD 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
"Everyone look at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-YNkFCfK0&amp;t=1743"">29:03</a> and pause the video to see Arlette face 😂 I definitely agree do not bring Hubert back 😂😂🙅🏾‍♂️"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-YNkFCfK0&amp;t=1153"">19:13</a> definitely love how she kept her composure, and kept it very demure. Cause man say them 12s are extra long with too tight bunny ears  don’t you think… 🙃"
Please dont bring Hubert’s ass back 😂😂
The 1st young lady &amp; the last with the red dress will forever be fine. Both of them look like the gym is part of their selfcare routines.
Poor Micah …. He was so nervous …. Very handsome
That First Lady is so beautiful and she deserves a better group of men who is willing to setup !
Johnny has been with another man before FAAAAACTSSSS 💯💯💯💯
These guys are all a no! 😂
Danny seems toxicccccc
I wanted Danny to find love❤
Danny is a time waster
Johnny seems homosexual
The 1st woman big red flag she don’t want to earn anything
"God, Spouse, Children.. that&#39;s the order, some of y&#39;all men need to learn this."
Hubert is so annoying. Like be ya self.
"This whole episode was cringy, especially with the first girl"
Hubert WTF did you come. The energy the whole time was like a kid in the candy store not getting their way! Like why come if he didn’t want to be there 🤦🏽‍♀️ that  🥷🏻 def waste ppl time cuz ain’t no way! How can we tag Arlette to let her know he’s not welcome HERE! 😒
Why is Hubert acting like he&#39;s cute??? Man barely a 3 steupsssss I could never.
Herbert go the hell home and don’t come back
Baaaaaaaby when Arlette said “ooohh!” I scrumpt!!! 😭😭😭😭
Some of these dudes are lame  . The excuses they make are ridiculous
Matured Women With Grace
Hubert is WAAAAAACCCCKKK!! 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Its like hubert was saying something to the guys because every time he said something the guy next to him pops his balloon 😮
Every time I watch this I realise black men are the problem and  don&#39;t know how to treat women. He popped his balloon because she wants the be a priority and love language is gifts. Madness.
red dress was talking toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much. felt like an eternity
These males are… children😅
"The first one with dude in the black just was wasting her time in the end. Asking all them questions, walked up there and everythjng, just to pop his balloon like sirrr😂. Go home Roger!😂"
Is Hubert okay?! Why does his face do that? 😂
That man not understanding what the definition of “opened to it” means is WILD! Y’all be blessed tho 😂
The 1st girl sounds dumb as hell. She will remain single for the rest of her life!
I don&#39;t understand why folks wear sunglasses inside.
Hubert is hella annoying!!! Ugh!!!!!
Hubert lost a bet? He’s so cranky… rude demeanor.
Was Hubart forced to be on the show?
Oouuu she’s a broward girl
Great  show Young lady and you be Slaying by the way.....
Do people no longer wait until marriage to have kids? It&#39;s crazy how many of these participants have multiple kids out of wedlock.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-YNkFCfK0&amp;t=350"">5:50</a> i agree with him. Its alot of stepmoms on reddit that talk about how much they hate the step kids and how much the neglect them. And these step kids are 3-7.  Put your kids first."
I think that men got the wrong idea when she said prioritize her.
Insecure men call confident and secure women “MANISH” 😂💀
&quot;Come with your best&quot; but you have on ripped shorts and half of a vest. When did that become fashionable?
This show shows how unintelligent people are based off a 15 second meet and greet 😂
Now Hubert 😒
hubert pissing me off
"In social contexts, people may look to the actions of others to determine what is appropriate or effective. Is there a possibility of people popping a ballon or hearing what someone said and ending up being influence? This can be a social experiment in itself."
The Girl in thr Green that took thr Wig off was the Most Beautiful to me. I would marry Her ...❤❤❤....... she taugh me something deep just by watching her.
😂😂😂😂 Musiq SoulChild was Wild AF
What were all the guys shaking like strippers ....i can tell thede niggas scared 😂
Hubert… Yo Hubert!! nah go ask Hubert.. who are you talking about? Hubert.. Michael been looking nerve and surprise at the same time. 😂 Fk’n Hubert
Traffic Control Man : a cross guard
Maaan Mike seemed so nervous lol he almost exploded
Give a like for Adrian Broner 🤣🤣🤣
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-YNkFCfK0&amp;t=3015"">50:15</a> Mike looks toooooo HYPED‼️💯😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭"
Gon be a Loooooooooootta Sangle broads around this bitch showtly!! Young Bulls are coming into a FIELD DAY of sorts......... wont end well though😂😂
I’m glad she shut up old man Hubert.
Nigga said have a good night 😂😂😂 what???
Who hubert think he is
Hubert lame ass was trying to clown her talking about &quot; I see a braid&quot; and GAGGED when she was bald underneath lmfaoo. Hubert irritating me BAD
I love the match between Chad and chick. They had the  best vibe and cute together
Lady in red is not too skinny.  Her weight is fine.  She is gorgeous.
You ladies absolutely suck.😂Too many good men went by. ❤<br>Redo!
"Lady in creme or white  outfit, is gorgeous."
"Hubert, you need to go home."
"Beautiful lady does not look as if she has any children.  She is gorgeous, beautiful body.  You two look great together.  Beautiful couple.  She made a great choice with this young man.  I think the two will make a great couple.  Congratulations you two.  Marriage will be on the agenda for you two.  Good luck."
The last man pulled the best of the best one in the line up. 👌
I have a question but i mean no harm at all but why are there only a certain type of people selected. Im not from America but where are all the other ethnicities?
"First guy: I&#39;m looking for someone who&#39;s going to be supportive of ME, help ME with MY business and MY goalsanddreamsandWHATNOT<br>....no one popped their balloon 🤔💀"
Esther??????? 💔
"I love the show’s concept, but it could use a lil improvement. Such as; why have them stand for over an hour? They can all sit in a tall chair. 2: once the single person comes out, have a lil intro music instead of everyone just looking and waiting for them to come out. 3: once the single person has approached, have other men/women all state their names, age and occupations. That way they don’t have to say it on repeat every single that the person has a question, pop a balloon or get their balloon popped. Other than that the show is great and intriguing. I literally watch it everyday. Great show."
This first guy has not given any lady a compliment about her looks. He is gay!
"Ngl, &quot;First off Queen&quot; got me started on this show. I loved the way he clapped back. The women were extra rude tonight lool 😅"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=1055"">17:35</a> is way out of his league, I doubt that he&#39;s educated and she&#39;s studying to be a doctor. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=1205"">20:05</a> called it. He is not intelligent or educated."
Thought they were judgmental about Chandler but they were right all along! 😹<br>You deserve better Mishna!
I hate the first guy
They are all  wearing fake hair
First one says a microwave society we want things too fast just like how she wants long straight European fur type  flowing  hair too fast hence the fake hair wearing.  As a medical student she should be aware of the dangers  health risk of wearing fake hair.
Heavy make up and fake ridiculous eye lashes.
He says it hard to pop the balloons it didn&#39;t seems hard he just went right ahead and pop the balloons with enthusiasm.
Mothers  Mothers ps be a role model for your children
Bleached out no class
No class
Why do  these type of fake women  always flicking / stroking / playing with the fake eurocentric fake fur type  hair
Had to do a recap on Chandler 😅
whatever you say about the guy. he is the ghost; he just went home with the baddest one
"I think the girl in red, Briana is suffering from pretty privilege. I think, for my tastes, she is fine! but the attitude? If you watch her closely I think she rolled her eyes more than any other female, even when he was talking to other females."
The 22 year old taking Arlette’s microphone’s killing me!!
"The second guy’s the ideal look in a man.Tall, attractive and well-built."
"Now I get why so many black men are playing for the other team.  These women are, nevermind......"
Man women don&#39;t come looking for love they come looking for clout it&#39;s so annoying
Besides the fact that my boy seemed like he was bout to beat one of the ladies up 😂 Dog was really well spoken… I feel like he a really good dude 4real.. I feel like he probably had a hard time wit chics back in the day and that’s why he responds how he do when it comes to rejection.. BUT I DEFINITELY DIDNT SEE OL GIRL PICKING DAT BOY!! They say opposites attract!!
This episode annoyed me so bad. A lot of these girls need to humble themselves. The chocolate guy that was actually dressed like a man and not a 21yr old rapper should&#39;ve got way more acknowledgement than what he got. These girls look young and immature and I did not like the wardrobe on these girls. They looked like they were auditioning for a rap video.
"The girls were a little mean, but this last man was very critical of the intense criticism"
The last dude is something else mmmaaannnn You did me a favor baby
They always say Mother or Aunt when the lady is heavier. 😅
Antoine would’ve made a good match with Brianna…
I wonder what is this  22yrs old doing here.
Blue dress bad asl fw her vibe
"They were so mean to Shanlar, it&#39;s always the guys that I think are so cute and wholesome that they always hate on. They did the same thing to Pointer😭"
Girls tripping over 1 year age difference is super strange
The last dude I quote “ I don’t mean to be disrespectful but if I see you in public I won’t reach out “ 😂😂😂😂😂
"Short man did wayyyyyy too much the extra comments was really not necessary or attractive on him, but I do like how the young lady cleaned it all up at the end , he lucky she was still interested in him after all of that.."
"Bring back normal English. Stop with this &#39;Not giving&#39; , &#39;she ate&#39; and all that bullshit"
I like this show it kinda broadens my horizons in terms of dating. Like there is a lid for every pot. Entertainment. Plus I learn some new vocabulary on every episode. I believe it’s called “swag”
Mike Tyson son? Mick Tyson
"I honestly thought girl on blue was my age too (40) she does look motherly and even though it&#39;s not a bad thing, it&#39;s not what a 27 yo guy is looking in a 23 yo girl."
Love these so much. My 1 critique is that the intros are a little long. I always have to skip past.
Ninja Turtle 🐢
Ryan is a Taurus
i am cryingggggg bro the last dude got me weak
"The plumber should get his own show, he is the male version of Hawk Tuah"
Bro why all the girls are 🤮
The second guy they didn’t want to tel him he too dark
Can&#39;t believe who black dress ended up with
Kayla is so ghetto but I love the way she went off on ninya boy lol
He means a woman not to give him drama. A woman gives peace
Brianna should go to hair dresser and put clothes on
The host always laughing .
He&#39;s eating right and taking care of himself and she keeps asking more questions.  Girl bye
No man wants to date his mother ladies. He doesn&#39;t need another mother he wants a wife
"As a bouncer, I say the last guy is bad news. I would encourage all the ladies to pop them balloons for this one. No respect given there. The ladies are not the best fit for my choice either, but I won&#39;t bring them down like he did."
"The one in the red is not so bright, not meaning the host."
Arlette was shocked Ninja Turtle matched and so was everyone else on set and at home 😂😂
That girl in black at the front lost out on a really cute guy because he said SOMEONE ELSE looked like a mother. Wow.
Aron aka ninja turtle came on guns blazzing🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
He got everybody lookin at their arms
That plumber is a star and girl in pink the baddest girl they ever had here
WTF these women talking about men wanting someone like their mother? So creepy and gross. No wonder they end up stuck with babies instead of full grown men.
The way Arlette says “we have a match” in complete disbelief at the last guy 😂😂😂
Dude got one arm bigger than the other i mean everyone has something going on but he act like he&#39;s dope crazy that tan shirt on ninja turtle 🐢
I came back to rewatch Chandler and Mishna’s episode SPECIFICALLY after the reunion and dude….he is definitely a chronic gaslighter. I didn’t get the vibe that he was “settling” or picked her because she was the only one left. He dead seemed like he liked her…like WHAT?!!! Am I being gaslit right now????😂😂😂😂
ninja turtle 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=3197"">53:17</a> Bruh would you wear that to a job interview???  Use your head, what do you think a first date is??  First impressions matter.  The outfit is giving, &quot;I don&#39;t really care to put in much effort for you or myself, I&#39;m a joke and don&#39;t take me too seriously.&quot;  And your response to her is giving, &quot;I don&#39;t really care how I look or how people perceive me, I would even wear this outfit to meet your parents for the first time because that&#39;s what makes ME feel comfortable.  I don&#39;t care if I come across as looking like a bum, fu*k your feelings.&quot;  <br><br>First impressions, I would pass too.<br><br>Does the dude really have on an anime shirt????  Yeah nothing screams &quot;take me seriously&quot; like an anime shirt  🙄."
"Soo, i saw the plumber clip a while ago and still think he&#39;s off. But after seeing these ladies interactions with other people they kind of deserve it,lol"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=1398"">23:18</a> , these girls attitudes are terrible"
bruhh the mother comment 😅
I really liked this one 👍🏽👍🏽
😂😂😂 the last one
one thing Arlette gonna do is adjust that mic when need be and make sure you don&#39;t walk off wit it 😅 also can I borrow your toothpicc so you can be eliminated lol
The girls who hung around for the plumber really want a to be mistreated 😂😂
Lol. I wonder how the last date went 😂😂
"That first lady left Ryan for Ninjaturtleman😅, she had the worst taste😅"
😂
First guy: he is SOOO out of these fat girls league
"I actually think the first guy is pretty good, he seems to have a good head on his shoulders"
Oh my God they let the plumber do too much. 😮 😂 He was scary and funny at the same time
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=2732"">45:32</a> Came back to watch Chandler 🫠🤦🏾‍♀️"
PICNIC⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️⁉️
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=1482"">24:42</a> definitely giving Nigerian vibes ❤"
I😂😂😂😂 if i see you in public ill won&#39;t reach out
How does raggedy ass thrift store wearing clothes guy have the right to make comments on somebody else&#39;s outfit?!<br> Get down!!!
"It always bothers me whenever the guys say that the outfit isn&#39;t right on the women, claiming that they should have been more put together. Yet the one saying that is wearing paint splash jeans and a raggedy ass t-shirt"
That plumber make me SICK..lolololol Glad someone told his AZZ
Girl in black one-shoulder dress looks dated like she’s from 1989 or something.
“My parents are black black”-says the white guy!😂
Aaron is disgusting. 🤢 <br>None of the women were as rude to  Chandler as Aaron was to them. Aaron thinks he only has to be respectful to women he finds attractive. A 🤡
Chandler was def dominant
Ninja Turtle needs to lower the eyebrows when he talks.
Where bro got that bob marley shirt
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=1957"">32:37</a> ok I understand you have questions, but even I feel interrogated. She irritating, like daaaaayuuumm pop that mf🤣<br>🎈📌💢"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSCIPEc4bS0&amp;t=2735"">45:35</a>"
Chandler really played her. He did not have to match with her if he knew he wasn’t attracted to her or interested
I’m so confused about what’s happening with the last guy and girl. Is she gonna publicly humiliate him? This can’t be a real match.
"“You not qualified, baby” is my new phrase. 😂"
"Woman in red, 4th one down, looks a little wild 😂 Where y’all find her? She’s on drugs fr"
"I&#39;m sorry, but i don&#39;t see any resemblance to the beautiful Janet Jackson in the young lady, although she is cute."
I&#39;m getting brainwashed into these Gournmet Pies! How was he even allowed to advertise his pies soo heavily haahahahaha
"The first girl is soo Fking dumb, like why not say from the start cause of your brand deals, I can&#39;t specify my exact age but it&#39;s around 30-33, or 35-38, like Shee not only withholding information but a Pathological liar!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4087"">1:08:07</a> A truly regal, beautiful couple. Class will Always win out."
The 1st broad trippN what makes her think she comes before somebody’s child if it was hers she would put her kid first like wth wrong with these woman 😂
Janet Jackson! He needs new classes. Hell No!
Came back after the reunion to rewatch the proposal 😊
Sorry but James with gourmet pies was annoying AF! Dont come on here to promote your phucking pies! You actually DETERRED people from supporting
saw the TikTok clip and had to come watch. im in my mid 20s and I loved the maturity in this video. the last girl was my fav. she had a whole vibe to her that makes you want to be her friend.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4980"">1:23:00</a> He was itching to pop that balloon. I just knew he would wait until last minute to pop his balloon, but he wasn&#39;t banking on his cousin getting that date."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=135"">2:15</a> sounds practised script 😂😂😂"
The girl who is a systems wearing all white is &quot;let me lock in&quot; fine. 😅
what is the first guy wearing??? lmao
Very good line up
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4640"">1:17:20</a> she seems genuine, I watched the catch-up with her and her match a few weeks ago."
James gourmet pies!
Shawty in the pink pants STRANGE AF!
Man where she gone find men over 30 with no kids most men kids are almost grown and she want to start girl bye
the wanna be comedian is an idiot
Not that man with the afro saying you welcome after complimenting her ahahahah sour!!!
"Yall tripp8ng about the &quot;black barbie &quot;. She doesnt come off too friendly, not smiling much l, and has a bad wig"
"When the Barber said he was a Barber, I had to zoom in"
It’s so sad it feels like the light skin girls get chosen or are given more of a chance <br>The darker skin or more melanated get popped soooo quickly like superficial much ?
Brian fine af
Will someone please pick James and them darn pies 🥴
He&#39;s going to need a bigger oven.
This first lady is annoying! She shouldn&#39;t be allowed to not say her age.
These men are fussy man she was a ten
They are talking about superficial things that can be adjusted. A physical attraction is a must first.
James w james gourmet pies been on this show a million times that man there to promote 😹
Did they mamas not teach them to not say  you think someone older
"The First Lady was great, only thing is her not telling her age. 😬 Yeah, I don’t trust nor like that."
the comedian trying to be funny but not being funny is so annoying
“Permanent” bru got the Kevin gates vibe 😂🤣
"If you didn’t learn anything from this video, you learned that “James gourmet pies shops nationwide”<br><br>Lemme go order some of bru pies 💯😂(pause)"
Men on the suit has WISDOM 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
The man in purple is legit handsome! I don’t understand all the balloon pops! Him and the gentleman with the blk/white shirt next to him.. both handsome men!
She doesn&#39;t like the Angela Bassett comment lmao
I would&#39;ve kicked James off the show after the 3rd JAMES GORMET PIES TBH He&#39;s clearly there only to sale his business
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4212"">1:10:12</a> &quot;I hope you find your match today.&quot; HOW SWAY EVERYONE POPPED THEIR BALLON 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Prince is a Lil weird lol
"why did you pop his  balloon?  Mini skirt woman says &quot;Honestly,that was really hard!,i guess the attraction level wasn&#39;t really there&quot; 👀Uuuum,why was it so hard then 🤯😂😂"
Y’all fumbled the dental student 🤦‍♂️
Last guy is just there to plug in his Instagram 😂😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=1665"">27:45</a> <br><br><br>👆"
"Russell Westbrook (Bryan) has an attitude problem 😂<br><br>The commedian dude is just weird. <br><br>&quot;Rev. Luke James&quot; (Reginald) bagged him one😂<br><br>Ernesto with the fd up haircut, must have the front chair at the shop. 😂😂😂<br><br>Poet homie got a head like a Pez Despenser😂<br><br>James Gourmet pies is a marketing genius 😂"
The first dude in purple was fiercly trying to pop that balloon😅
I love james❤❤❤❤
the first girl is 35 🤨😒 you aint no spring chicken baby
This whole group of men good looking
James was there to promote his pies. He doesn’t give a damn about any of those women
All tall women all short men 😂
James is alright with me
not the cousins fighting out out for love bring bacc the gurl who sang the song 😂😂
so she just everybody fren 🙄
for the first match I&#39;m glad it was them 🎉
I see we have the consistent theme of the class clown
for some reason I really want a pie 😅
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4084"">1:08:04</a> yoooooo the comedians face 😂😂😂, is the same one I had… I honestly thought she was feeling the short king."
"Honestly, I thought Ryan was a man. Jesus lmao"
"Guys, learn from my boy Eric from the Yoruba tribe. His attire showed confidence and that he was different, yet he bagged the most beautiful girl on this episode. Pin this! Girls love different."
Reginald is a dream!!! He&#39;s one of the best men standing!!! Go Reggie!!
The first two are dressed terribly. The one guy w/that sweater full of wholes. Is that in style now b/c to me it looks awful.
I saw Eric in Episode 6.. Is it because the relationship with the person he met did not work out or is he a  volunteer?
"I never liked pie, but James made me start eating it. I had to look him up on Google, and unfortunately, he’s far away from me."
Can we all just appreciate Arlette for looking STUNNING every episode!!! QUEEN
Pink girl seemed so hurt they all popped 🥹
The tall guy (first one by Arlene) has had 2 matches I’ve seen so far. The girl in the white dress not picking shorty surprised me a tiny bit. He was talking good game lol. Maybe she could tell he was a douche lol
"If I hear James gourmet pies again, out this dude!!! I just may be convinced he’s sweet as James gourmet pies!! Dam, bro is the new improved Forrest Gump..🥴🥴"
Orange dress girl is beautiful but she stressed me out when she talked idk why lol
Mike popping on the curly haired girl 😒
A lot of these men missed out on a woman based off of what she didn’t like in the other men. How u gone compare y’all haircuts to each others…
Mike has the sexiest voice ever omg
The first girl has beautifullllll energy!
“You gonna have height surgery?” 😮😂😂😂😂 she believed that shit 😮
OMG Kay is so cute with that pixie cut and spring dress!
These tall girls got popped on QUICK!
This super religious dude is freaking me out.
Priest wanna be kevin gates so bad.
That comedian gonna be single<br>For ever 😂😂
"Did the first lady really just say she wants to be a priority over someone’s kid? I don’t know a whole lot of people who do that. And if they do, they’re not mentally healthy."
The third lady is just absolutely stunning ❤ Barbie vibes Naomi Campbell
Most of the time the guys are so respectful and mature while the girls are so shallow. What&#39;s up with that?
The second guy who popped his ballon said he like her natural hair…how does he know her hair is natural?😂
"Say that again. However, I can understand where she is coming from."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=3480"">58:00</a> I know the word says he who finds a wife finds a good thing, but she hit the jackpot!!! Reginald has a sweet, upstanding, Godly spirit... It&#39;s palpable. That&#39;s what i&#39;m talking about. Good man. Nothing against other guy, just saying. I pray those two are thriving. We need an update 😁 💕"
"😂 &quot;Turn it into art, make that money, take you shopping.&quot; Priest is hilarious!!"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=3465"">57:45</a> I NEED AN UPDATE PLEASE"
Why guy #1 dressed like that
"I thought Eric( the guy with the long black gown) got a match like few months ago in the previous video, so what went wrong with the match?"
"James, the Pie Man, is the most clever. 😂😅"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MPpxDbyaKc&amp;t=4394"">1:13:14</a> 😅"
Some of these Brothers look older then their age.
Arlette the host is the truth. Best lokking woman on the show.
Whats up with the comedian? 😅😅😅😂😂😂 He seems so unserious at times.
James gourmet pie he funny as hell😂😂😂n da uncle Charles dem two gettin they&#39;re shiiittt <br>💯🇻🇮🇻🇮🇻🇮🇦🇬🇦🇬🇦🇬 ONE 💞LVE<br>✌🏾OUT 🫡😛😜🤪
Why did the girl in pink wear that outfit??  It’s not flattering.
"The guy with the dangly scarf/hat on his head and all the holes in his sweater, is a damn weirdo."
Love from San Antonio!
Haven&#39;t we seen the Sade red/orange dress on a similar woman.<br><br>That leads me to believe the show provide dresses for the women who choose wear them. The show needs to vary their selection. All of the dresses are tight. Most are not very classy.
When a guy says he has no red flags. That means he has no standards. That’s why none of these chicks wanted anything to do with him having no standards means you’ll go for anyone or anything out of desperation.
Bryan lives on this show. I hope he finds love so he can take his aggressive ass home.
You don&#39;t like the pantsssss
Brian hates women
Do all these women sit on their back all day and eat?
Brian was too aggressive and he says he had no deal breakers and gives grace but in the end he was judgmental about the women their kids and the number of fathers. Double talk and I am not sure he knows himself. He felt rejected but he was because he was to aggressive.
Brian…. Brian….. top tier????  😮
M1st guy is confused and has been cheated on because of his short comings
So many contradictions
Brian was pissing me off. He clearly can’t take no for an answer!! Huge red flag!
"I&#39;m sorry, but pink dress got to much attitude, and the dress isn&#39;t flattering. You work for the county and have a son dressing like a 304"
That&#39;s right Brian! Hold these girls accountable
Boi your deal breaker is multiple baby daddies... could&#39;ve said that. But he came for war😂😂😂
Serious bbw here
"This was my favorite episode.  Most of the right questions were asked. The women were secure, professional, and knowledgeable about themselves. Very fun!"
"I’ll say this about the hostess, the only thing I’d change about her approach, I wouldn’t try and dig to deep into why someone isn’t interested. Once someone say it’s about tattoos or smoking, something that’s really about personal choice, I’d just leave it alone. Maybe it’s just me, but when you start digging, it gives the possibility for people to get too personal. If one is physically not attractive to someone. I mean we all are attracted to those we are attracted to. I just don’t want to hear that somebody’s nose is too long, a little to heavy, they have a scar on their leg that looks unappealing. Just keep it classy, respectful."
These ladies are too old to acknowledge that judgment isnt real and that having multiple children by multiple men isnt a good look.
&quot;You gon lie to the public? &quot;😂😂😂😂hilarious
Brian went there to win the prize but acting like he is the prize .
Shay is pretty but that dress looks like cheap prom. Her outfits on IG look much better.
Emotional intelligence is defined as your ability to identify and understand why you may feel the way that you do. All of those answers were superficial
Brian is such an a-hole
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWr-qjauKa0&amp;t=1893"">31:33</a> if you came here from the future (episode 24) to see Tim again. Here is your chance."
3rd dude dressed like he’s going to six flags w his son
3 kids from 3 different dads and you on a dating show.. yikes
"i think the first guy is from the ghetto, from new orleans"
First nigga a crash out 🤣🤣
That man is still looking for a good woman lol
He sounds institutionalized and for certain hates rejection!
He sounds like he’s institutionalized and for certain hates rejection!!
He sounds like he’s institutionalized and for certain hates rejection!!
"Calm tf down, Brian! Whoever hurt you is not on that stage.  Deal with your trauma, and you&#39;ll probably be a great guy."
"Can you never let Brian talk again? The more episodes I see him, the more he urks me. SHUT UP. You spit positive negativity. Split tongue ahhh."
Thin Shay in the purple dress got humiliated. 37 and still waiting to take her realtor exam. Definitely not a catch. Dude thought she was over 45.😂😂😂😂 Damn.
"A lot of people don’t understand Brian because Brian is a real man. He might be a little bit forward but he’s just being real and if he would like to meet me, I would love to meet him. I’m from the Bronx New York. I have a good amount of years over Brian, but I wouldn’t mind talking to Brian online, because that type of man, you know where is coming from and you know how to deal with him versus the ones who play games and constantly I mean, constantly changing their answers there’s feelings based on the mood of of the day"
"Honestly speaking, I am Mario O’Brien. He’s my type of guy, but I’m definitely older than Brian and the age gap is a bit. I have an 18 year-old son, but he matches my type of guy and this is a second time. I’ve watched the show because I admire him and his energy, his realness and the fact that he doesn’t base you on your past and that’s a beautiful thing thing."
the first man he is scary
Dude wit the box braids might like men tbh. Them women wayyyyy to pretty tf
He made the bity look bad
I think Reggie and the short girl in the brown dress would have made a great couple
"This Brian man got mommy issues and it screams arrogance, no birth father figure in his life, grew up with having multiple part time daddies."
The first one on the end dress like missus parker from Friday the movie
Brian is crazy ass shit!!! Run sis.... RUN!!!!!😂😂😂
I got a feeling Brian is gonna be on the ID channel next.
The popping balloon sound will forever fry me
"&#39;Top tier,&#39; he say.<br>That&#39;s rich coming from a slue footed man."
I wonder where Brian is from
"Black dress, that wig is not it. 😭"
3rd guy in braids was doing well until he said that lady is 45 😂
"First guy, and that&#39;s why you single."
"Brian was right and respectful, all these women will eventually end up with a bunch of cats that&#39;s for sure"
Dese girls lame as hell bruh
Arlette&#39;s got the mint mobile fit but it is clean
"&#39;twice is on you&#39; and all that fucking judging. Dude had me angry. Look at these fine women, not just out here looking like tens but also strong women, that raise kids all on their own and after past hurts still have the courage to look for love. Much respect and love to these women and a big &#39;f you!&#39; to stupid ass Brian (from the ghetto)."
1st dude got that liquor in his system this episode 👀💀
1st dude got that liquor in his system this episode 👀💀
"Christian was definitely my favorite, I’m so glad he found a match 🎉❤ happy for them"
The first guy is too aggressive to the ladies. He looks like a case waiting to happen.
Boy bye...
That 1st guy hates women
I hate when you ask someone for their toxic trait and they use that as an opportunity to toot their own horn. Like “my toxic trait is that I love too hard” 🙄🙄
She is not top tier  stop lil mama
They don&#39;t  get it they  challenging too make it make sense  these  dating  page  be all cap they ain&#39;t even looking for nobody  at all they just coming on her just to be seen  no cap or looking for contact these women  33 and up they need to get it together
i think he&#39;s from louisiana
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWr-qjauKa0&amp;t=3050"">50:50</a>  Agreed sir, you did a very nice job picking out your outfit and the jewelry to go with it, you look very nice.  The only thing I don&#39;t like about your outfit is the shoes.. Not a fan of the athletic shoes with dressy suit attire.  It&#39;s like me wearing one of their dresses with your shoes...  It doesn&#39;t look right...  To me.<br><br><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWr-qjauKa0&amp;t=3109"">51:49</a>  Be careful girl with this generation hearing you say that,  you know that they don&#39;t like gender roles and love seeing males in dresses and finger nail polish..."
Out of all the ones I watched this one by far got the baddest line up
I thought you’re supposed to dress to impress?🤷🏿‍♀️ I can’t people go to a first date dressed like they’re going to the club.🤦🏾
"He is judging women with 2 children, but he has 1 child and is on a dating show? Also, he said he doesn&#39;t judge but out here judging these women?😅😅 what a joke"
"He is judging women with 2 children, but he has 1 child and is on a dating show? Also, he said he doesn&#39;t judge but out here judging these women?😅😅 what a joke"
Dude with braids like boys! Idc Idc!!! There&#39;s no way he ain&#39;t attracted to any of them and they all look different! 😂😂😂
The first guy irritated my soul. How do you start off saying you have no deal breakers but bash those women for having more than one baby daddy  🚩 I have 1 but I think it’s absurd to think the older you get there will be multiple women with one baby daddy interested in a A hole like this guy
&#39;how many baby daddies?&#39; ....
“U kinda remind me of my nephew”😭😂 that choke me…he really is 😂
Open to put asian women here at least they are actual women.  No drama or toxic
“My name is Christian” 😂💀
He said he didn&#39;t judge but he do smdh
Christian’s was the definition of a gentleman and I hope everyone of these women find their Christian that’s right for them
The second guy is broke. 1st guy told the truth! I&#39;m sorry he was on point.
"At first I was just listening and I kept thinking Brian is irksome, he like to repeat himself and hear himself talk, he a mild Dr Elom. Then I looked and realized it was that dude. He had a whole lot of deal breakers his first episode."
Why when one woman pop all pops? Followers
"To say making a mistake with any of the women’s baby daddies, give me a break, how many people have rose to greatness even tho their mama had a baby daddy that they felt was a mistake"
"Wow everyone of these women are drop dead gorgeous, first guy came off wayyyyyyyyyyy ridiculous"
Am i the only one that doesn&#39;t believe the one in the black dress is only 42?
"#1.... Phew!!!! This dude judging them on having children with more than 1 person, but he will be doing the same thing because he has 1 and wants more🙄 lol! <br>Plus the way he kept rubbing his  hand was giving me pimp vibes!"
"The first guy gives off some REALLY awful vibes. The constant hand twitching reminds me of my ex husband,   he always did that when he was about to explode in anger and scream at me. Whatever woman ends up with him, good luck. 😬"
Bring the first guy again 😂😂😂
Where do they find these men at 😭😭
Dude in Roberto Cavalli look emotionally unstable.
This line up …. Idk
Rate Brian yf
"Okay wow, definitely wasn’t expecting the worlds most condescending, hypocritical, and aggressive misogynist to open the show🤣🫨"
Brian S.B.E.&#39;ed those 304s too much.
He said he was a man of Top Tier on the pop the balloon show.
First guy talks tooooo much 😢
😂😂😂😂 the black forces ARE INDEED criminal!!!!!
I agree totally with the First Gentleman who spoke for all the real men that are still left on earth. God scripture is clear on how woman should carry themselves.
First guy talking about he got no deal breakers and don&#39;t judge women on their past then say it&#39;s women faults for having two baby daddies cause their destination is the fault from their first situation...
Josh look sudanese lol. The northern ones.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWr-qjauKa0&amp;t=1018"">16:58</a> Dude playing the role of the hunter with that serial killer look and walk back lol. A lot of people who just get out of prison have this. But it might be him naturally lol. Agressive Kirk Franklin."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWr-qjauKa0&amp;t=780"">13:00</a> actually... he&#39;s actually speaking facts lol. A lot of women don&#39;t like hard truth. Women be choosing the wildest guys and leaving lames/nerds to date women of other places, then complain about good men."
Ion see how they popped on Mr Will…. They must be blind 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Another briefcase ? 🫣😂
Who the hell gone marry a stripper lol😂
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KluNOvWjkWY&amp;t=3820"">1:03:40</a> this lady inconsistent"
Why did you pop the balloon? <br>She: &quot;He don&#39;t have enough base in his voice&quot;<br><br>You can&#39;t be that dumb😂
That feet guy is crazy
I’m so concerned for the girl on the end
"SE dc is crazy , it’s the hood he tried it sis"
Girl Sydney dates my brova smh
Big up Trinidad 🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹
So we did get a couple of popped balloons<br>Aka practically the whole damn room 😂
Your 5ft but he too short when he 8inches taller than u 💀
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KluNOvWjkWY&amp;t=550"">9:10</a> shows that she just wanted to be like everyone else and stay on the show longer smh 🤦🏾"
Not chapped lips😂
"It appears the last woman is struggling to articulate her thoughts in a logical manner, giving the impression of being somewhat detached."
The guy with the bag was almost perfect. WTH?
The chick on the end irritates the hell outta me.
LADY IN THE WHITE! (Second one) <br><br>I’m very surprised by how down to earth she was! You don’t meet to many women that look like that and aren’t shallow
Damn you can’t be a police officer now 😭😭😭😭
90% of the lady&#39;s are too pickie for being mothers and most have regreated turning down some of the young men ?? Good luck Lady&#39;s
"The &quot;exotic dancer chic&quot;,  was really pretty surprised not matched. On the other hand this show is a guilty pleasure that  I&#39;m kind of ashamed to  admit watching albeit the lost brain cells...😆"
They passing up a while Prince😂.  This show need more mature women   . The clothes don’t make a man ladies
From the moment first guy came on and started speaking I was like “look ah trini” b4 he even confirmed it 🎉🎉🎉
"The last girl is a demon from hell she is a follower, she don&#39;t have a mind of her own she have serious issues"
Idk why it so annoying when they pop the balloon while they still talking
“Chapped lips..”.     he licked them joints fast as hell😂
The last girl resembles Tamar Braxton.
They really said “Fk the police”
"Although this group of women were very sexy, it&#39;s still among the least impressive groups of women this show has had. The reasons for popping were insane, and they seem very entitled. And then there is &#39;Cee,&quot; the woman who was attracted to the first guy, the cop. She made it known she was attracted to him, but since he was the first guy introduced, she wanted to see if something better would walk out later. Notice at the end of the show, she left empty-handed. I do think the first woman picked (the one with the hat), was sincere though."
Nkiru is far from finding love
Nkiru 32 still selective oh my Nigerian sister please get a man you look beautiful
They keep rejecting while their age keep going up.. most of them pop because the person close to them did pop
"First guy , that lady girl is a 304 lol why she she didn’t have a problem with him being a cop but possibly could lol"
What was that last girl talking about? She did not sound intelligent at all with that reason. Looking like she 35 talking like a teenager lol.
Of course<br>She&#39;s  beautiful <br>Pretty much it<br>No judgement<br>Too light <br>Too short<br>😅😅😅😅
Bless up ya self
she aint no fun size in her two sister dress and rain hat
"I’m so saddened that women in general focus so much on height.. I understand preferences, but it makes me sad for the men with lots of potential.."
"This entire episode was exhausting until the last two dudes, lol!"
Kiana 32 im in the healtbheakt health fieeeeldd 😂 girl wear scrubs at a hospital cus you def not smart 😅 too much bleach
Christian life coach 😂 w them thangs out gurl
"Sticking to the code, she’s a follower she didn’t know how to even describe what she meant, and sounded stupid.. I love the show but she of the young woman pop for the dumbest reason.."
"I don’t understand the reasoning here... You already have three kids with another person, but you’re not willing to have more with someone who doesn’t have any children. That’s confusing!"
"Ladies with all due respect stop getting these big tattoos.<br>They look like big bruises.<br>Get a small tat, or none.<br>Y&#39;all are so beautiful without them."
Lexi is so beautiful and elegant
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KluNOvWjkWY&amp;t=1770"">29:30</a> that girl in red cried when the man with luxury car rental biz popped her balloon and moved on to the next. She was thinking it is a chance lost to become an instant sugarbaby"
As grown ass women yall are actually that bothered by law enforcement as a career???<br>please grow tf up
"I am so sick of adults, in their 20s and 30s,using height as deal breaker"
"Lexi, you know that is not your hair.  The hesitation!😅"
"The last girl in the lineup is a follower. She follows whatever the other girls do. She actually said so when explaining why she popped for the cop. And to top it all, she really wants us to believe she is a cna, a realtor, and she supervises a shoe store ?? Girllll stop it already."
"I’m home sick so I’ve been binge watching this series. I’ve learned how much women contribute to a very narrow and rigid definition of masculinity. Too short, too pretty, too flashy, too boring, too zesty, too quiet… it feels like society is trying to squeeze men into a very tiny box 😣"
Duffle bag talks way too much. I cant deal. I know Arlette was annoyed
Kiana does not look 32. And she cant think fkr herself lol wth
"You would think they’d WANT good black men to be cops. If they think there’s a problem, they could Help change the system"
What the last chic is weird..what&#39;s wrong with her
The &quot;Feet&quot; guy cracks me up! 😂
I think these women are trippin🤔 why&#39;s he a pretty boy because he gets his brows done????? Enlighten me please I&#39;m from NY And dudes get brows done like it&#39;s called personal hygiene smh
"I really like Allister! I liked his tone, responses, and appearance. I hope he finds love!!"
The lady with the green dress is gorgeous!
Tiffany should stay at home!!!!!!! Shes everywhere lool
"I get that attraction and looks matter...but I just don&#39;t understand the pickyness. What matters most is personality,  I would love if this show would do some blindfold things so people could get to know the person on the inside first."
the lady in the green outfit pop every balloon straight off.   she  looks hard to get along with.
Coming to America came to date some feet while walking like a 🦆. He was really mean and fake.
the height excuse is so lame.   like a tall guy will solve your problems
last girl should learn how to think for herself.  that dude was like a robot .
these chicks all have many different jobs no wonder they cant find a man.
What’s with the props? Are y’all checking these bags for safety reasons?
"waiting for someone better,  good for her.  i know she already very patient."
sheriffs and police are not the same.
They are so gorgeous but its a real turn off when she&#39;s too picky ir superficial. But then again we got guys like that Jamie Fox comedian guy with the dancehall hat and no socks😂. Wtf!!!😂. Both men and women can easily improve so many things if they weren&#39;t so selfish😂. Its not that hard to please an actual GOOD man.
"Look… strong, short men can throw you around 😉 and protect you when needed. Y’all need to quit."
Nearly everyone popped when he said he was a sheriff and I suspect the other ones didn’t because they didn’t want to make him feel bad.
The officer saying that dating the exotic dancer is a dealbreaker...is LYING!
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KluNOvWjkWY&amp;t=1761"">29:21</a> that’s that fine lil shi"
Arlette always says we got a couple of balloons popped and it’s 7/9 women that popped. 😂😂
Da last pick was really hard da  exotic dancer wanted him  too...🤷🏾‍♀️ well he miss out on a good azz dance partner<br>💯🇦🇬🇦🇬🇦🇬🇻🇮🇻🇮🇻🇮 ONE💞 LVE <br>✌🏾OUT 🫡😛😜🤪
That guy with the weird hat and the foot thing was strange he cant talk about girls feet when he looks like that
Da lady in da green sounds like she from nigeria 🇳🇬  i knw she from an island 🏝 fo shizzle my nizzle <br>💯🇦🇬🇦🇬🇦🇬🇻🇮🇻🇮🇻🇮 ONE💞 LVE <br>✌🏾OUT 🫡😛😜🤪

"We need to see a convo between Coming to America, ninja turtle, and “Dr.” E"
"That last girl,  she&#39;s got a big ole bubble where her brain is supposed to be."
I think girl lied about her reason being because he was police... she popped b4 he said he was police.
@allistor 🇹🇹 stand up
"I’d love it if Mr I’m a Respectable Individual Police Officer.. ran his own successful youtube channel and went on to totally roast each and every single girl individually visually from head to toe and their demeanour uninterrupted, and he just waited it this episode out to do so 😋 women can be so phoney"
"Hey police bro, big up to you from sweet Trinidad and Tobago. Hope you find real love my Trini brother.  🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🇹🙏🏽"
Supects in a dress.😂
"I love how the first guy carried himself, hopefully he finds a match someday"
The first guy i wasnt attracted to him and his muffin top he seems nice but not my type
This line up pressure 🔥🔥
Figures the only one that looks nice doesnt have a mind of her own🙄.  These ladies need to ask Arlette about how to dress.
The briefcase guy.... run 🏃‍♂️ get out the blocks fast
I love the blackjack man! Keep it up!
The nigerian woman she is so beautiful.❤
"From the moment I heard him, I knew he was a Trini. Big up Trini brother!!"
Kierra is about that bag. I think Moan and the second guy was a little too mature for the women.
First guy is the whitest black guy I’ve seen on the internet.
"Bro, this lady really said she was sticking to rhe code.... Translation: hive mind. <br>This is why we call women stupid and dumb. Missed out on a potentially good dude because of lack of social proof. Just wild!"
"Ohhhh God i was cringing so hard, i don&#39;t know what is this obsession with men&#39;s height???? I am 165cm ( i think that is 5.5) and i think 5.8 is a great height. The first man also sounded like a real gentleman i couldn&#39;t believe he was eliminated."
Davis Christopher Garcia Lisa Johnson Kenneth
"These women think a 25 year old Tyson Beckford is going to come around that corner lol. Maybe he will but don&#39;t count on it when a good dude is standing in front of you. The second guy looks like a great man. He&#39;s dressed well. He carries himself with confidence, respect, and presents himself well. The first girl finds him very attractive but because he&#39;s on point as the average height of a man (at 5&#39;8&quot;) it&#39;s a no go. Why are men single into their 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s? Because we aren&#39;t Tyson Beckford lol."
"How is a gift supposed to be earned? Anything that&#39;s earned is a transaction, Sir... a gift is a gift. It&#39;s something that is given out of love with no expectations in return."
Huberts definitely on his period
pressure buss pipes and balloons...LMAO
These dudes would not pop in real life
she’s literally black
is the tall bald dude literally gay or ??
Micah looks like p diddy
then they keep talking about the gifts like it’s common sense lmao 😂😂😂 if you love your woman you do it nobody forcing you
he tried to call the first girl feisty bc she made a valid point
The one that said she had lipstick on her teeth and hair pedicure was not right what an asshole he didn’t even look good so idk who is talking she was beautiful and classy those guys are jokers!
The first women will always be single and die alone with her cat
"“Shower me with gifts!” Not love. Not kindness. Not a happy life. Those are things to shower someone with too.  Gifts y’all!  You feelin me? And in return, I will do nothing but give you a hard time for the reminder of your life!<br><br>PS The Second Lady seemed really sweet. Even the guys who popped their balloons she was cool to. Even though most weren’t really deserving. And some of these guys had the personality of those pimps in all those black-exportation movies of the seventies. Or maybe it was just a bit of nervousness with these guys so they reverted to portraying a certain type of guy they feel is cool. That would be kinda juvenile if that were the case, but it is what it is.  Either way I feel she was much better off."
This group of 🥷🏾 must be 🌈 nun was wrong with any of these females.
La melted my heart with the he wants a black woman because you barely hear that now a days from black men 🥰❤️
Hubert definitely gives moody and nonchalant
Micah was lettin people down gently the whole time ! I don’t know what he was lookin for but it was not there.
These dudes are weird AF
Hubert play for the other team
"Why do they always back up like that, it’s not a rule to do so lmao it always gets to me 😭"
Dude in all black might be a  smoker the way he  holding that Toothpick
Saying that you lead but have your arm folded while referring to a woman as “mannish” is crazy work.
Hubert make funny faces lol
My baby girl in the light blue gown sweetness I need your instagram
"I really liked Danny. How many kids he had was kind of ambiguous, but he seemed kind and had good style. I say kind because for the first lady, he took the time to explain why the others had a problem with her wanting gifts. I feel like he talked himself out of it, but they seemed like a good match that would balance each other. 🤷🏽‍♀️ Hubert has been hurt before (probably bullied) and gives textbook incel vibes. Dude, you need to heal. You’ve already decided no one would want you, so you beat them to rejecting them first. But not only rejecting, you tear them down when they have done nothing to you but expose your fragile ego. You alone are creating the vicious cycle of rejection you feel a victim to."
Justice for the first girl
"Dude with a face tat should have been screened more, he seems like has a few loose marbles in there"
Ion like how they did my girl (2nd girl)
Bro jumped roped with his laces to pump his self up before the show 😂💀
"It looks like they don&#39;t like black, beautiful, and intelligent women."
Hubert is a B word
"I guess people want what they want. However, that first guy, hes going to have a hard time finding a woman who doesnt want kids and will just help with his kids. It’s completely unrealistic."
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-YNkFCfK0&amp;t=3309"">55:09</a> WOW 😂😂🤦🏾‍♂️"
Not this man saying he wouldn&#39;t travel from ATL to Houston when he was ready to pick someone all the way in Wisconsin 😂
"The bald dude next to the last guy seemed unimpressed and disinterested in all the ladies but, was side-eyeing his neighbor with the shades zestfully the whole show and was giving all the women dirty looks 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Not understanding the African Diaspora is also WILD 😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨
"Everyone look at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-YNkFCfK0&amp;t=1743"">29:03</a> and pause the video to see Arlette face 😂 I definitely agree do not bring Hubert back 😂😂🙅🏾‍♂️"
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-YNkFCfK0&amp;t=1153"">19:13</a> definitely love how she kept her composure, and kept it very demure. Cause man say them 12s are extra long with too tight bunny ears  don’t you think… 🙃"
Please dont bring Hubert’s ass back 😂😂
The 1st young lady &amp; the last with the red dress will forever be fine. Both of them look like the gym is part of their selfcare routines.
Poor Micah …. He was so nervous …. Very handsome
That First Lady is so beautiful and she deserves a better group of men who is willing to setup !
Johnny has been with another man before FAAAAACTSSSS 💯💯💯💯
These guys are all a no! 😂
Danny seems toxicccccc
I wanted Danny to find love❤
Danny is a time waster
Johnny seems homosexual
The 1st woman big red flag she don’t want to earn anything
"God, Spouse, Children.. that&#39;s the order, some of y&#39;all men need to learn this."
Hubert is so annoying. Like be ya self.
"This whole episode was cringy, especially with the first girl"
Hubert WTF did you come. The energy the whole time was like a kid in the candy store not getting their way! Like why come if he didn’t want to be there 🤦🏽‍♀️ that  🥷🏻 def waste ppl time cuz ain’t no way! How can we tag Arlette to let her know he’s not welcome HERE! 😒
Why is Hubert acting like he&#39;s cute??? Man barely a 3 steupsssss I could never.
Herbert go the hell home and don’t come back
Baaaaaaaby when Arlette said “ooohh!” I scrumpt!!! 😭😭😭😭
Some of these dudes are lame  . The excuses they make are ridiculous
Matured Women With Grace
Hubert is WAAAAAACCCCKKK!! 🙄🙄🙄🙄
Its like hubert was saying something to the guys because every time he said something the guy next to him pops his balloon 😮
Every time I watch this I realise black men are the problem and  don&#39;t know how to treat women. He popped his balloon because she wants the be a priority and love language is gifts. Madness.
red dress was talking toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much. felt like an eternity
These males are… children😅
"The first one with dude in the black just was wasting her time in the end. Asking all them questions, walked up there and everythjng, just to pop his balloon like sirrr😂. Go home Roger!😂"
Is Hubert okay?! Why does his face do that? 😂
That man not understanding what the definition of “opened to it” means is WILD! Y’all be blessed tho 😂
The 1st girl sounds dumb as hell. She will remain single for the rest of her life!
I don&#39;t understand why folks wear sunglasses inside.
Hubert is hella annoying!!! Ugh!!!!!
Hubert lost a bet? He’s so cranky… rude demeanor.
Was Hubart forced to be on the show?
Oouuu she’s a broward girl
Great  show Young lady and you be Slaying by the way.....
Do people no longer wait until marriage to have kids? It&#39;s crazy how many of these participants have multiple kids out of wedlock.
"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-YNkFCfK0&amp;t=350"">5:50</a> i agree with him. Its alot of stepmoms on reddit that talk about how much they hate the step kids and how much the neglect them. And these step kids are 3-7.  Put your kids first."
I think that men got the wrong idea when she said prioritize her.
Insecure men call confident and secure women “MANISH” 😂💀
&quot;Come with your best&quot; but you have on ripped shorts and half of a vest. When did that become fashionable?
This show shows how unintelligent people are based off a 15 second meet and greet 😂
Now Hubert 😒
hubert pissing me off
"In social contexts, people may look to the actions of others to determine what is appropriate or effective. Is there a possibility of people popping a ballon or hearing what someone said and ending up being influence? This can be a social experiment in itself."
The Girl in thr Green that took thr Wig off was the Most Beautiful to me. I would marry Her ...❤❤❤....... she taugh me something deep just by watching her.
😂😂😂😂 Musiq SoulChild was Wild AF
What were all the guys shaking like strippers ....i can tell thede niggas scared 😂

Traffic Control Man : a cross guard

Nigga said have a good night 😂😂😂 what???
Who hubert think he is
Hubert lame ass was trying to clown her talking about &quot; I see a braid&quot; and GAGGED when she was bald underneath lmfaoo. Hubert irritating me BAD
I love the match between Chad and chick. They had the  best vibe and cute together
Lady in red is not too skinny.  Her weight is fine.  She is gorgeous.
You ladies absolutely suck.😂Too many good men went by. ❤<br>Redo!
"Lady in creme or white  outfit, is gorgeous."
"Hubert, you need to go home."
"Beautiful lady does not look as if she has any children.  She is gorgeous, beautiful body.  You two look great together.  Beautiful couple.  She made a great choice with this young man.  I think the two will make a great couple.  Congratulations you two.  Marriage will be on the agenda for you two.  Good luck."
